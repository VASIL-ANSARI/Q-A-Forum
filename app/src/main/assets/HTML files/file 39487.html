<p>First, you need supply field list to insert statement:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO Clients (ClientID)...
</code></pre>

<p>Second, your query doesn't insert any rows, because you check ClientID presence in same table. Did you mean someting like next:</p>

<pre><code>"Where DD.[Client ID] NOT IN (SELECT DD2.[Client ID] FROM " &amp; tableName2 &amp; " as DD2)"
</code></pre>
