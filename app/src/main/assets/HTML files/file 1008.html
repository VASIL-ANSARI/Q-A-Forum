<p>Clones are deep by default, thats the naming convention
and copy constructors can be shallow if they want, for performance reasons.</p>

<p>Edit: This naming convention goes beyond boundaries, its the same for .Net, Java, C++, Javascript, etc... the actual source is beyond my knowledge but its part of the standard Object Oriented lexicon, just like objects, and classes. Thus MSDN doesn't specify implementation because its a given by the word itself (of course lots of newcomers to OO languages don't know this, and they SHOULD specify it, but then again their documentation is quite frugal anyways)</p>
