<p>This may be caused by inline styles set by Nivo Slider, but it's hard to tell what the cause can be with example CSS/markup. </p>

<p>However the basics for responsive images is to make sure the <code>width</code> (or, often preferably, the <code>max-width</code>) is set to <code>100%</code> and that the <code>height</code> is set to <code>auto</code>. If there's inline CSS that will override your own CSS so you may either need to add <code>!important</code> to those rules or edit the plugin files for Nivo Slider and remove the printing of inline styles. </p>

<p>So basically, try this (but you may want to use a more specific selector and you shouldn't use <code>!important</code> unless it's <em>absolutely</em> necessary):</p>

<pre><code>img {
    max-width: 100% !important;
    height: auto !important;
}
</code></pre>
