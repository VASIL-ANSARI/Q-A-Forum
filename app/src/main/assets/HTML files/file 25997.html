<p>your problem is in menu.css on line 8:</p>

<pre><code>ul li {float: left;}
</code></pre>

<p>all lis in your site are floated left.  You need to specifically target which ones you want to float as you shouldn't float all of them </p>

<p>I think you use this line for your header navigation.  If you give the <code>ul</code> for the header nav an id:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="headerNav"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you can target that ul with</p>

<pre><code>ul#headerNav li {float: left;}
</code></pre>

<p>ps. you shouldn't use tables for layout, they are for tabular data only</p>
