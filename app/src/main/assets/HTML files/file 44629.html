<p>This happened to me when I upgraded various modules using <code>pip</code> and one of the dependencies automatically upgraded Django to the current version (1.8). You might just check what is your current Django version (<code>pip freeze</code>) and if it's 1.8 just downgrade to 1.6 line (<code>pip install -U "Django&lt;1.7"</code>).</p>
