<p>If you use XIB's and a lot of objects, then yes. If you plan on making the object do something special like disable the button during some method call later in code, then YES, hook up an IBOutlet. If you are only connecting the buttons to IBActions, then NO, just connect any button (without IBOutlet) to your IBAction, this will save you on connecting a bunch of objects.</p>
