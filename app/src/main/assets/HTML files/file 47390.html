<p>You can create a new extension, which provides a fluid view helper, that includes content from an external source. You just need to get the html sourcecode from the magento instance using curl and cut out the navigation part.
To speed things up, save the extracted content in a file in the typo3temp directory. If the specified file is present, it will return its content, else it fetches the content from magento.</p>

<p>Then you can create a TYPO3 scheduler command task, which deletes the file in the typo3temp-directory every 15 minutes. That will force the view helper to get fresh contents.</p>
