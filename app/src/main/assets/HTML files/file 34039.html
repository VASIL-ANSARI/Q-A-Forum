<p>The way you are creating your plugin is a little different than I would, as the "this" is the "fn.slides" scope 'this' - thus, it errors out.  I was able to solve your issue by passing the context of the "this" you want -- which is the 'h1' by using 'call'. With "call" (and "apply), I can call the function and pass in the 'this' context I want.</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {
  $.fn.slides={
    slideIn:function(){
      $(this).fadeIn().slideDown();
    },
    slideOut:function(){
      $(this).fadeOut().slideUp();
    }
  }
})(jQuery);

$('h1').click(function(){
  $(this).slides.slideOut.call(this);
});
</code></pre>
