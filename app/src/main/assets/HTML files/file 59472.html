<p>When you divide the int <code>height</code> by 100 it truncates the decimal since it is still an int. </p>

<p>Try initializing the variables as doubles:</p>

<pre><code>double weight;
double height;
</code></pre>

<p>Then cast them when you get the int from the input:</p>

<pre><code>weight = (double) console.nextInt();
height = (double) console.nextInt();
</code></pre>

<p>That way you're still taking an int for the input, but it acts like a double when you do your calculations.</p>
