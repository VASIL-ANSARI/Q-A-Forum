<p>Yes you can, you could change the default System.out to a file, a buffer, etc. and unit test that new stream for the expected data. But IMO that's a terrible terrible idea.</p>

<p>Other aproach woud be using a Logger instead the standard output and unit test the log, but once again it sounds weird unit testing a logger. At least if you are not developing a logging tool :)</p>

<p>To me it sounds like a bad understanding of what is unit testig, but I could be wrong.</p>
