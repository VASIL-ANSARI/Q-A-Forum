<p>In my company we used Java Web Start to deploy Eclipse RCP applications.  It was a pain to setup, but it works very well once in place.  So the only recommendation I could make is to start small, to get the hang of it.  Deploying one simple application first.  Trying to deploy a complete product that is already made without experience with JWS gets complicated rather quickly.</p>

<p>Also, learning how to pass arguments to the JWS application was invaluable for debugging.  Setting the Environment variable JAVAWS_VM_ARGS allows setting any arbitrary property to the Java Virtual machine.  In my case:</p>

<p>-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=4144</p>

<p>Helpful when you need to check problems during start-up (suspend=y)</p>

<p>I think the main problem for the acceptance of Java Web Start is that it is relatively difficult to setup.  Also, somehow there is this dissonance:  When you have a desktop application, people expects a installer they can double click.  When you have a web application, people expects they can use it right from the browser.  Java Web Start is neither here not there...</p>

<p>It is widely used in intranets, though.</p>
