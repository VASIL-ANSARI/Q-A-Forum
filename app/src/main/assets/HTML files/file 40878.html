<blockquote>
  <p>i open form 2 with a button in form 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Set Form1 as the Owner of Form2 when you open it, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Form2 f2 = new Form2();
f2.Show(this);
</code></pre>

<p>Now over in Form2, you can cast the Owner() property to the Form1 type and use it:</p>

<pre><code>// ... from within Form2 ...
Form1 f1 = (Form1)this.Owner;
Sqlfunctions.Refresh(f1.dataGridView1);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But</strong> you would need to select dataGridView1 in Form1 and change its Modifiers() property to Public for this to work.</p>
