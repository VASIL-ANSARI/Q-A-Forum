<p>During development on your machine (and using a browser that actually sends the full path, which proper browsers don't) that may work, but as soon as you deploy it on a server it'll break.</p>

<p>The easiest way would be to use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sdktyws(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>new Attachment(Attachment1.PostedFile.InputStream, "attachmentname")</code> constructor</a> to directly stream the uploaded file into your attachment without having to temporarily save it yourself.</p>
