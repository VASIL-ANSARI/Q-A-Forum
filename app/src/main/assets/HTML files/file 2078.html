<p>I wouldn't use regular expressions for this, it's extra overhead and complexity where a regular string function would suffice.  Why not go with <a href="http://php.net/stripos" rel="nofollow">stripos()</a> instead?</p>

<pre><code>$str = 'client';
$terms = array('cli','ent','cl');
foreach($terms as $t) {
    if (stripos($str,$t) !== false) {
        echo "$t exists in $str";
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>
