<p>Figured out how to fix this issue, but no idea what caused it.</p>

<p><code>oTable.fnFilter('some_val');</code> - caused the error and stopped all code below it.</p>

<p>added try catch blocks and the code below is no longer interrupted:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  oTable.fnFilter('some_val');
} catch (e) {

}
</code></pre>
