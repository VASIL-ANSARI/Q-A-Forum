<p>I think that is the same behaviour like in the Safari mobile browser. Any bookmark you save to the home screen, whether it's web app enabled or not, will refresh on opening.</p>

<p>One work around is to use Sencha Touch's support for routing. Whenever a new route in the app is opened, save that route in localstorage as "last_route" or something like that. On each load of the app you could then call controller.redirectTo(localStorage.getItem("last_route")); to go straight back to the last route (and therefore view) that the user accessed.</p>

<p>Have a read of Sencha's routing guide if you're not familiar with it:
