<p>To accommodate the height of the text inside, use <code>0</code> as the number of lines in the UILabel. That will automatically make them grow according to the text inside. You will also need to add a constraint from the last element inside your UIScrollView to the bottom of the scroll view, to avoid ambiguous content size.</p>

<p>To get the labels to be the width of the screen, it should be a straightforward constraint from the label to it's container. However, if the label is within the scroll view, you might have to constrain the label to have the same width as the scroll view, because constraining the label to the leading and trailing edges of the scroll view will constrain it to the scrollview's content view, which grows according to its contained views.</p>
