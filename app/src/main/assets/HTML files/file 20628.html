<p>I <em>think</em> I understand the problem. You are trying to show the second view in a tab bar and you get the view to appear, but the tab bar is not correct.</p>

<p>The problem is, you need to tell the tab bar to update the view, you don't update it yourself.</p>

<p>To set the selected tab in your tab bar programmatically you should do</p>

<pre><code>-(void)targetMethod:(id)sender {
    // 0 would be the first tab, 1 would be the second
    self.tabBarController.selectedIndex = 1;
}
</code></pre>
