<p>Assuming I understand the question correctly and your want to run whatever code your PHP content has:
You can basically do this using two methods, but <strong>I wouldn't recommend either</strong>:</p>

<p>1) Use <code>eval()</code>. This is a very simple solution but also a very bad idea, and it won't work on many shared servers.</p>

<p>2) Write the content field to an actual PHP file (if it's not in a file already) and get the contents of that file using <code>file_get_contents()</code> or similar. You need to put the URL of the file so you only get the output, and this also won't work on some shared servers.</p>
