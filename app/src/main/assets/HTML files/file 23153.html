  <p>Stock apps (Phone, People, etc) as well as some other apps do this correctly. That is, as soon as I fling to a page, that new page's menu items are displayed. But in mine, they are only displayed at the end of the swiping animation.</p>

<p>I cannot reproduce your behavior with Phone, on a Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.2. There, the action bar does not change until the new page is fully visible, regardless of whether it is a fling or swipe.</p>

<p>With Contacts, I see what you are seeing, in that the action bar changes when the finger lifts up, so on a fling, the change happens faster.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think that you're making a mountain out of a molehill. That being said, the only way I can see to replicate Contacts' behavior is to completely reimplement <code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code>, removing the <code>setMenuVisibility()</code> calls from <code>setPrimaryItem()</code>, then arrange to make those calls at what you feel is a more opportune time.</p>
