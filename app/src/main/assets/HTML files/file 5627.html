<p>I can't know for sure, but I believe it's, because your <code>i</code> variable is <em>global</em>. Always declare a variable that should not be <code>global</code> with a <code>var</code> keyword. For example,</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0; i&lt;allPoints[0].length; i++) {
</code></pre>

<p>I think your application modifies the variable <code>i</code> somewhere else and that is the reason why assigning it to another variable seems to solve your problem. The real solution here is to use a <em>local</em> variable with a <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
