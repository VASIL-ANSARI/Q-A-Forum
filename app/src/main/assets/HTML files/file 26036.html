<p>So the last solution I was investigating ended up being the one I used. Now when I sync appointments I check if they are part of a series and lookup their recurring master and cache that state. Then when I see delete/move events I can lookup my map of master appointment IDs to tell if the action is for a series.</p>

<p>I was hoping to avoid doing all this extra state tracking, but I couldn't find anyway to make the linkage from a delete event to the individual occurrences I have synced without it.</p>
