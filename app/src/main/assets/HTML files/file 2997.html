<p>I just download the .zip file, opened the file and double-clicked the <em>SDK Setup.exe</em> and it loaded fine. A setup window popped up in the background, that does not happen to you at all?</p>

<h3>EDIT:</h3>

<p>Take a look into <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Installing the Android SDK</strong></a> and look over the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/requirements.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>System Requirements</strong></a> and make sure you have both JDK 5 or JDK 6 (<em>which you do</em>) and <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" rel="nofollow"><strong>JRE 6</strong></a></p>
