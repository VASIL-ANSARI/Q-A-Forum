<p>For testing on real hardware you need to use a key different from the debug key. Following your post you are using a debug keystore.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html#getfingerprint" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html#getfingerprint</a></p>

<p>Read that paragraph on google.</p>

<p>Is important that the application is exported as a signed application with the same key used for the google api (and NOT the debug key).</p>

<p>For create a valid read that paragraph:</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html#releasemode" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html#releasemode</a></p>

<p>and then use the same key to obtain the google maps api key.</p>

<p>Once you have the key for your application you can export a signed application by clicking with right button of your mouse on the project select Android Tools and then Export as a signed application package and follow the wizard (probably you can create a new key using that wizard).</p>

<p>hope that help.</p>
