<p>You'll likely be using some variation on MVC for this, and you'll have no choice but to move everything in the model -- the non-GUI logical representation of your program -- that needs moving, but the overhead for this shouldn't be huge. You'll only need to move things in the view -- the GUI portion of your program -- that are within the view's viewport (on the screen), and this will be a very limited subset of the objects on your map.</p>
