<p>I think you may be able to accomplish this using dynamic libraries and loading them at runtime (using <code>dlopen</code> and friends).</p>

<pre><code>void * lib = dlopen("mynewcode.so", RTLD_LAZY);
if(lib) {
    void (*fn)(void) = dlsym(lib, "libfunc");

    if(fn) fn();
    dlclose(lib);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would obviously have to be compiling the new code as you go along, but if you keep replacing <code>mynewcode.so</code> I think this will work for you.</p>
