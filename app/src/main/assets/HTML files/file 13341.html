<p>Given your requirements, I would recommend using <strong>online web services</strong> to push your LateX file and get a compiled PDF in return.</p>

<p>This means you get a full PDF file without any compilation, no installing, <strong>just pure PHP-based</strong> web services and API.</p>

<p>There are a number of online solutions, some are free, so please check the one that fits your need : <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3/compiling-documents-online">Compiling documents online</a></p>

<p>Good luck !</p>
