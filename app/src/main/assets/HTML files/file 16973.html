<p>It seems that the linker is not able to find keyPressEvent implementation.
Have you implemented keyPressEvent() in your Widget class? You will have to do that since your are declaring that in your class definition. Add the following code just to forward the event to baseclass.</p>

<pre><code>void Widget::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent *e){ QWidget::keyPressEvent(e);}
</code></pre>
