<p><code>i++</code> vs <code>++i</code> does not matter in this particular case. While C masters will tell you to store array.length in a variable, modern optimizing compilers make that unnecessary in this case as long as the length does not change in the loop. If you're really concerned you can benchmark both, but since <code>.length</code> doesn't actually need to traverse the entire array each time you'll be OK.</p>
