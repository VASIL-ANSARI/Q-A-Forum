<p>I think you can do it in your template.  I've only used Smarty, so you're gonna have to connect the dots on syntax</p>

<pre><code>[LET nodesLen = nodes.length]
[LET countSoFar = 0]
[foreach array="nodes" as="node"]     --attributes for key? name? could be helpful
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="%prefix%view/%node.id%"]&gt;%node.title%&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
[countSoFar++]
 [if countSoFar &gt;= nodesLen / 2]
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 [/if]
[/foreach] 
</code></pre>

<p>In smarty theres smarty..iteration which would do what I showed with countSoFar automatically.  See what you're template engine is capable of and how you can implement what I sketched above.</p>

<p>I don't think you need prototype or any javascript to do this, and it seems like a problem much more easily handled by tpl</p>
