<p>First Question:  Those are solution folders, which are just a way of logically separating the different parts of the solution (layers, etc.).  You can only have physical folders inside a project (the ones that aren't dotted-lined): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267200/visual-studio-solutions-folder-as-real-folders">Visual Studio Solutions Folder as real Folders</a></p>

<p>Second:  A shared folder could be used for classes that don't neatly fit inside either the BLL or the DAL.  I can't think of a reason off the top of my head for one, but I've seen examples where shared classes are created in RIA services for Silverlight.</p>

<p>Bonus: The tests folder is for holding your Unit Tests.  Look up Unit Testing for ideas.  It is very useful to write Unit Tests for your code to provide a first line of bug-fighting whenever you create (do my tests run successfully on my new code?) or modify (do my tests <strong>still</strong> run successfully on my existing code after this change I just made).  <strong>NUnit</strong> is a popular open-source Unit Test framework, and MS provides its own <strong>Test Project</strong> Unit Test framework built into Visual Studio.</p>
