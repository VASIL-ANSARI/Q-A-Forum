<p>Regarding the order of invocation the JPA 2 spec section 3.5 states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If multiple entity listeners
  are defined, the order in which they are invoked is determined by the order in which they are specified
  in the EntityListeners annotation. The XML descriptor may be used as an alternative to
  specify the invocation order of entity listeners or to override the order specified in metadata annotations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And regarding wether using multiple methods for the same lifecycle event the JPA 2 Spec states in section 3.5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A single class must not have more than one lifecycle callback method for the same lifecycle event. The same method may be used for multiple callback events.</p>
