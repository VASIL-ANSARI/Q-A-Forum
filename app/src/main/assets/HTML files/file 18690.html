<p>Am not sure about the result. But as per my idea below process should work.
You can try replacing in your javascript</p>

<pre><code>$( "#sortable" ).sortable();
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>$( "#sortable .innerElement" ).sortable();    
</code></pre>

<p>Considering, "innerElement" is the class of the required DOM Element to be sorted.<br/>
With this approach, you should be able to make multiple selected elements to be sortable, by applying "innerElement" class.</p>

<p>Hope it works for you :)</p>
