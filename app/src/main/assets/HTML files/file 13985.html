<p>A few times I have found that my phone operator does not allow certain type of files to be accessed. For example it was impossible for me to get an archive file (.zip) from the web in 3G but it worked fine in Wifi.
Maybe your problem is similar. Check your image file type and try with other types of files.</p>
