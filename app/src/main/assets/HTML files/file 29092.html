<p>When I have similar alignment problems, especially when dealing with inline-block elements (not experienced enough to know how closely tables relate to that in terms of similarities), what usually helps me is some combination of:</p>

<ul>
<li>vertical-align: top;</li>
<li>adjusting height:;</li>
<li>adjusting padding-top:; or more commonly, margin-top:; to re-align images from there</li>
</ul>

<p>AKA: Instead of v-aligning center, v-align from top and use padding/margin to position from there. Hope this helps some.</p>
