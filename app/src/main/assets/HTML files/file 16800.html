<p>It's a simple solution, but are you running the mediaplayer part of the code in a Service?
If you are not, that is the problem. </p>

<p>See <a href="http://marakana.com/forums/android/examples/60.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> for more about services. Also the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html" rel="nofollow">Android docs about services</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html#mpandservices" rel="nofollow">the official Android documentation</a> for more about running media from a service (while your application is paused, screen is off, etc.)</p>
