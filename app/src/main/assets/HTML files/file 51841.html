<p><em>After some time, the solution:</em></p>

<p>If you open the SVG in a text editor, the first part will have something like:</p>

<pre><code>viewBox="0 0 190 70"
</code></pre>

<p>If you add <code>width="190</code> and <code>height="70"</code> after it, the problem will disappear. This will create some small difficulties when you want to resize, but the mayor problem is solved.</p>
