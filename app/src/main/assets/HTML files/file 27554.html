<p>I figured out the problem by reinstalling the homebrew installation of PySide.</p>

<p>When you install using homebrew, you get a warning that </p>

<pre><code>For non-homebrew python (2.x), you need to amend your PYTHONPATH like so:
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH 
</code></pre>

<p>Ran this and the module worked.</p>

<p>To make the change automatic rather than having to type the line each time I opened a new terminal console, I needed to add that line to my ./bash_profile file.</p>
