<p>It's actually easier than you think, change your onClick method, which I assume you're setting by xml to <code>PridejDalsiStaniceniClicked</code> to this:</p>

<pre><code>int[] views = new int[]{R.id.Radek_2,R.id.Radek_3,R.id.Radek_4};//...
int counter = 0;
public void PridejDalsiStaniceniClicked(View v)
{
    findViewById(views[counter]).setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    if(counter&lt;views.length){
        counter++;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What happens inside is that we will fetch the view that matches the counter of times pressed while there are still views in the array. <strong>Some people don't realize that view ids are integers</strong> and can be stored in an array like in the example.</p>
