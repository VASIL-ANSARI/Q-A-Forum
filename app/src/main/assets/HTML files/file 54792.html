<p>Thanks for your comments, Remy. They shook me out of a "tizzy" I'd got myself into whilst trying to solve the problem. I'd forgotten that Windows needs to move memory blocks around, and can't do this if locked them.</p>

<p>The initial problem of the Synchronize(update) call (code block 1 above) was caused by my still having the working copy (Imgcopy) locked (from inside the thread) during the call, preventing the main Form from subsequently accessing it. I suspect (but haven't investigated- <em>that</em> code has gone) the same root cause was at work in code block 2.</p>

<p>Locking every bitmap just prior to access, and unlocking immediately afterwards has solved this problem.</p>

<p>Peter O, thanks for your edit- I didn't realise there was so much overhead in my initial post. </p>
