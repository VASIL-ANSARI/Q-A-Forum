<p>Forget about doing it by code I would say. Create an Animation via Animator component.</p>

<p>The Animation window allows to use Animation event.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/animeditor-AnimationEvents.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/animeditor-AnimationEvents.html</a></p>

<p>If you really want to keep the code, then you would use an event system that uses a integer flag. Your panel controller would listen to the animation and when one is done it triggers the event. Panel listens and records it. Then when all three are done, it does what should be</p>

<pre><code>public class PanelCtrl : MonoBehaviour {

    public static event Action OnCompletion;
    void Update () {
    if (moving){
        distCovered = (Time.time - startTime) * moveSpeed * 4;

        fracJourney = distCovered / journeyLength;

        transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(startMarker, endMarker,fracJourney);

        if (fracJourney &gt;= 1){
            moving = false;
            OnCompletion();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have a controller to listen:</p>

<pre><code>public class Manager:MonoBehaviour {
    void Awake(){
        PanelCtrl.OnCompletion += HandleCompletion;
    }
}

private int flag = 3 
void HandleCompletion (){
     if(--flag == 0){ Debug.Log("All done"); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would clearly consider that way to be dirty but it should work and requires less modification from your existing code. </p>
