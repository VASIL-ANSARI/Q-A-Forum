<p>The event object is passed by the browser to event handlers when an event occurs in order so you can query different information about the event ( such as x/y position, key clicked, etc ). </p>

<p>Note: It can be named anything, so if you change <code>function(event)</code> to <code>function(lol)</code> and reference it with <code>lol</code> it would work the same way.</p>
