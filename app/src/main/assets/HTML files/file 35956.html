<p>Your php_error_log tells:</p>

<pre><code>php_error_log [15-Apr-2014 11:25:08 America/Los_Angeles] PHP Warning: PHP Startup: PDFlib: Unable to initialize module
Module compiled with build ID=API20121212,TS
PHP compiled with build ID=API20121212,NTS
These options need to match
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the PHP you are using is compiled "non thread safe", the PDFlib module you use is the "thread safe" variant. In a "non thread safe" php you can only use "non thread safe extensions. Sou you need to install the extension from the "php-550-nozts_VS11" directory of the PDFlib package.</p>
