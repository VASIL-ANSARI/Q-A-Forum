<p>It seems that this bug is fixed in the current source version, also the bug is still marked as new.
The the patch which fixed this bug imho:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/whosaysni/elaphe/commits/19dd8f58c76ac75914e3e4d8ae7db1b9489cbcb8?at=develop" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/whosaysni/elaphe/commits/19dd8f58c76ac75914e3e4d8ae7db1b9489cbcb8?at=develop</a></p>

<p>This patch is from the 2014-10-22, the current version elaphe 0.6.0 on pypi is from 2013-12-05. If you installed via pip you have the buggy version.</p>

<p>There is a python3 enabled fork of this project <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elaphe3" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elaphe3</a>, which was uploaded on the 2016-05-25. So this fork might contain the necessary bugfix. You could remove elaphe and install elaphe3.</p>

<p>However, considering that elaphe (at least the non 3 version) looks pretty abandoned and has GhostScript and PIL as dependencies I would look for another solution. </p>
