<p>I can't speak for an "official" right place, but I have a custom base Controller which all of my controllers extend. I place my global <code>registerCssFile()</code> calls in the <code>init()</code> method of this base controller, so they are automatically registered on the whole site.</p>

<p>If you are re-using partial view files a lot I could see registering the CSS <em>in</em> the view I guess <em>but</em>...</p>

<p>It probably makes the most sense to just included all the CSS for the whole site in the <code>init()</code> controller method, and <em>then combine and compress it using <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/extensions/?tag=compress" rel="nofollow">extensions like these</a></em>. </p>

<p>(Unless one view has a LOT of custom CSS not used anywhere else on the site, maybe.)</p>

<p>EDIT: As mentioned below by briiC.lv, using <code>themes</code> means you'll want to keep all CSS in your view/layout files, separate from the Controller code.</p>
