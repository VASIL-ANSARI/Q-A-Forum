<p>According to your source, <code>Led</code>, <code>Thermometer</code>, <code>Memory</code> have to be default constructible, means they should have a default constructor, but they haven't.</p>

<p>You could use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initializer_list" rel="nofollow">member initializer list</a> here:</p>

<pre><code>Luminary::Luminary(Led led,Thermometer thermometer,Memory memory) 
    : _led(led), _thermometer(thermometer), _memory(memory) {}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#init-lists" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a discussion about why in moust cases, you should use initialization lists rather than assignment. </p>
