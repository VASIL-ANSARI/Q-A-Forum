<p>It should be:</p>

<pre><code>void Set_Pin(double pin) {
  this-&gt;pin = pin;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also this should not be needed, but due the same naming with the function parameter it would be wise to use it indeed, more clear for the user.</p>

<p>Also regarding style. I would use start class name with a capital letter. </p>
