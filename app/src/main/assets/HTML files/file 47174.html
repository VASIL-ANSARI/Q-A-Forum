<p>Have you analyzed your queries with <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/using-explain.html" rel="nofollow">explain plans</a>? You may be able to find a query that will return the result set you wish that isn't as heavy a load on the query engine. Remember to only select the columns you actually need (try to avoid SELECT *), well planned indexing and to use inner/outer joins in favour of a huge list of WHERE clause filters.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
