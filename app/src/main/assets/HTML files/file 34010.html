<p>NSBox has a 'Custom' type but not sure whether such look can be achieved with one property.
The best I can make is to have NSBox inside NSBox. Additionally use labels and Horizontal lines to achieve the look. </p>

<p>The outer box can be of type: Primary, Border Type: Line. 
Inside Box Type: Custom, Border Type: None, Fill color : match the look.</p>

<p>You can tweak a bit to achieve the look and feel of the attached image.</p>
