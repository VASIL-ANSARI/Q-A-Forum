<p>The reason is, you are having a form in your <code>holidays/show.html.erb</code> but not in your <code>holidays/new.html.erb</code>.</p>

<p>According to rails convention, if form is submitted in <strong>new.html.erb</strong>, then by default the <strong>POST</strong> method is called of that particular controller.</p>

<p>But since your file is <code>show.html.erb</code>, you have to explicitly define your <strong>POST</strong> method in the <code>form_for</code>.</p>

<pre><code>form_for @holiday , :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; :create }, :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; "post"} do |f|
</code></pre>
