<p>By default, the Razor engine only looks for <code>.cshtml</code> and <code>.vbhtml</code> files. You can change this behavior by defining a custom ViewEngine inheriting from <code>RazorViewEngine</code> and adding locations to search for views.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6049445/make-asp-net-mvc-3-razor-view-engine-ignore-vbhtml-files">Make ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor View Engine ignore .vbhtml files</a>:</p>

<p>Then register it in your <code>Application_Start()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ViewEngines.Engines.Clear();
ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new CSRazorViewEngine());
