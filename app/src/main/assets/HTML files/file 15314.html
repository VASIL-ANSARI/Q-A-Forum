<p>You will need to define something that is serializable. <code>System.Drawing.Image</code> is, but not in the cotnext of WCF (using DataContractSerializer) by default. That could range from returning the raw bytes as an array, or serialization to a string (base64, JSON) or implementing a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733127.aspx" rel="nofollow">DataContract</a> that is serializable and can carry the data with it. </p>

<p>As others have said, WCF supports streaming, but that's not the crux of the issue here. Depending on the size of the data you might wish to do this, and doing so will reduce the problem in itself since you would be streaming bytes (from an evident, top-level view).</p>
