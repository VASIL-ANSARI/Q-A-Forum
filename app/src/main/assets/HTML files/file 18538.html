<p>AS you have said, you are setting the timezone to America/Chicago. When you call strtotime you are explicitly specifying GMT in the string. When you then put the timestamp into Date, it is taking the timestamp and giving you the time in America/Chicago, 5 hours before GMT, which is why it is 00:00AM.</p>

<p>You are using 5.3. I would suggest using the <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php" rel="nofollow">DateTime</a> object instead of strtotime() and date(). Its a bit easier to work with timezones etc, and the var_dumps are useful. Create a DateTime from user input or db value and then pass that around in your code instead of timestamps. </p>
