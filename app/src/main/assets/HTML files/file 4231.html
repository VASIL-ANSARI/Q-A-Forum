<p>Inside xml (as a text value) it is <em>correct</em> for <code>&lt;</code> to be encoded as <code>&amp;lt;</code>. The internal representation of xml doesn't affect the value, so let it get encoded. You <em>can</em> get around this by forcing a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_cdata.asp">CDATA section</a>, but in all honesty - it isn't worth it. But here is an example using CDATA:</p>

<pre><code>string noEncoding = new XElement("foo", new XCData("a &lt; b")).ToString();
</code></pre>
