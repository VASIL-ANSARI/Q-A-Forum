<ul>
<li><p>First solution: What about a pre-building stage for a makefile (if you're using it) ?</p>

<pre><code>CC=gcc

all: pre-build main-build

pre-build:
    @echo PRE

main-build: target

target: $(OBJS) 
      $(CC) -o ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Second solution: if you're using something else like <strong>CMake</strong> to generate your makefile then you might use CMake's APIs to do pre-build operations and/or to extend your makefile.</p></li>
<li><p>Third solution: do it via <strong>shell script</strong>, something like sed also supports regex so you should be set for a pretty decent parser.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth solution: use a <strong>python</strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3253522/1938163">script</a> invoked before compilation stage. This is probably overkill but should indeed suffice for any parsing need.</p></li>
</ul>
