<p>Just took a short look at your code.. I think</p>

<pre><code>tries = tries + 1; // Adds one to the tries counter
</code></pre>

<p>is in the wrong scope</p>

<pre><code>while ((choice != 1) || (choice != 1) || (choice != 1));   
   cout &lt;&lt; "Try to solve the problem!\n"; // Provides instruction to the user.

   while ((result != guess) &amp;&amp; (tries &lt; maxtries))
   {
   }  
   tries = tries + 1; // Adds one to the tries counter
}
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>while (choice != 1);   
   cout &lt;&lt; "Try to solve the problem!\n"; // Provides instruction to the user.

   while ((result != guess) &amp;&amp; (tries &lt; maxtries))
   {
          tries = tries + 1; // Adds one to the tries counter
   }  
}
</code></pre>
