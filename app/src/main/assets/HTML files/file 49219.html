<p>Seems like you are invoking the android driver incorrectly. Please use the following code to initiate an Android driver.</p>

<pre><code>AppiumDriver driver;
driver = new AndroidDriver(new URL("http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub"), capabilities);
</code></pre>

<p>You will be needing Selenium server, appium java client jar file in your classpath. </p>
