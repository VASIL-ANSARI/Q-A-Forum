<p>Do you absolutely need to encrypt using python? Depending on your PHP version you could do this for PHP >= 5.3:</p>

<pre><code>openssl_digest("Pa55w0rd!"."$6$x88yEvVg", "sha512");
</code></pre>

<p>and this for PHP 5.2 or 5.1</p>

<pre><code>hash("sha512", "Pa55w0rd!"."$6$x88yEvVg");
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that your salt value is just being concatenated with your password value.</p>
