<p>If every even/odd pair is a line, then replace 'inited==NO' with a counter and use 'counter%2 == 0' so that for even numbered points it moves to where you want to be and for odd numbered points it connects the previous point. It may be easier to not use fast enumeration but an old fashioned for loop instead.</p>

<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; [arr count]; ++i) {
        CGPointObject *thePt = [arr objectAtIndex:i];                    
        if (i%2 == 0)
            CGPathMoveToPoint(aPath, NULL, [thePt.x floatValue],  [thePt.y floatValue]);
        else
            CGPathAddLineToPoint(aPath, NULL, [thePt.x floatValue], [thePt.y floatValue]); 
    }
</code></pre>
