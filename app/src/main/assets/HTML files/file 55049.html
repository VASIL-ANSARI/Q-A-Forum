<p>The browser that Playstation use might not support viewport units. The viewport units are gaining support on all modern browsers, however, there are some cases where this unit is not supported or bugs have been found.</p>

<p>Try setting the html and body tag's height to 100%. Then set your "blog-post-featured-banner" height to 50%. This should replicate what you are trying to achieve currently.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="blog-post-featured-banner"&gt;
     &lt;img width="1600" height="900" src="#"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

html, body {
    height: 100%
}

.blog-post-featured-banner {
    height: 50%;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    position: relative;
}
.blog-post-featured-banner img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
</code></pre>
