<p>This may not answer your OCR question, but one last method you can try is hook windows' DrawText API. I recently learned about this to solve a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12570167/getting-the-text-from-a-dialog-box-that-does-not-use-a-label-control/12609875">similar problem like you had myself</a>.</p>

<p>Go download the <a href="http://easyhook.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">EasyHook</a> library and look at the examples. Try hooking <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd162498%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DrawTextA, DrawTextW</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd162499%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DrawTextExA and DrawTextExW</a> on the external app (It will be different code than I had in my question because I was hooking a Inproc DLL, not a external program, but your use case is what EasyHook was designed to do, my way was a hack). Find out what it uses and see if you can get your code to parse the text out.</p>
