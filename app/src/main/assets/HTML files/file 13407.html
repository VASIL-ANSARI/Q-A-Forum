<p>I've recently been playing with Twitter4j and had some problems that sound similar to those you are experiencing. I can't see anything wrong in the code you've posted, but I wonder what the callback URL you're passing to getOauthRequestToken is?  I had some issues with this myself. I think your CALLBACKURL needs to be set to "snapp://twitter". Note that you need the colon.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, I suggest you try removing the android:host from the manifest line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;data android:scheme="snapp" android:host="twitter" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so you're left with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;data android:scheme="snapp" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then in the code where you make the call to getOauthRequestToken, pass the value "snapp:///".  This was basically what I did to first get it working.</p>

<p>If this then works, you could try experimenting with putting the android:host="twitter" back and then changing the value passed to getOauthRequestToken.</p>

<p>If this doesn't work, have you seen if the onNewIntent is called at all - i.e. is it just not passing the uri.toString().startsWith(CALLBACKURL) test as your toast is only displayed if that passes?  You could try putting some logging in or add a break point in the debugger.</p>
