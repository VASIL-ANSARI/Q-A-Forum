<p>I think at the moment you are looking at Dates that are empty in certain parts of the cube space - try forcing to <code>nonempty</code> by using a measure from the <code>FactPatientDr</code> </p>

<pre><code>WITH 
  MEMBER [Measures].[Max key] AS 
    Max
    (
      nonempty(
        [DimAnchorDate].[Date Key].MEMBERS
        ,[Measures].[SomeMeasureInFactPatientDr]
      )
     ,[DimAnchorDate].[Date Key].CurrentMember.Member_Key
    ) 
SELECT 
  {
    [Measures].[Max key]
  } ON COLUMNS
FROM X;
</code></pre>
