<p>This is not a problem with your server, this is a problem with your client.</p>

<p>Your client is submitting an <code>ISO-8859-1</code> string, you may try to <code>utf8_encode()</code> the data prior to submitting it.</p>

<p>If you still see weird chars when both the client and the server use the same encoding, then you might have a source string mixing several encodings. Is it built from a single source? Is it being displayed correctly somewhere?</p>
