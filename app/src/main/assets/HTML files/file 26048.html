<p>You can make credit card payments via the new <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/" rel="nofollow">PayPal REST API</a>.  Depending on your use case check the documentation for sale (directly charging a card), or authorize and capture.  You also have the option of storing cards in the vault for later use.</p>
