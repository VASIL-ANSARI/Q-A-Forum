<p>Assuming you want to allow at most <strong><em>1</em></strong> reference to either <code>employee</code> or <code>product</code>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE picture (
  picture_id serial PRIMARY KEY
, picture text NOT NULL
, employee_id int REFERENCES employee
, product_id int REFERENCES product
, CONSTRAINT employee_xor_picture
       CHECK (employee_id IS NULL OR product_id IS NULL)
);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>employee_id</code> and <code>product_id</code> each <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK" rel="nofollow">reference</a> the PK of the respective tables and can be NULL.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS" rel="nofollow">CHECK constraint</a> <code>employee_xor_picture</code> enforces that at least one of both stays NULL at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p>It does <em>not</em> enforce that one of both is <code>NOT NULL</code> - it's typically more convenient to allow pictures that are not yet assigned, but that really depends on your requirements. To enforce that, too: </p>

<pre><code>    CHECK (employee_id IS NULL AND product_id  IS NOT NULL OR
           product_id  IS NULL AND employee_id IS NOT NULL)
</code></pre>
