<p>I would asume that the issue comes from the \0 which is expected when using a C# string with p/invoke.<br>
I have no experience with Btrieve, but it is pretty likely there is no \0.<br>
Could you post the original c structure? Otherwise you need to use a byte array with a fixed length of 15 and convert it into a string afterwards.<br>
Furthermore I would use the sizeof operator to compare the size of the structure on both ends.</p>
