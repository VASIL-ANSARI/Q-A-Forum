<p>The reason that your code prints an extra newline is because in the last iteration of the <code>names_in</code> function, the variable <code>names</code> is ``, which gets appended to the end of <code>names_list</code>, causing the <code>print_names</code> function to run <code>print ''</code> at the end, which prints an extra newline.</p>
