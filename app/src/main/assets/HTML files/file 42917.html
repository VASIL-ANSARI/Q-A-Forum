<p>You need to make sure your container div is the right size for your inner div - at the moment it is too small so your inner div isn't showing the margin.  If you remove the margin from <code>.tl-box</code> and then add the following styles (makes the outer box the correct width for it's contents and adds the margin to it), it should fix your issue:</p>

<pre><code>.slide .col-lg-2 {
    width:239px;
    margin:13.5px; 
}
</code></pre>
