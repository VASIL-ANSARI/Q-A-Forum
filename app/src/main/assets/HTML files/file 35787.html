<p>Use a QTextDocument and set your content in HTML mode. Take a look at QPintPreviewDialog. This is the way to go. You also could use a QPageSetupDialog before the print preview if you want to ajust the page settings. Three small advices: 1) If an answer is acceptable, mark it as accepted and upvote. 2) Just ask one question per thread. 3) Read the Qt API. It takes some time but you have at least to know the modules and classes to look for if you have a problem.</p>
