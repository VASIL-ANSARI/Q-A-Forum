<p>So I guess you have 3 options.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>is to run the task in another process.  See something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3711040/get-java-runtime-process-running-in-background">Get Java Runtime Process running in background</a>.  I don't know of a framework that would help with this.  There aren't too many lines of code this framework would be saving you.</p></li>
<li><p>Run in another thread on the same JVM.  See below.</p></li>
<li><p>Run in another process on another server.  You are going to have to write the client/server or use a web framework or <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136424.html" rel="nofollow">RMI</a> to do the remoting.  I don't know of any framework that will do this for you automatically.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In terms of running it in the same JVM, I'd not use a framework at all.  I'd just run the task in a loop with proper exception handling:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; retries; i++) {
   try {
      doTask();
   } catch (Throwable t) {
      // log the throwable here
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a framework would just be too complicated.  If the task runs out of memory then running it in another thread would not help and you will have to spawn another process to handle the task.</p>

<p>If you needed it to run in the background then @assyliaas' initial answer about using thread-pool is the right way to go.</p>
