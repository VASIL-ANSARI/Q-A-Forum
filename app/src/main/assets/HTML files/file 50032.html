<p>When you create instance of object using <code>new ...()</code>, it's no longer a Spring managed bean - hence you lose all functionallity added by Spring, i.e. aspects (in your case - <code>@Cacheable</code>), transactions etc.</p>

<p>Basically, what Spring does is it creates a proxy for you object, which processes all the calls to the interface methods, adding extra logic depending on the annotations and aspects present. When you manually create instance of your object, no proxy is created, and all calls go directly into your object's methods.</p>
