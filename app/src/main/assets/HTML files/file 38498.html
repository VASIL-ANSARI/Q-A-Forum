<p>The reason is when you perform the upload your dealing with the request as binary, which invalidates the <code>Request.Form</code> collection (same as if you call <code>Request.BinaryRead()</code>. To counter this the ASPUpload component provides a <a href="http://www.aspupload.com/object_upload.html#Form" rel="nofollow"><code>Form</code> Collection</a> of it's own which contains the posted form values.</p>

<p>Changing the values <code>Request.Form</code> to <code>Upload.Form</code> should fix the problem in this case.</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Set Upload = Server.CreateObject("Persits.Upload")
Upload.OverwriteFiles = False
Upload.Save Server.MapPath("files/drawings/")

'Also make sure the string concatenation is correct (had extra " in after "values")
sql = "Insert into Name(first,last) values ('" &amp; Upload.Form("firstname") &amp; "','" &amp; Upload.Form("lastname") &amp; "' " )
ADOConn.Execute sql
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>On a side note:</strong></p>
  
  <p>This information isn't hard to find the ASPUpload <a href="http://www.aspupload.com/objectreference.html" rel="nofollow">Object Reference</a> and <a href="http://www.aspupload.com/manual.html" rel="nofollow">Online User Manual</a> are very good. In fact if you had looked at the <a href="http://www.aspupload.com/manual_simple.html#2_2" rel="nofollow">Section 2.2 - FILES and FORM Collections</a> you would have had the answer to your question without posting here.</p>
  
  <p>Personal experience has taught me that when dealing with 3rd Party COM Components 9/10 times the supporting documentation is very good, especially so in the case of <a href="http://www.persits.com/" rel="nofollow">Persits Software</a> components.</p>
