<p>You could have a colours.css file with just the colours/images for each tag in.
Then you can change the colours just by replacing the file, or having a dynamically generated CSS file, or having different CSS files available and selecting based upon website URL/subfolder/property/etc.</p>

<p>Or you can have colour tags as you write, but then your HTML turns into:</p>

<p>&lt;p style="body grey"&gt;Blah&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>CSS should have a feature where you can define values for things like colours that you wish to be consistent through a style but are defined in one place only. Still, there's search and replace.</p>
