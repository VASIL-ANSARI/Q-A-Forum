<p>I guess this condition is <code>true</code> and your list gets resetted:</p>

<pre><code>//Update the minimums.
if (costOfBSSF &lt; minCostOfBSSF)
{
    minCostOfBSSF = costOfBSSF;
    minRandomCityOrder = new List&lt;int&gt;(randomCityOrder);
}
</code></pre>

<p>it does not mean that you are initializing the list with <code>randomCityOrder</code>-number of items but that the list has this initial capacity. If you want to have that number of items you might try:</p>

<pre><code>minRandomCityOrder = Enumerable.Range(0, randomCityOrder).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>...but I don't know if it makes sense in your algorithm. I'm just showing what's possible.</p>
