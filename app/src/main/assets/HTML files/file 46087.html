<p>Just because your users don't log in, doesn't mean you can't log them in behind the scenes. You can use the Parse SDK and its <code>PFUser.currentUser</code>. If the current user is <code>nil</code>, create one by signing up a new user (this creates a new user in Parse's database and logs the user in on the device). Now that device can reference the current user's creation date for anything time-dependent.</p>
