<p>I don't think you have to worry.  The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> is clear that column aliases are not case sensitive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Column, index, stored routine, and event names are not case sensitive
  on any platform, nor are column aliases.</p>
  
  <p>. . .</p>
  
  <p>By default, table aliases are case sensitive on Unix, but not so on
  Windows or OS X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to speculate why the case sensitivity follows the default case sensitivity of the underlying operating system, I would guess that under some circumstances (particularly long ago when MySQL was being developed), tables are stored in files under their own names.  Now it is controlled by the <code>lower_case_table_names</code> system variable, which simply has different defaults on different operating systems.</p>
