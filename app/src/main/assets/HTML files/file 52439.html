<p>Your ProgressBar is in the layout content_progress. But you are replacing that layout with your TableLayout and with that the previous view is being overwritten.</p>

<p>What you can try is to predefine the TableLayout and ProgressBar in an XML and set it as a the content view, or define a RelativeLayout programmatically and add both TableLayout and ProgressBar as views</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18302232/centering-progressbar-programmatically-in-android">this answer</a> where it has been given how to add a progressBar programmatically. You can implement a similar method for the TableLayout also.</p>
