<p>If your class has a default constructor (and you want to default construct the instances), you can use an array <code>new</code> i.e. <code>new ClassName[some_number]</code> - which is of type <code>ClassName*</code>).</p>

<p>If it doesn't have a default constructor, you can fool around with placement <code>new</code>, or use an array of pointers and <code>new</code> each one manually.</p>
