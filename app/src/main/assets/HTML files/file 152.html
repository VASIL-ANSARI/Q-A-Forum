<p>I've not used the Android Emulator but I have set the $http_proxy environment variable for perl and wget and a few cygwin tools on windows. That might work for you for android, but the slash in the domain name seems like a potential problem.
I know I tried having my domain "GLOBAL" in there, but ended up taking it out and sticking with: <code>http://$USER:password@www-proxy.company.com:80</code></p>

<p>One problem I run into a lot though is programs that cannot be told to use the proxy for DNS queries too. In cases where they don't I always get a host name not found. I'd like to find a local dns resolver that can use the proxy for all the programs that won't.</p>
