<p>I can't seem to reproduce this error although using the same input as you did. Maybe you have a <code>newline</code> character before the input you have specified?<br>
Try running this code using <code>python prog.py</code> in your terminal.</p>

<p><code>EOF error</code> is expected if no data is given when calling <code>input</code> or <code>raw_input</code> as explained in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.EOFError" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Also, it's advisable to use <code>raw_input</code> and not <code>input</code> when getting input from the user on <code>python 2</code>, it's not going to fix your error though.</p>
