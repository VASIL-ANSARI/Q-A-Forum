<p>While it's possible with some databases (like SQL Server post 2005) to write recursive queries, I don't believe those get generated by LINQ.  On the other hand, if the number of records is sufficiently small, you could materialize the data (to a list) and write a LINQ query that uses a recursive function to generate your list.  </p>

<p>This is from memory, but it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;int?,IEnumerable&lt;data&gt;&gt; f = null;
f = parentId =&gt; {
    IEnumerable&lt;data&gt; result = from data in mydb.datatable
                               where data.ParentId = parentId
                               select data;
    return result.ToList().SelectMany(d=&gt;f(d.Id));
};
</code></pre>

<p>That should get you the hierarchy.</p>
