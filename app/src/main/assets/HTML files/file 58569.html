<p>Observer initialization does not belong in <code>@IBAction</code> handlers.</p>

<p>Once they are set, they remain valid throughout the lifetime of the parent <code>UIViewController</code>, or perhaps the lifetime of the entire App -- check documentation. So you have many observers registered to the event, all duplicates -- an additional duplicate every time the button is clicked.</p>

<p>Observers should be set up at <code>viewDidLoad()</code> and removed at <code>deinit</code>, or conversely at <code>viewWillAppear</code> and removed at <code>viewDidDisappear</code>.</p>

<p>An aside your identifier names are totally cryptic, almost as if they were chosen to deliberately obfuscate. This slows down your own mental processes as well as everyone who sees your code or tries to help.</p>
