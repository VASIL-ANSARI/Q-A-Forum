<p>Most likely the problem is that input is hit testing to your tagvisualization (you didnt show us the code for that).  Remember that "Transparent" <em>is</em> hit tested (use Background=null or IsHitTestVisible=false to make something not hit test)</p>

<p>You can confirm it's not a hardware/platform problem by running the Input Visualizer tool.</p>
