<p>I got the solution on reddit.
This solved it:</p>

<pre><code>bool init_SDL(SDL_Window *&amp;window, SDL_Surface *&amp;windowSurface)
</code></pre>

<p>I needed to pass the pointers by reference, because the pointers itself get manipulated in the functions. Otherwise they would still point to null in main.</p>
