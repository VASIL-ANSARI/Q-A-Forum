<p>One way to do threads is with is with <code>performSelectorInBackground</code>. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>[myObj performSelectorInBackground:@selector(doSomething) withObject:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>You should note, however, that Apple is pretty strongly recommending that you use higher-level concepts like <code>NSOperation</code>s and Dispatch Queues instead of explicitly spawning threads.
