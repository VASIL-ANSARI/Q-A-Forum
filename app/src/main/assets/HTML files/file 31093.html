<p>That's because the color is not returned in that specific format.</p>

<p>I tried this in Firefox, IE and Chome, and it works there:</p>

<pre><code>if (document.getElementById('girl1').style.backgroundColor == 'rgb(101, 189, 119)'){
  alert("true");
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, you should try to find a different way to check whatever it is that you are looking for, as the CSS format returned might not be the same in every current and future browser. You could for example use a class instead of setting the style directly on the element, that is easier to check for reliably.</p>
