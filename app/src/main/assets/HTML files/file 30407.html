<p>mriccelli75, just change a few things to fix the design, such as the removal of <code>text-align: center</code> and reduce the <code>padding</code> value on <code>.subMenu</code>. The <em>functionality</em> works, however, I would strongly advise changing the overall design (such as removing <code>list-style</code>, adding a grid-like system, or at least some way to make it "neater"). See here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/GaQFa/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/GaQFa/1/</a> I'm not going to design the whole thing for you, but it gets you started as far as actual usability goes.</p>
