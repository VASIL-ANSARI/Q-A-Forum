<p>Oficially, I'm a moron. Answer is: I didn't set up <code>Category</code> filter in <code>IntentFilter</code> and this is why I received zero properly sent intents from my class. So, long story short, to "fix" this mistake all one needs to do is add:</p>

<pre><code>filter.addCategory("com.testpackage.test.TEST_CATEGORY");
</code></pre>

<p>and that's it. Thank you for your attention.</p>
