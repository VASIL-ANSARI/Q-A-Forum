<p>Haven't seen that error before. Looks like something in ASP.NET. In any case trying to render 4044 zip code polygons with 200 coordinates each won't work. That's simply too much data for JavaScript to handle. That would create a lot of DOM objects and is also a ton of data to reproject every time the map moves. It would also be a fairly large download for the user (guessing more than 9MB in size). </p>

<p>That said it is possible to visualize millions of polygons on Bing Maps with the right architecture. The trick is to turn your data into tiles (bunch of images). This way the browser only has to handle a few images at a time. This significantly reduce the amount of data the user would have to download. Here is a demo I made that rendered 175,000 polygons that have upwards of 200 coordinates each: <a href="http://onsbingmapsdemo.cloudapp.net/" rel="nofollow">http://onsbingmapsdemo.cloudapp.net/</a> In this sample, drag the pushpin over a polygon to retrieve some info about it. I could have alternatively just used a mouse click, but I wanted to try something different in this app. </p>

<p>There are a couple ways to generate these tile layers. There is an open source MVC app here: <a href="http://ajaxmapdataconnector.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ajaxmapdataconnector.codeplex.com/</a> </p>

<p>I also have a white paper that isn't yet published that goes through how to do this. If you email me at ricky_brundritt at Hotmail.com, I'll send you a copy of the paper and code samples. </p>
