<p>There are several ways you can approach this.</p>

<p>There is an image column type for the DataGridView, the DataGridViewImageColumn, which has an image property that you can pass a bitmap to.</p>

<p>Something like the following should work:</p>

<pre><code>private void createGraphicsColumn(Bitmap image)
{
    DataGridViewImageColumn imageColumn = new DataGridViewImageColumn();
    imageColumn.Image = image;
    imageColumn.Name = "Tree";
    imageColumn.HeaderText = "Nice tree";
    dataGridView1.Columns.Insert(2, imageColumn);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set the Value property of individual cells in this column if needed.</p>

<p>The example above plus a whole lot of other discussion can be found on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2ab8kd75.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another option is to add your image into the datatable - this will automatically generate your image column, but the new column in the datatable needs to be of type byte array.</p>

<p>I found the following code to do this with a quick google:</p>

<pre><code>public byte[] imageToByteArray(System.Drawing.Image imageIn)
{
    MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
    imageIn.Save(ms,System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Gif);
    return  ms.ToArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do take this approach I'd suggest doing a little research to find the best method of creating the byte array - I couldn't vouch for that code being the best.</p>
