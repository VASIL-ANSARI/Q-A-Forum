<p>It seems to be a regression in Chrome 44. I've already pointed on <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/2370" rel="nofollow">an issue in <em>Protractor</em> bug tracker</a> in comments. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1159" rel="nofollow">Here is an issue in <em>chromedriver</em> bug tracker</a>, which describes the same behavior. In some cases not only TAB, but also ENTER and SPACE keys started failing. </p>

<p>Reading comments of these issues brings to a conclusion that there were changes in Chromium sources in how input events are being handled (<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e20f50c297917306f1f438a58ae29e94fb7bc912%5E%21/#F0" rel="nofollow">possible breaking diff</a>).</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=513768" rel="nofollow">an issue in <em>Chromium</em> bug tracker</a> aboit it, developers say that it has already been fixed, but it will take some time to get this fix into stable release of Chrome. If you are in a hurry, you should downgrade Chrome to a version <strong>below</strong> 44.0.2358.0 (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1159#c5" rel="nofollow">source</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've recently got an update and TAB key is working again in Chrome 44.0.2403.130.</p>
