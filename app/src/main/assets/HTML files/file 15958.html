<p>A "very large sparse lazy array"? Sounds like you need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" rel="nofollow">hash table</a>.</p>

<p>From your <code>point_cache_fetch</code> function prototype and all through your question, I am confused about whether your cached values are doubles or immutable arrays.</p>

<p>I'm not going to provide an implementation, as this is not a 'coding challenge' website. You should try to find and reuse existing libraries of threadsafe hashtables and compare their performance for your specific needs.</p>
