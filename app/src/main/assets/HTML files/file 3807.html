<p>If this is Windows Forms, then I would recommend using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource.aspx" rel="nofollow">BindingSource</a> - then you only have to set the databindings once and update the BindingSource's DataSource property when you load a new object.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingmanagerbase.aspx" rel="nofollow">BindingManagerBase</a> is something else - it's for when you have two controls bound to the same data source.)</p>

<p>Your steps would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create BindingSource</li>
<li>Assign an empty object</li>
<li>Create DataBindings between the controls to the BindingSource</li>
<li>Assign objects to the BindingSource's DataSource property as required.</li>
</ol>
