<p>You can create a Bitmap that is the size you want the ring to be and then create a Canvas the same size.  Call <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#setBitmap%28android.graphics.Bitmap%29" rel="nofollow"><code>setBitmap()</code></a> on the Canvas and it will draw on to that for you.  Then you can build your circle and have a bitmap to hold onto and use just like any other resource.</p>
