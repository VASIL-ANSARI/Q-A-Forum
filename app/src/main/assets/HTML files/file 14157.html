  <p>Can somebody please point me towards something that shows how to initiate the service, set up a broadcast receiver, and then pull data out of the receiver into my activity.</p>

<p>Your question title does not seem to match this request. Be that as it may...</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus/tree/master/Service/Downloader" rel="nofollow">This sample project</a> has an activity that sends a command to a service, with the service delivering results via a broadcast <code>Intent</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just need to see how you get data out of broadcasts from services into the activity your service is bound to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would you need a broadcast if you are using the binding pattern? You can pass in some sort of listener object from the activity to the service, which the service can call when events occur. Personally, I dislike the binding pattern and avoid it where possible.</p>
