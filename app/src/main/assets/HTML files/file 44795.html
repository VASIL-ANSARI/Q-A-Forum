<p><code>DataRowCollection</code> started in .NET 1.0, which predates generics. <code>List&lt;DataRow&gt;</code> could not have existed until the .NET Framework 2.0. During the 1.x days, the only way to make a strongly typed collection was to make your own class, like <code>DataRowCollection</code>.</p>

<p>It wasn't changed or updated to use <code>List&lt;DataRow&gt;</code> because that would be a major breaking change, and most likely because DataRowCollection does some specialized behavior that <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> does not do.</p>
