<p>These are the steps that I would follow to run the file:</p>

<ol>
<li>open Terminal (or Powershell if you're using Windows)</li>
<li>go to the directory in your terminal where the python file resides that you're trying to fun</li>
<li>run the python file using for Terminal: python filename.py
  or for Powershell: filename.py</li>
</ol>

<p>This should work for you.  If you're double clicking the file and trying to get it to run that way then yes, it will show a Terminal pop up and close immediately.  If you're trying to open it to edit it and you're using Windows, you need to right-click the file, and select "Edit with IDLE"</p>
