<p>when you go with the the 'default' user location, you can't. Because it isn't a real marker, the callbacks aren't fired.</p>

<p>What I did in our case is that I set <code>showsMyLocation=NO</code> but I rolled my own location. I  added another marker and used a <code>CLLocationManager</code> to position it according to THAT position..</p>

<p>So in pseudocode</p>

<pre><code>- viewDidLoad
    map.showsUserLocation=NO;
    locationManager = [CLLocationManager new];
    locationManager.delegate = self;
}

- locationManager:didUpdateUserLocation:newLoc {
    if(!annotation) {
        annotation = [GMSMarker new];
        annotation.map = map;
    }
    annotation.position = newLoc;
}
</code></pre>

<p>=> own annotation that you can treat like any other marker!</p>
