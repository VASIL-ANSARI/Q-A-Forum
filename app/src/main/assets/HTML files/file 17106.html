<p>I have seen this before. The reason was that the load balancer at the production site terminated the SSL connection. It by itself connected to IIS using HTTP only. This scheme is a way to offload the SSL computations to the load balancer. It means that the IIS application does never see the HTTPS protocol although the browser does see it.</p>

<p>As spender pointed out in the comments, please see the HTTP headers arriving at your application. The load balancer is likely to add information to them that allows you to reconstruct everything.</p>
