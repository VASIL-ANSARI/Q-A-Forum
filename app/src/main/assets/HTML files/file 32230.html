<p>The problem is with this line: </p>

<pre><code>NSArray* allmyKeys = [myDictionary allKeysForObject:@"Name1"]; 
</code></pre>

<p><code>@"Name1"</code> is a <strong>key</strong> in your dictionary, not a value. Even if it were a value, the string <code>@"Name1"</code> is a different object from the string with the same value in <code>myDictionary</code>, so this call would not do what you expect.</p>

<p>You probably want to access the dictionary by doing </p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *userDetails = myDictionary[@"Name1"];
</code></pre>
