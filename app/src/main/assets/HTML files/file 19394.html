<p>So I've gotten it working - I'm not sure <em>why</em> it's working though.</p>

<p>I think it may be that your border width needs to match up with the number specified in border-image, and I think border-image-slice may be messing things up.</p>

<p>Nevermind - i think it is exactly as you say - using border-image-slice causes odd behavior with the 'fill' in chrome. My example works because it is missing the offset of the border slices.</p>
