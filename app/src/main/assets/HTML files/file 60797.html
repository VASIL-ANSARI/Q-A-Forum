<p>Per comments: DeltaE (CIE76 and variations) works much better with a larger sample size. My original thought was that I would find the 'true' colors of the balls, and try to use that rather than have lots of samples that vary under lighting, but that proved ineffective, although maybe if the lighting itself could be accounted for, it could be possible.</p>

<p>In the end I did find a c# library called <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjkdu8ldnPAhXDro8KHaITDF8QFggeMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftompazourek%2FColourful&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmLNU-ICrTFyfVKir1Y7ZQ9lQFeQ&amp;sig2=3joKp-3RoNhgdUiOg_sJYQ" rel="nofollow">Colourful</a>, which is available on nuget, that was pretty easy to use and seemed well written. The RGB -> Lab transform is expensive, so preprocess where possible.</p>
