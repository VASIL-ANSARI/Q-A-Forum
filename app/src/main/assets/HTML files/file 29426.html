<p>Solved it!</p>

<p>Don't know if it works to all browsers, but at least it does on FF and Chrome:</p>

<p>Found out that somebody used the FILE type, so reused it and got its absolute path:</p>

<pre><code>protected File *fileName* = new File("*path to file*");
private String textFile = *fileName*.getAbsolutePath(); 
pageObject.getInput().sendKeys(textFile);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope somebody else finds it useful; as it's weird to be answering my own question.</p>
