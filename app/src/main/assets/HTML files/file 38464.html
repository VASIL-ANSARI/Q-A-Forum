<p>First reason: Your problem is in your notification method</p>

<pre><code>- (void)keyboardWillShow:(NSNotification *)sender;
</code></pre>

<p>Sender is a uitextfield or uitextview and you set frame of yelpSearchView. I think the  yelpSearchView background color is Clearcolor.</p>

<p>Second reason: In your design may have a problem. 
I see your constraints picture.
just Put the search bar in a view and set frame of that view</p>
