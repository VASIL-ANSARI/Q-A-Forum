<p>Remember that a Flex delivery is just a SWF file, with some extra magic around. You could just load it on a regular view or even a html file on the public directory and then have it talk with your Rails app.</p>

<p>We currently use Flex for charting some statistics and it was really painless to integrate. Since Rails favorites a RESTful approach, you can make your Flex app just call the right URIs for data and then work with the result (either JSON or XML).</p>
