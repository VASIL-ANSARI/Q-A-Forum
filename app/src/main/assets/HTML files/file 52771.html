<p>As smdsgn commented on your question, without code you've already tried, it is difficult for others to completely understand what you're trying to accomplish. Regardless, presuming I understand your question correctly I can provide you a couple of pointers.</p>

<p>If you simply want to add an image to your menu bar link when it's hovered over, utilize CSS' <code>:hover</code> selector with the <code>background</code> attribute (or the <code>background-image</code> attribute, if you prefer) as I've done in this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/jritchey/1tbfgr9z/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a>.</p>

<pre><code>nav ul li:hover {
  background: #someColour url(yourImage.file) no-repeat left;
  background-size: 50px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want more customization, such as hiding the link text when it's hovered over, you can implement some jQuery as I've done in this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/jritchey/6thau2vn/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a>.</p>

<pre><code>var hiddenText;

$('li').hover(function() {
  hiddenText = $(this).text();
  $(this).css({'background': '#someColour url(yourImage.file) no-repeat center','background-size': '50px'})
  $(this).text('');
}, function() {
  $(this).css({'background': '#someOtherColour'})
  $(this).text(hiddenText);
})
</code></pre>

<p>If neither of these pointers provide a solution for you, please add more detail to your question, as well as code you've tried.</p>
