<p>Simple!  The regular expression will be exactly the same text you need to remove.  So if you want to match:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML lang="en"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>your regular expression will be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML lang="en"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The only time you'll have a problem is when you have a character which has a reserved meaning, in that instance you just need to prefix with a \ .</p>

<p>So if you need to match a question mark (?) the regex would be \?</p>
