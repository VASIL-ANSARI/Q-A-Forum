<p>You should check your modelview/projection matrices and see if they are what you expect them to be in each function.</p>

<p>Also, as Christian's commented, it is not necessary, nor recommended, to draw in the motion func. Update your application state per the input and call glutPostRedisplay to signal that you want to redraw your window. That way, your application will have a cleaner design and it will be easier to make it behave consistently.</p>

<p><em>(added my comment as answer since that was the problem, and added Christian's comment, since that is the proper solution. <strong>Don't draw in motionfunc!</strong>.)</em></p>
