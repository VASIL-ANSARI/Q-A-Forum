<p>I'm not sure why you need <code>IBluetoothA2dp</code> and not the <code>BluetoothA2dp</code>. But the <code>IBluetoothA2dp</code> interface is a hidden interface (see <a href="http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#Ub44q3wMVa4/trunk/AndroidSDK/src/android/bluetooth/IBluetoothA2dp.java&amp;q=IBluetoothA2DP&amp;type=cs&amp;l=9" rel="nofollow">here</a>). At least up to Android 3.0 (not including). </p>

<p>As for <code>BluetoothA2dp</code> class it was publicly introduced in API Level 11 (Honeycomb, Android 3.0). It was first introduced in Android as earlier as API Level 3 and marked as hidden. Then it was dramatically changed in API Level 5 at still was marked as hidden. And officially released only in API Level 11. </p>

<p>You can use reflection to access that class on earlier platforms, but that's a tricky and not recommended way.</p>
