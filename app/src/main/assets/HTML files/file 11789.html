<p>For HTML parsing, I'd suggest <a href="http://jsoup.org/" rel="nofollow">jsoup</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides
  a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the
  best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.</p>
  
  <p>jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to
  the same DOM as modern browsers do.</p>
