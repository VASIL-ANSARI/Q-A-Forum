<p>Try this. You're missing a function pointer declaration in your struct. </p>

<p>Also, your func_ptr and func_ret calls are not typed correctly. I wouldn't hold pointer types in a uint64_t, I suggest using a <code>void *</code> as it will be the correct length for your architecture. You definitely shouldn't hold a function pointer in a uint64_t as there is no guaranteed by the standard that a <code>sizeof(funcptr) == sizeof(void *)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>double sum( double * a, long len )
{
    //...
    return 0.0;
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    long size = 1000;
    double * a = new double[size];

    struct args_t
    {
        /** you need a ptr declaration */
        double (*func_hsa)(double *, long );
        double * a_hsa;
        long len_hsa;
    } args;

    args.func_hsa = sum;
    args.a_hsa = a;
    args.len_hsa = size;

    double ret;

    ret = args.func_hsa(args.a_hsa, args.len_hsa);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
