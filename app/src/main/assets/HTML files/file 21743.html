<p>So, you could write a function that takes a function pointer and a <code>void *</code> (or <code>char *</code>) to the data, and a data-size. </p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't use only macros to do this, but you may have a macro that doe something like:</p>

<pre><code> #define MAP(func, type, arr, size) map(func, sizeof(type), arr, size)
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>map</code> is the function I describe above. </p>
