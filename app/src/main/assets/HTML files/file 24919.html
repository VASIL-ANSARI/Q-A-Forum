<pre><code>public MyClass(int index)
{
    this.index = index;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is at least the common way of doing in Java, and I guess it's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dk1507sz.aspx" rel="nofollow">the same in C#</a>. It makes the name more meaningful than <code>i</code>, and uses the same name as the property to designate the same thing.</p>
