<p>I don't know if this is what you want - "relaunch repeatedly by itself" is less than clear -  but the <code>exec</code> is easy enough to avoid.</p>

<p>Since you are already in the program image you want to relaunch you just need to <code>fork</code> new copies.  You can have a master copy whose one responsibility is to fork children and let the children run the actual program code that constitutes the real functionality.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>while ((! done)
{
    //wait on signal, fifo, socket, whatever

    if (somethingSaysWeAreDone)
        exit(0);

    if (fork == 0)
        break;
}

//children execute the rest of the program
</code></pre>

<p>Each child has a clean slate of segments other than the one or two variables above which they should never need anyway.  I don't see any way you can avoid a fork though and obviously you need some kind of mechanism to communicate to the "master" copy that it should reproduce.</p>
