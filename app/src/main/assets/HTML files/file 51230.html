<p>If you want to suspend with user input, a simple <code>prompt()</code> box will do.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>var input = prompt("Enter data here", "");
</code></pre>

<p>This will wait for input and store it into variable <code>input</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/spjs8spp/" rel="nofollow">working example</a> on JSFiddle.net.</p>

<p>AFAIK, synchronous JS is not possible, as according to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19509296/wait-for-a-user-event">this SO post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript is asynchronous, you cannot "pauses" execution. Moreover, while javascript is running the entire user interface freezes, so the user cannot click the button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to your question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I shouldn't be using a while loop, what would replace it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because JS is event driven, and you're trying to run code every time that button is clicked (and input is entered), just use a <code>onclick</code> handler.</p>

<p>So, rather than this:</p>

<pre><code>while(active) {
    input = game_u.getText();
    p = new player();
    active = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
    input = game_u.getText();
    p = new player();
    active = false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will run the code every time the button is clicked, essentially the same as what you're trying to do.</p>
