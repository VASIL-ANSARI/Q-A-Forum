<p>Well, you are calling id[i] twice in your loop. You could store it in a variable, or a register int if you wanted to. </p>

<pre><code>register int index;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
{
index = id[i];
++size[index];
sum[index] += value[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The MSDN docs state this about register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The register keyword specifies that
  the variable is to be stored in a
  machine register.. Microsoft Specific</p>
  
  <p>The compiler does not accept user
  requests for register variables;
  instead, it makes its own register
  choices when global
  register-allocation optimization (/Oe
  option) is on. However, all other
  semantics associated with the register
  keyword are honored.</p>
