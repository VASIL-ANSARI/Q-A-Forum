<p>This is not specific to Caliburn.Micro and relates to WPF in general. In general I would argue that your application should not size to the content, rather the content should size to the application.</p>

<p>In Caliburn.Micro specifically the best place to set the size is on your ShellView as this is what you should load your ViewModels into. Since the shell is always there you simply need to set the shell size and let the content scale out to fit.</p>
