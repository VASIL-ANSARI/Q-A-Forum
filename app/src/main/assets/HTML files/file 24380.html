<p>I think that since you want to reference files that only exist after a build that you somehow force the build to happen before you need the references resolved.  You could cheat by just doing a build from within Eclipse.  That would leave the generated source files in place ready to be referenced.  I think, however, that the maven philosophy would have you move the generated code to another maven artifact entirely.  That would let you separate the lifecycle of the two groups of code so that when you're ready to use Eclipse to edit the hand-coded code, references to generated classes are resolved because you've already generated that code in the build of an separate, independent module. </p>
