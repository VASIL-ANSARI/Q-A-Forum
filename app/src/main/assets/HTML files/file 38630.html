<p>I get this with android studio too... </p>

<p>Close android studio, restart ADB, and generally it starts working for me. </p>

<p>If that does not work then put a breakpoint at the line <code>.show();</code> ... Then open up the logcat and then skip over the breakpoint. It then shows, I have similar issues. </p>
