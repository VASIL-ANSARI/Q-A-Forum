<p>What are you adding up for Sum()? Can you try:</p>

<pre><code>int lola = (from c in context.GetTRANSACTIONSQuery()
            where ((c.CHART_ACC == transStudID) &amp;&amp; (c.sch_year == 13))
            select c.PROPERTYTHATYOUWANTTOADDUP).Sum();
</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps you wanted to count how many items match your query?</p>

<pre><code>int lola = (from c in context.GetTRANSACTIONSQuery()
            where ((c.CHART_ACC == transStudID) &amp;&amp; (c.sch_year == 13))
            select c).Count();
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So since you want to add up the AMOUNT property:</p>

<pre><code>decimal lola = (from c in context.GetTRANSACTIONSQuery()
            where ((c.CHART_ACC == transStudID) &amp;&amp; (c.sch_year == 13))
            select (decimal)c.AMOUNT).Sum();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also make sure that c.AMOUNT is never null so you don't run into an error in the future:</p>

<pre><code>decimal lola = (from c in context.GetTRANSACTIONSQuery()
            where ((c.CHART_ACC == transStudID) &amp;&amp; (c.sch_year == 13) &amp;&amp; (c.AMOUNT != null))
            select (decimal)c.AMOUNT).Sum();
</code></pre>
