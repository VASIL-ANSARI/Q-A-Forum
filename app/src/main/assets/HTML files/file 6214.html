<p>Basically you just need to find a hex parser - there are plenty around, with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/140131/convert-a-string-representation-of-a-hex-dump-to-a-byte-array-using-java">one example here</a>, or <a href="http://commons.apache.org/codec/" rel="nofollow">Apache Commons Codec</a> for this and other conversions. While Java bytes are indeed signed, you'll get the same bit pattern as if they were unsigned, so they'll have the same way. Unless you're performing your own arithmetic/bit-shifting on byte values, you can <em>usually</em> ignore the fact that bytes are signed in Java.</p>
