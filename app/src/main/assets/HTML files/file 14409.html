<p>Because <code>obj as string</code> and <code>obj.ToString()</code> are not the same. The first is an attempted cast (sort of like <code>(string)obj</code>, but which returns <code>null</code> upon failure), while the seconds is a method call returning a string representation of the object.</p>

<p>Practically you can get the string representation of any object regardless of whether it's compatible with string as type, but the cast will fail if they are not compatible.</p>

<p>Simple example:</p>

<pre><code>object obj = new object(); // simple object
Console.WriteLine(obj.ToString()); // prints System.Object
Console.WriteLine((obj as string) == null); // True: obj is not a string!
</code></pre>
