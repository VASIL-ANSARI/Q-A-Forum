<p>From a cursory glance, I believe your problem lies in the fact that you modify <code>i</code> in multiple locations aside from the <code>for</code> loop declaration. This would cause your scan through the number to skip over sequences that could have potentially been correct.\</p>

<p>If you reason out your code, it starts at position 0 in the string. Then you have a conditional where you increment <code>i</code> 4 times, so then the next time through the loop, you start attempting to find a sequence starting at position 4 in the string, rather than starting at position 1.</p>
