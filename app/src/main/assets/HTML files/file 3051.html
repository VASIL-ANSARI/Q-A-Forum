<p>If you try to validate the URL itself as a valid RTSP URL, I think that it's only the protocol token that changes from <code>http://</code> to <code>rtsp://</code> or <code>rtspu://</code>, and implicitly, the default port is no longer 80, but 554.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt" rel="nofollow">RTSP RFC</a>, section 3.2 ("RTSP URL") for more details regarding URL format.</p>

<p>However, if wish to know if "behind" a given RTSP URL there's a running RTSP server, you should actually open a connection to this server, usually using TCP sockets. You can make the "conversation" simply via code, but I suggest you use some kind of a product/library that provides RTSP stack for Python; I don't know if such product actually exists for Python, but there are a few things for C/C++.</p>
