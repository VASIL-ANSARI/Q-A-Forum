<p>You use the javascript function valida() . But it seems that this is not available.Am not sure becuase your code is very awful.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name="example" id="example" action="submit-example.php" method="post" onsubmit="return valida();"&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Thats why this function return false on onsubmit and form not submitted.</p>
