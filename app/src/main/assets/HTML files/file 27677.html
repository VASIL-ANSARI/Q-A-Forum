<p><code>android:label</code> <em>generally</em> controls the display names of components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On an <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code>, it controls things like the caption associated with a launcher icon, or the default title in the action bar</p></li>
<li><p>On a <code>&lt;receiver&gt;</code>, it controls things like the display name of an app widget in the device's roster of available app widgets</p></li>
<li><p>On a <code>&lt;service&gt;</code>, it apparently covers how the service is named in the list of running services (I never tried this, which is why I started with a comment...)</p></li>
<li><p>On an <code>&lt;application&gt;</code>, not only does it control things like the name in the installed apps list in Settings, but it provides the default for all <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;receiver&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> elements that do not override it</p></li>
</ul>
