<p>It looks like you were inconsistent with the key used to store and retrieve the value.</p>

<p>The <code>putExtra</code> method accepts the key as the first parameter and the value as the second.
From what you wrote I assume that "JOBID" is the key yet in <code>callEditActivity</code> you use "TEST" as the key.</p>

<p>Make sure you are consistent with this and everything will align into place.</p>

<p>For setting the extra intent parameter use:</p>

<pre><code>intentEditJob.putExtra("JOBID", "TEST");
</code></pre>

<p>For retrieving the extra intent parameter use:</p>

<pre><code>String editJobID = intentExtras.getStringExtra("JOBID");   
</code></pre>
