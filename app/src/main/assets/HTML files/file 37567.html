<pre><code>has_many :sales
</code></pre>

<p>This needs to be plural.</p>

<pre><code>class Branch &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :sales
end
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to specify the class name here and the foreign key should be branch_id (I'm guessing) which also doesn't need to be specified.</p>
