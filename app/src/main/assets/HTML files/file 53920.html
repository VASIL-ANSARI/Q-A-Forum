<p>When I tried to train a cascade last year, I had this same problem. What I found is that it's very memory hungry, so if you used 5000 images sampled at the sizes you wrote (-w 100 -h 60), your PC probably went out of memory (or other thing such as a heap size limit perhaps). Seems to me that trainscascade puts all of the sample data in RAM to train. </p>

<p>You'll probably have to try much smaller sizes such as the example of the documentation you mentioned, -w 24 -h 24, and increase in small amounts until you got a good size but no crashes.</p>
