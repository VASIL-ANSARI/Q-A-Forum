<p>EDIT: I thought this question was about the status of the implementation of Javascript in IE8. Note that "JScript" (ignore "JScript.NET") was historically the name given to Microsoft's "Active Scripting" implementation of ECMAScript, which I have described below:</p>

<p>JScript, as found in Internet Explorer versions 3 through version 8, is implemented using the <strong>Active Scripting</strong> engine, which is shared with the Windows Script Host for the execution of shell <code>*.vbs</code> and <code>*.js</code> files, and also shared by the server-side Classic ASP environment.</p>

<p>In the long-term Active Scripting looks to be deprecated: on the server-side Classic ASP is considered dead (last update was version 3.0 with Windows 2000 back in 1999), in the browser it has been replaced with the JIT "Chakra" engine in Internet Explorer 9, and in the shell it has been replaced with PowerShell.</p>

<p>However Microsoft will support Active Scripting for a while: Windows 8 provides full support for the system and Windows 8's support lifecycle shouldn't end until 2022 (assuming MS sticks to the 10-year lifecycle support policy).</p>
