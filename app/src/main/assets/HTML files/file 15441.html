<p>As for usability, for latest browsers i would advice is to use drag &amp; drop upload functionality (that's really cool!) with "old-fashioned" ajax file transfer fallback for old browsers, that is based on flash.</p>

<p>Look at this jQuery plugin for example:

<p>As for security, i would advice to check file mime type if it is possible (if you have PHP fileinfo extension) with PHP. Unfortunately, i am not familiar with Codeigniter (i use ZF), but i am sure that Codeigniter has filters/validators for files.</p>

<p>Form validation in CI:</p>
