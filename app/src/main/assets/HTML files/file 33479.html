<p>So <code>entry</code> is the answer you get? Maybe try regex, you can use this code after submitting the answer or you could check this when a user edits the EditText. The last thing can be done with a TextWatcher, but that would make it a bit more complicated than necessary. </p>

<pre><code>if(entry.matches("[0-9]+") {
  // new question
} else {
  // warning no valid answer
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want your users only have the option to input numbers. You should set in your EditText:</p>

<pre><code>android:inputType="number"
</code></pre>
