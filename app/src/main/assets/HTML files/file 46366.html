<p>Yes, I figured it out. The answer here was nothing mysterious. In my singleton class, I was creating a Bus object and handing that over as the instance.  I wasn't making a BusProvider.  Therefore, when I called post, it wasn't calling the BusProvider overridden method but the Bus method, which wasn't "thread safe" in my case. After I changed the code to reflect this recognition, it worked great!</p>
