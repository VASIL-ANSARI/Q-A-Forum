<p>Here is how you could do this in sql server. This is known as a crosstab, some people call this a conditional aggregate. Another option would be to use a PIVOT. I find the syntax for a crosstab less obtuse than pivot and it generally has a very slight advantage for performance.</p>

Or if you don't know how many columns you will need to do a dynamic version of this.

<pre><code>create table #Something
(
    Id char(5)
    , User_name varchar(20)
    , User_id int
)

insert #Something
select 'DT122', 'Doe, John', 123 union all
select 'DT122', 'Yum, Mi', 124

select Id
    , MAX(case when RowNum = 1 then User_Name end) as UserName1
    , MAX(case when RowNum = 2 then User_Name end) as UserName2
from
(
    select ID
        , USER_NAME
        , USER_ID
        , ROW_NUMBER() over (PARTITION BY Id order by user_name) as RowNum
    from #Something
) x
group by x.Id

drop table #Something
</code></pre>
