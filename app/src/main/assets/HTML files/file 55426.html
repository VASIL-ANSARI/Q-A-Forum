<p>When the constructor is invoked you already have an instance of the object you're creating, and thus you can simply modify the instance's methods without touching the prototype:</p>

<pre><code>export default class AI {

    constructor(algObj, player) {
        this.player = player;
        this.algObj = algObj;

        //create the shoot and placeShips prototypes form the this.algObj property
        this.initialize   = new Function(this.algObj.initialize);
        this.shoot        = new Function(this.algObj.shoot);
        this.placeShips   = new Function(this.algObj.placeShips);

        this.initialize();
    }
}
</code></pre>
