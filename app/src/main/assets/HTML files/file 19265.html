<p>The one way of doing this is as follows:</p>

<p>Subclass from <code>UIImageView</code> set <code>touchesBegan</code> methods for each UIImageView for import image, setting on background and whatever you want to do on touch. </p>

<p>What does 'attached' mean? If all of them should move together, then, again, you have to deal with it in <code>touchesBegan</code> methods, sending messages like 'Hey views, i've moved on this vector:[vector], please do it too'.</p>

<p>In pt. 3.2 i didn't get your point. :( You can set in <code>UIImageView</code> subclass <code>self.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit</code> or <code>UIViewContentModeScaleToFill</code>, so its image will always fit the view.</p>

<p>About irregular shape, did you read links below? I suppose there's not an super easy way to do it :(</p>
