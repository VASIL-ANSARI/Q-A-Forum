<p>Views are not just JSP, but any view technology, such as JasperReports</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought the purpose is to separate model and controller (that's why
  we use MVC) so why is your business logic can be the same class as
  your controller?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You business logic should go in service classes, which are referenced by controllers. You can put some simple validation in entities themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what exactly is Model and Controller in Spring?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Model is a map of any data that your view might need. It can contain Entities, or Form Backing Objects or Strings or anything you want.</p>

<p>DispatcherServlet is your <em>front</em> controller, not your regular controller.</p>

<p>Controller is a class with Handler Methods that are called due to HTTP requests, and generally collect model data and pass them to a view. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>can you have two controllers? (@Controller class and dispatcher
  servlet)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can have as many controller as you want. The more the merrier! Generally one front controller is enough. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Models in spring are from @modelattribute objects or the beans from
  business logic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>@ModelAttribute</code> is a special, ill-documented, poorly-understood annotation that shouldn't worry about until you understand the basics. </p>

<p>Model is a map of anything you want. It is all of the data that the view needs to do its view thing. </p>
