<p>You need to increase the <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/" rel="nofollow">specificity</a> of your last rule enough so that it becomes at least equal to the specificity of the third rule; it will then override the third rule and the item will become red as it should.</p>

<p>Do this by writing the last rule as</p>

<pre><code>ul:hover li:first-child:hover { color: red; }â
</code></pre>
