<p>OpenTK makes use of whatever OpenGL version is available on your system.  When you install drivers for a vendor graphics card, you are (also) installing their version of OpenGL.  In the absence of hardware-accelered OpenGL version, most (all?) modern operating systems have a software OpenGL implementation that they fall back onto.  This should work seemlessly without you having to do anything.  However, on Windows, this will probably be quite an ancient OpenGL version (1.1), which will may not support everything you want to do.</p>
