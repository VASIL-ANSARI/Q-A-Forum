<p>PHP provides a way to track your upload progress, read more about it here - <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/session.upload-progress.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/session.upload-progress.php</a></p>

<p>The upload progress will be available in the $_SESSION when an upload is in progress. You can get the key name for your upload using this, </p>

<pre><code>$key =  ini_get("session.upload_progress.name");
print_r($_SESSION[$key]);
</code></pre>

<p>Now to cancel your upload, simply call the $_SESSION with the key and set cancel_upload to TRUE.</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION[$key]["cancel_upload"] = true;
</code></pre>

<p>This will only abort the in-progress uploads and not the completed ones.</p>
