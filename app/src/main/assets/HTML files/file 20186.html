<p>This doesn't actually edit the function in place, but it does replace the function on that module with a new function without a temporary file (which may be good enough):</p>

<pre><code>import inspect
import func

code = inspect.getsourcelines(func.function)
lines = code[0]
lines.insert(2,"    print 'There'\n")

exec ''.join(lines)
func.function = function
</code></pre>
