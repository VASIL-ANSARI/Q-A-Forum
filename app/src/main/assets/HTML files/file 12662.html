<p>Is it iterating through the for loop? I see you have an echo, did that write anything out? How many items does it have to iterate through? 5 min seems like a long time but if there are a lot of items that could be why it's taking so long. Are you seeing any errors in your logs?</p>

<p>Something you might try is hold the count in a variable so it doesn't have to calculate that each time.  It might speed up your for loop but I'm not sure it will insert the data.</p>

<pre><code>for($i = 0, $count = count($this-&gt;model-&gt;chk); $i &lt; $count; ++$i)
    {
        $sqlTracks = "INSERT INTO todos VALUES(DEFAULT,
            {$this-&gt;sanitizeTracks($this-&gt;model-&gt;chk[$i])},
            NULL,
            {$this-&gt;sanitizeTracks($shortDescNoQuotes)},
            {$this-&gt;sanitizeTracks($notes)},
            now(),
            {$this-&gt;sanitizeTracks($dueDate)},
            NULL,
            12,
            NULL,
            'active',
            NULL,
            now() );";

    //echo $sqlTracks;

    $this-&gt;executeTracks( $sqlTacks );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I found this in the PHP for loop reference: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.for.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.for.php</a></p>
