<p>Just before updating the screen with <code>pygame.display.flip</code>, your code runs <code>screen.blit(background,(0,0))</code>, which completely overrides everything you have drawn to the screen. Moving the blitting of the background to the beginning of your <code>while keepGoing</code> loop would solve this.</p>
