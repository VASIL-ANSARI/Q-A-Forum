<p>There was some discussion on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/exceldna" rel="nofollow">Excel-DNA Google group</a> here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/exceldna/browse_frm/thread/58da470968d6658b" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/group/exceldna/browse_frm/thread/58da470968d6658b</a> This shows how to handle the C API ON.RECALC event, which fires after a recalculation.</p>

<p>You can get also hold of the Excel Application COM object with a call to <code>ExcelDnaUtil.Application</code>, and then register your event handlers for the Application events. The Application events are documented here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj734018.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj734018.aspx</a> and you might be interested in <code>AfterCalculate</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know of any Excel events that fire <em>before</em> recalculation.</p>
