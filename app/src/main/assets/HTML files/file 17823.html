<pre><code>print '2' == 2

<p>A slightly less snarky answer -- as noted by a commenter to the OP, the issue is that raw_input returns a string and you are comparing all of your responses as integers.</p>

<p>You could change answer to an int, but why bother? Why not just change your code so your are checking to see if the answer is a specific string?</p>
