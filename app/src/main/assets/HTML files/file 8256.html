<p>I'm presuming you're using Office10 and the Word API.  Based on this @Richard is correct.  Words are broken by punctuation, a space, or being at the start or end of a line.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid the split you may be better off selecting your words using a RegEx and Matches collection.  Something like <code>Regex.Matches(Document.Text, @"[A-Za-z0-9]+")</code> may help.  (And stick the punctuation that you want into the square brackets.</p>
