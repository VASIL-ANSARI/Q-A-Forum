<p>I'm unsure what <code>pDoc-&gt;DFE</code> is doing. Didn't you mean <code>pDoc-&gt;vDFE</code>?</p>

<p>The debug message is signalling a memory problem.</p>

<p>Did you size the vector? Try, for example, </p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;CDFE&gt; vDFE(10);
</code></pre>

<p>Which will create a vector with 10 default constructed CFDE.</p>

<p>Make sure that i doesn't get bigger than 9.</p>
