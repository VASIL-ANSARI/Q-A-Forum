<p>You might want to read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1163459/reading-integers-from-binary-file-in-python">Read ints from file in python</a>
It is even more straightforward from that question.</p>

<p>I have not checked the following code but something along the spirit of </p>

<pre><code>fin = open("hi.bmp", "rb")
out = open("values.txt","rw")
value = struct.unpack('i', fin.read(4))[0]
out.write("%d\n" % value) # just loop over the 2 last lines
out.close()
fin.close()
</code></pre>

<p>should do the trick, if you want to record the ints as readable integers in another file.</p>
