<p>I was able to add graphical elements using WindowManager to display stuff on top of other stuff (within my app and outside) from a service.</p>

<p>Take a look at how we do that in GlobalTouchService from our project (<a href="https://github.com/jinkim608/reach.io" rel="nofollow">Reach.io</a>).</p>

<p>If you are just displaying something and interacting with those elements you added, this method will be sufficient. Interacting with other apps(outside your app) through that interface requires additional stuff.</p>
