<p>If your tables aren't that big, the easiest way to probably an explicit <code>union all</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select t.*
from (select eqnum, photo1 as photo, description from table1 union all
      select eqnum, photo2, description from table1 union all
      select eqnum, photo3, description from table1 union all
      select eqnum, photo4, description from table1 union all
      select eqnum, photo5, description from table1
     ) t
where photo is not null;
</code></pre>

<p>You can add an <code>into</code> clause to create a table.  This version will read the table five times.  Unpivot is more efficient, but that only really makes a difference if your table is somewhat large table, say hundreds of thousands of rows or more.</p>
