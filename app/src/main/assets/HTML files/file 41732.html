<p>You can achieve this with a SQL passthrough statement:</p>

<pre><code>proc sql;
    connect to odbc as YourAlias ( dsn = YourDSNName connection = SHARED );
    execute (
            exec uspYourStoredProcedure;
            ) by YourAlias;

create table SAS.YourDataSet as 
    select * 
    from connection to YourAlias (
                                  select * 
                                  from #TempTableCreatedAbove
                                  );
disconnect from YourAlias;
quit;
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to modify the example as follows:</p>

<p><code>YourAlias</code>   = Give the connection an alias</p>

<p><code>YourDSNName</code> = Your system DSN for the connection</p>

<p><code>uspYourStoredProcedure</code> = Replace with the name of your stored procedure</p>

<p><code>YourDataSet</code> = Provide a name for your new SAS Data Set</p>

<p><code>#TempTableCreatedAbove</code> = Replace with the name of the temp table created as a result of executing your stored procedure</p>

<p>You should see a new SAS data set once you replace the values above and execute the statement.</p>
