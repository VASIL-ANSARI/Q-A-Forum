<p>I confess things get a little confusing with XML documents and encodings, but I'd hope that it would get set appropriate when you save it again, if you're still using ISO-8859-1 - but that if you save with UTF-8, it wouldn't need to. In some ways, logically the document really contains the symbol rather the entity reference - the latter is just an encoding matter. (I'm thinking aloud here - please don't take this as authoritative information.)</p>

<p>What are you doing with the document after loading it?</p>
