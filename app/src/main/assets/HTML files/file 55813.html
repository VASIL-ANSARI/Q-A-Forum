<p>Assuming your code is at root or in <code>/lib</code>, the method will run first on the client, then on the server. This is done for <em>latency compensation</em> and on the client is referred to as <em>simulation</em>. The <code>.isServer</code> and <code>.isClient</code> give you control over what environment you want your code to run in.</p>

<p>If you put methods in <code>/client</code> then they will only run on the client and vice versa if you put them in <code>/server</code>.</p>

<p>With the new ES6 imports you have specific control over what gets imported into each environment.</p>
