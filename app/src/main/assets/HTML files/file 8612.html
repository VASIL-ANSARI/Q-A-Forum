<p>First off, you need to distinguish between flash and flex:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flash is mainly used for making animations, basic websites, games. It is far more lightweight than flex.</p></li>
<li><p>Flex is a framework mainly used for creating rich internet applications. It is more robust, and offers the developer many built in components to create applications fast. For an overview check out <a href="http://flex.org/tour/" rel="nofollow">tour de flex</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you know which technology you are going to use you can decide on the software to buy</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to create a Flash CS5 project in Flash Builder you will need Flash CS5 AND Flash Builder. Flash Builder has better coding support such as code completion, ... but it is not necessary to achieve your goal.<br/>In fact, most flash developers use <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/" rel="nofollow">FlashDevelop</a> or <a href="http://www.fdt.powerflasher.com/" rel="nofollow">FDT eclipse plugin</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To develop Flex you can either use Flex Builder or Flash Builder.<br/>You can use the flex 4.5 SDK in Flex Builder as well, so you can develop flex 4 in Flex builder as well. Off course, Flash Builder has more extra features than Flex Builder.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose Flash Builder, you should know that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flash Builder 4.5 was released mainly for Mobile and Flash Catalyst support</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash-builder/flashbuilder_php.html" rel="nofollow">Flash Builder 4.5 for PHP</a> supports Zend Framework</li>
</ul>

<p>So really, the choice all depends on what you want to achieve and how. You are the only one who can answer that question, so I suggest to dig in a little deeper and look at all the benefits of one vs the other.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
