<p>Edit:
A simple example of a POP3 server can be found here: <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/534131-pypopper-python-pop3-server/" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/534131-pypopper-python-pop3-server/</a> You will have to replace the message serving mechanism, but you would need to do that anyway. For an IMAP server implementation using Twisted, see <a href="https://github.com/davglass/twimapd" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/davglass/twimapd</a> . </p>

<p>If you want email, then you're looking at SMTP, POP and IMAP. That's what email is by definition.</p>

<p>Actually, for delivery, SMTP should be enough; POP/IMAP is for retrieval and is not really that useful if your applications can always connect to each other directly.</p>

<p>If you don't need to use email specifically, you might want to look into alternative protocols, such as XMPP (Jabber): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol</a></p>
