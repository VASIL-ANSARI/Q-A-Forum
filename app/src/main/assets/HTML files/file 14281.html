<p>The problem here is programming languages use cursors to handle sets of tuples, cursors can only iterate through them you cant do bulk loading or anything like that, this is true for I think every programming languages, a faster solution would be connecting Oracle to PostgreSQL somehow, I'm not sure how to do that but I think it should be possible. there are Oracle functions for everything. </p>
