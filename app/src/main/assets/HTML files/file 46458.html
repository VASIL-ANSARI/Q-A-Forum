<p>There are three thigs I would do: </p>

<p>First of  all, I would check the compatibility canvas.clipPath() with your target API version, it should be 18 or higher.</p>

<p>Second, I would check where and how you declare Path object(mPath).</p>

<p>Third, I would make sure that canavas already exist by the time you trying to clipPath().  Also, it might not be the issue, but according to API for FrameLayout: Child views are drawn in a stack, with the most recently added child on top, so make sure the child you are working with is accessible. </p>
