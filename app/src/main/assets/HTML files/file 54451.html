<p>Assuming that you're data binding your DataList, you just need to add "Add New Item" to your data source before calling DataBind on your DataList.  I don't know what your data source is but the logic should be similar to whatever you're using.  If you're binding to a DataTable you will need to make sure that the sort makes your "Add New Item" entry be the last one.  You may need to add a sort column or something that you give your own incrementing id to and sort based on that column. </p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; values = new List&lt;string&gt;();
            values.Add("Item 1");
            values.Add("Item 2");
            values.Add("Add New Item");
            DataList dataList = new DataList();
            dataList.DataSource = values;
            dataList.DataBind();
</code></pre>
