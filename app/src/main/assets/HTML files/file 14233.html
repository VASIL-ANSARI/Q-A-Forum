<p>I didn't find a way to do a directoryList Ftp request with filters but i might have a way to improve the performance of your solution.<br><br>
You could start a new thread that fetches the directoryList every x minutes and stores the result in memory. <br>If you are looking for a file you could serve the list from memory(greatly improving performance) at the risk of not finding the file (at which point you could perform your current code). In a worst case scenario the memory search operation will cause a little overhead but it should be neglectable compared to an ftp request with such a big result set.</p>
