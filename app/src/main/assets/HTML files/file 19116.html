<p>It's not possible for CSS to guess what you want to happen -- meaning that it wants to cascade elements downward as opposed to horizontally, which is what you want.</p>

<p>Set the itemsContainer width to a 100% X the number of elements.</p>

<pre><code>.itemsContainer 
{
width:300%; /* since you have 3 elements
}
</code></pre>
