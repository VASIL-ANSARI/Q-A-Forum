<p>The basic principle of unit testing is that each unit (<code>Car::Wheel</code>, <code>Car::Door</code>) should be tested separately. When you compose two classes you can be sure, that the underlying elements are properly implemented.</p>

<p>Instead of having <code>run</code> method you should have methods with single responsibility (just build and not build &amp; serialize):</p>

<pre><code>  def self.build(wheels, doors)
    car = Car.new
    car.wheels = Car::Wheel.load_json(wheels)
    car.doors = Car::Door.load_json(doors)
    car
  end

  def self.run(wheels, doors)
    self.build.to_s
  end
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can easily test output of <code>build</code> method as it return an object.</p>
