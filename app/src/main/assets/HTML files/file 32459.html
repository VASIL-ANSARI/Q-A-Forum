<p>Ultimately, I had two problems and didn't realize it.</p>

<ol>
<li>My AVD was bad (which caused my menu to have strange gaps in it - as pictured above). Once I deleted the AVD and built a new one, I was able to see some menu items - although the "Save" button still wouldn't re-draw</li>
<li>There was a timing issue between when InvalidateOptionsMenu was trying to execute and when my ViewPager was trying to draw itself and send its own Invalidate calls.</li>
</ol>

<p>This link led me to the right answer:</p>
