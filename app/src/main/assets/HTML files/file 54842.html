<p>The one issue I see security wise is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided to add username and password as arguments to all the
  authentication required endpoint API calls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do that, then the username and password will be part of the URL request. Instead, make your API method(s) POST and create a wrapper class that uses a simple POJO that has <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> properties with getter and setters and pass that class in as the argument. </p>

<p>FYI You can only pass in one class as an argument into Cloud Endpoints API methods, so if you have multiple class/entities you want to pass in you will have to create another wrapper class that just has those classes/entities as properties with getters/setters. </p>

<p>Also, make sure you hash/encrypt user passwords when they are created so you are not passing around plain text passwords. There is lots of info out there on how to do that in Java if you google it. </p>
