  <p>Is there a way to create a bitmap using a layout xml on a background/worker thread? </p>

<p>AFAIK, working with widgets on a background thread is not a problem, so long as they are not connected to any window (e.g., they are not part of an activity or dialog). Inflating a layout might be a problem -- I seem to recall running into that with instrumentation tests, which do not run on the main application thread. But you're welcome to try putting your <code>inflate()</code> call and all of the <code>createMarkerBitmap()</code> logic into a background thread.</p>

<p>However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating and populating widgets normally does not take much time. You may be better served using Traceview to determine why yours is taking so long.</p></li>
<li><p>If the issue isn't that an individual bitmap is slow, but that you are creating two tons of bitmaps, that will be a problem regardless of how you do it. Just because the work is done on a background thread does not make it "free" from a CPU standpoint, plus there are memory pressures to consider.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You could draw directly to the <code>Canvas</code> using the methods available on <code>Canvas</code>.</p>
