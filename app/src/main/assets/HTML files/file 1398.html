<p>Finally I found out it is just straightforward. Behalf of browserCMS, I can simple add the compass gem to my rails app. Instead of the default styles given in the themes, stylesheets generated by compass will be used. So it just the same as with other rails applications. Nothing new under the sun.</p>
