<p>You have two ways. The first is to use <a href="http://file:///usr/share/doc/python2.7-doc/html/library/functools.html#functools.partial" rel="nofollow">functools.partial</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foo = self.get('foo')
bar = self.get('bar')
callable = functools.partial(func, foo, x=bar)
self.apply(callable, variable)
</code></pre>

<p>while the second approach is to use the same technique used by partial, you can define a function that accept arbitrary argument list:</p>

<pre><code>def apply(self, function, variable, *args, **kwds):
    result={}
    for k,v in self.get(variable).items():
        result[k] = function(v, *args, **kwds)
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in both case the function signature remains unchanged. I don't know which one I'll choose, maybe the first case but I don't know the context on you are working on.</p>
