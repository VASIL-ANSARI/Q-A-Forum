<p>after analyzing your dumps it seems like the problem is the textwatchers that have been added to the edittext. Since listeners in an edittext are saved internally in an arraylist they keep getting appended to the list leading to a leak. try to remove or clean all listeners from the edittext before you add new ones. that should fix the leak.</p>
