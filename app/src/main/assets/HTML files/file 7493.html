<p>You could use cookies. So you may check for the presence of some custom cookie and if not present show the message and emit the cookie so that the next time the message is not shown. Here's a nice <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie" rel="nofollow">plugin for jquery</a> that simplifies reading and writing cookies:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var cookie = $.cookie('some_cookie_name');
    if (cookie == null) {
        // the cookie is not present =&gt; you may do the checks
        if ($.browser.msie &amp;&amp; $.browser.version == '7.0') {
            // set the cookie so that the next time the user visits this page
            // he doesn't get the alert message
            $.cookie('some_cookie_name', 'true');
            alert("Please upgrade your browser to at least version 8.0 in order to use all the features of this site.\n\nThank you.");
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
