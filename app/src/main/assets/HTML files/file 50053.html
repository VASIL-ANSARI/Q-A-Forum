<p>Flask-SQLAlchemy doesn't come with Flask.  You need to install it.  You are correct, <code>flask.ext</code> is deprecated, but all it is is a "shortcut" for accessing other installed packages that are Flask extensions.  Since you haven't installed Flask-SQLAlchemy, you can't import it.</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install flask-sqlalchemy
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It is bad practice to manually install libraries to the system Python location (<code>sudo pip</code>).  Use a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/installing/#creating-virtual-environments" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>.</p>
