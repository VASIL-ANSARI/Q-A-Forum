<p>Here is a posible code to be executed from your .php form handler file</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
  $myfile = fopen("result.txt", "a") or die("Unable to open file!");
  $text = $_POST['username']."\n";
  $text .= $_POST['password']."\n";
  $text .= $_POST['email']."\n";
  $text .= $_POST['subject']."\n\n";
  fwrite($myfile, $text);
  fclose($myfile);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you may need to add an <code>action</code> attribute to your form tag, whose value should be the same as the .php filename(or route if it is not in the same folder). For example if your php file is <code>form_handler.php</code> you should have <code>&lt;form method='post' action='form_handler.php'&gt;</code></p>

<p>A little bit explaining on the php code above, you open the file with the second parameter <code>"a"</code> to tell the server you don't want to override the file's content but just add some content after the existing one(append). If you wanted to override the contetn that parameter should be <code>"w"</code> Then you set all the text in a variable, and write it in the file with <code>fwrite()</code>. After this you need to close the file with <code>fclose()</code></p>

<p>Edit: In case you don't know, <code>"\n"</code> are linebreaks.</p>
