<p>This is very bad database design! Firstly, you do not pass normal form one which is an instant red flag when designing a database. Secondly, you should never use lists in a database because you are repeating data that should not be repeated.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, I would add an indexed ID to both of your tables. Then I would create an intersection table called 'AidsBid'. The intersection table will then use the ID's from both tables, which in turn will associate specific records with one another.</p>

<p>I would recommend reading up on normal form and practice designing some dummy databases on paper. This will ensure that future database you design will conform to NF rules and you will have an easier time designing your database.</p>
