<p>I would start by fixing the explode to be on <code>' - '</code>, since <code>'-'</code> is leaving extra spaces at the beginning and end of your date strings. That will fix it. Shown here: <a href="https://eval.in/404554" rel="nofollow">https://eval.in/404554</a></p>

<p>Next, you don't need to bother with str_replace on them.</p>

<pre><code>$dates = '07/24/2015 - 07/24/2015';
$newdate = explode(" - ", $dates);

$date1 = DateTime::createFromFormat('m/d/Y', $newdate[0]);
$date2 = DateTime::createFromFormat('m/d/Y', $newdate[1]);
</code></pre>
