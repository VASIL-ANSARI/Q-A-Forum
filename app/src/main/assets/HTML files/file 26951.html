<p>You can pass a custom environment variable in the xcodebuild command line to pass the location of app icons. You can google for the instructions for passing the environment variable to xcodebuild, here is <a href="http://blog.manbolo.com/2013/05/17/passing-user-variable-to-xcodebuild" rel="nofollow">one link</a> that describes it well. With this environment variable you can create a new build phase (Select your target, click Editor->Add Build Phase->Add Run Script Build Phase). Write a script that will copy the icon files if the environment variable exists.</p>
