<p>This is because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing"><em>object slicing</em></a>: the abstract class received by value will receive a copy of the object that you are passing; therefore, the derived data members will be sliced off from it, making the object unusable.</p>

<p>When you pass by reference, you are passing the address of the existing object, which is a member of a derived class, all its data members included. This is not specific to C++ - this is a property of passing by value in general.</p>

<p>The dynamic binding is implemented in such a way as to not allow sliced instance receive calls as if it were a complete instance. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">vtable</a> pointer is adjusted to dispatch the calls to the member functions of the abstract base class.</p>
