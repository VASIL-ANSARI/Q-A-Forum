<p>You should look into ASP.NET <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr" rel="nofollow">SignalR</a> which allows you to do real time updates to your page.</p>

<p>Basically your browser will make a connection to your hub and whenever you add a new book, your code should invoke your client side method with the new book information in JSON format or so, so that you can update your UI with that.</p>

<p>SignalR will use WebSockets under the covers when it's available, and gracefully fallback to other techniques like long polling using javascript setInterval</p>
