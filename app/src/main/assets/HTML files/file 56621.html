<p>When you create a class in object oriented languages such as the Objective C, the mechanisms of abstractions need to conform to a governing architecture as <a href="http://objc.toodarkpark.net/oop.html#903" rel="nofollow">explained at this tutorial</a>. I would check and make sure the way you created the "manager" class is consistent with such properties.</p>
