<p>I think the easiest way is to write it to the disk and delete it afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>Document document = new Document();
File f= new File("C:\\delete.pdf");  //for instance
PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream(f));
document.open();
document.add(page);
document.close();
long filesize = f.length();   //this is the filesize in byte
f.delete();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not absolutely sure, I admit, but I don't know how it should be possible to figure out the filesize if the file is not existing.</p>
