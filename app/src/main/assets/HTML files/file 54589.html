<p>Float does not have enough precision to encode exactly this number.
If you used double, it would work:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {

    public static void main(final String args[]) {
        long l1 = 6788819226L;
        double f1 = l1;
        long l2 = (long) f1;
        System.out.println("Input long::" + l1);
        System.out.println("Double value::" + f1);
        System.out.println("Typecasted value::" + l2);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Input long::6788819226
Double value::6.788819226E9
Typecasted value::6788819226
</code></pre>

<p>You can read <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3</a> to understand the exact limitations of float.
To give an approximation, integer up to 2^24 will be exactly saved in float, after that it can be an approximation (or exact, depending on the number). For doubles, this goes up to 2^53.</p>

<p>The reason your first example works exactly is because 8589934592 is a power of 2, for which the approximation is equal to the number (if you read the specification you will understand this).</p>
