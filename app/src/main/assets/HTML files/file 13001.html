<p>There are a few things I see that are wrong with your code:</p>

<ol>
<li>you are checking if the val is equal to "Email [Required] and empty string..this is invalid because they can't be both of those at the same time. </li>
<li><p>In the email test, you need to test against email.val() not the jquery selector</p>

<p><code>(!reEmail.test(email))</code> should be <code>(!reEmail.test(email.val()))</code></p></li>
</ol>
