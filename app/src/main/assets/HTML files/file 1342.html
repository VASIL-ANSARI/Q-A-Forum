<p>I figured this out - the answer is embarrassingly simple. With an emphasis on "embarrassing".</p>

<p>If you use something like NSString's writeToFile methods, all you need to do is think of your path as relative to wherever you're running xcodebuild from - no NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains needed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>(if running in ~/src/awesomeapp)</p>

<pre><code>[myString writeToFile:@"awesome.file" atomically:YES encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>Will output to:
~/src/awesomeapp/awesome.file</p>

<p>Yes, I am an idiot. I actually tried this <em>first</em>, but I was attempting to write to a relative directory that didn't exist, thus resulting in an unhelpful "Cannot do this" style error that led me all around the internets and eventually to stackoverflow... (you need to use FileManager#createDirectoryAtPath! There is no automatic path creation, unfortunately.)</p>

<p>FYI, as should be apparent, you are free to write files wherever you wish on your hard drive when running via xcodebuild - no sandboxing occurs. If you run in the simulator, though, it might be a different story.</p>
