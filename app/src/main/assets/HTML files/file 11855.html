<p>To do this, if you use regular multipart/form-data form post, you'll need to have code on the server-side; one that can feed-back progress to the JavaScript running in the clients' browsers. Take a look <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849237/upload-progress-bar-in-php">at this previously asked question</a>. Alternatively you might use Flash (but you probably don't want to) or HTML 5. You can take a look at that question and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/76976/how-to-get-progress-from-xmlhttprequest">this question concerning XMLHTTPRequests</a>. </p>
