<p>Your C program has several issues.</p>

<p>You don't declare all the variables you are using, for example, and there's no need for them to be global.</p>

<p>Your initial value for sum2 (0) is wrong, it will never update because you repetedly multiply k times 0.</p>

<p>Then in <code>pow(..., 1 / n)</code> the 1/n is an integer division, so you are elevating to 0.</p>

<p>Your loop and its condition must be modified. Try this, I used double, instead of integers and float, but it depends on your assignment:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define MAX 80

int main()
{
    double a, g, h, k;
    double sum = 0, prod = 1, sum_inv = 0;
    const int n = 5;
    int i = 0;

    printf("Please, enter five numbers:\n");

    char buffer[MAX];
    while ( i &lt; n ) {
        fgets(buffer, MAX, stdin);
        if ( sscanf(buffer, "%lf", &amp;k) != 1 ) {
            printf("Wrong format, floating point number expected\n");
            continue;
        }
        if ( k == 0.0 ) {
            printf("You should enter non zero numbers\n");
            continue;
        }
        ++i;
        sum += k;
        prod *= k;
        sum_inv += (1.0 / k);
    }

    a = sum / n;
    g = pow(prod, 1.0 / n);
    h = n / sum_inv;

    printf("Arithmetic mean: %.3f\n", a);
    printf("Geometric mean: %.3f\n", g);
    printf("Harmonic mean: %.3f\n", h);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
