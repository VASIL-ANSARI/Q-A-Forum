<p>The docs you linked to explain this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calling save_m2m() is only required if you use save(commit=False). When you use a simple save() on a form, all data â including many-to-many data â is saved without the need for any additional method calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it looks like <code>event</code> is itself a model instance rather than a form. <code>save_m2m</code> is required for forms, not model instances.</p>

<p>To paraphrase the explanation in the docs: a form's <code>save</code> method, if called with <code>commit=True</code> (the default) does two things - it creates a new model instance using the form's cleaned data, and it writes that model instance to the database. Then, if there are any many-to-many relationships, it writes those to the database as well. It does that after writing the instance because you can't write a many-to-many relationship until the instance has a primary key, which is auto-generated when you write it to the database.</p>

<p>If you call the form's <code>save</code> method with <code>commit=False</code>, it creates the new model instance but it does not write it to the database. Thus, it has no primary key yet and the many-to-many information can't be saved either. After you save the model instance and therefore generate a primary key for it, the many-to-many information is still stored only in the form object. So you need to notify the form object that it's now OK to save the many-to-many information, by calling <code>save_m2m</code>.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> Since you've added more of your code I can see more clearly what you're asking. The above code will not save many-to-many relationships that are set in your <code>EventForm</code> instance. Is that what your loop to set opportunities is doing?</p>
