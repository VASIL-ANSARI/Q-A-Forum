<p>I think you are using the live editing with VS2013. If you using VS2013 just as an HTML editor then its an overkill. VS2013 comes with a publishing wizard where you can setup the publish settings and publish your changes to the remote server.</p>

<p>In most cases remote editing is not good, but for minor cosmetic changes you can use live edit.</p>
