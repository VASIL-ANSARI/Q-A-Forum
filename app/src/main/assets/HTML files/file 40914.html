<p>You could join your table with a numbers table, to split all digits into rows, then sum odds and even position digits separately. </p>

<pre><code>with positions(position) as 
    (select level from dual connect by level &lt;=25
    ),
digits as
    (
    select 
        t1.v,
        n.position ,
        cast(substr(t1.v ,length(t1.v) - n.position + 1, 1) as int) as digit
    from my_table t1 left join positions n
    on n.position &lt;= length(t1.v)
    )
select
    v,
    sum(case when mod(position,2)=0 then digit else 0 end) as evensum,
    sum(case when mod(position,2)=1 then digit else 0 end) as oddsum
from
    digits
group by
    v
</code></pre>

<p>Test <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/9bb06/5" rel="nofollow">Sql Fiddle</a>, the result:</p>

<pre><code>V           EVENSUM ODDSUM
440065385   17      18
</code></pre>
