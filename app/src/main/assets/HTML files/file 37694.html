<p><code>When i tried to get my RelativeLayout, null is return : RelativeLayout rl = (RelativeLayout) gridCat.getChildAt(gridCat.getCount()-1);</code></p>

<p>I think your answer is this:</p>

<p>when you add </p>

<pre><code>  subcatList.add(new SubCategory());
  adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
</code></pre>

<p>to your code it is not guaranteed that new view for them has been created, because it is possible that your gridView has 100 children and you are just looking at children from 7 to 20 , so new child at index 100 has not yet inflated because the getView is called upon request in order to save memory so when there is no need to show the 100th child, why it must be called? so relativelayout for that child is null because it has not inflated.</p>

<p>in catAddButton  listener you must not touch any gridview item, because when the button click happens it first runs your listener then scrolls to the end of gridView so still you have problem, what sholud you do? </p>

<p>in class of SubCategory() put variable that indicates it has not shown for the first time. in getView of gridview each time you want to inflate new items look at that variable (in the list of your SubCategory at item list.get(position))  and for example if it is boolean toggle it to false so that means the new object is going to be seen by user. So in this way each time you are going to inflate the view you know that if it is the first time or not, if it is first time your boolean is true else it has already been false. if it is not first time remove focus else put focus by calling reqesFocuse.</p>
