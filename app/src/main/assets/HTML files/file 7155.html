<p>Add a script in the head (after css is included) that opens the lightbox. Last in the body add a script (preferably with an event handler to know that the dom actually is ready) that closes the lightbox :)</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    //close lightbox
}, false);
</code></pre>
