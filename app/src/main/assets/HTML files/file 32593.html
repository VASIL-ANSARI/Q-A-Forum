<p>For future readers...</p>

<p>I've ran into this problem before with namespaced models. With polymorphic relationships, Laravel is storing the XXX-able_id and XXX-able_type in the table. The XXX-able_type is generally the <em>fully qualified name of the model</em>, not just the class name. So, in this case, you'll need to check that the value in that column is indeed <code>Admin\User</code> and not just <code>User</code>. </p>

<p>In your case, remigrating simply caused the models to get inserted with their fully-qualified name, rather than just the class name.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
