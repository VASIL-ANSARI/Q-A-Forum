<p>I previously posted a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12461905/string-length-limitation-for-rich-text-editor">similar question</a>. The answer is that you really shouldn't limit the length on rich text editors. HTML is generated on the fly by the rich text editor so you can't really limit what is being input. You could technically constrain the length of the output HTML, but doing so would likely result in malformed HTML that wouldn't run/render correctly. While this may seem a non-answer, you'd be better off not constraining the input but instead making sure you can handle it on the back end, if saving to a database, etc.</p>
