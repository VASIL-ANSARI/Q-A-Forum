<p>I think I am a bit lost and I hope this silly mistake could help someone else get to the answer.
What I have done is simply get the source code here : <a href="http://expressionblend.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest/" rel="nofollow" title="Source code of Expression Blend Samples">Source code of Expression Blend Samples</a>.
From there, I simply <strong>imported the classes</strong> in which I was interested and changed the Framework built to 4.5. Controls and Behaviors magically appeared in Blend and I was able to use the classes fully. 
Anyway, sorry for the bother.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> I have another trick that might help someone. I had changed the target CPU to x64, which is why I did not see the prope design in Blend. Changing it back to x32 helped me see the design. </p>
