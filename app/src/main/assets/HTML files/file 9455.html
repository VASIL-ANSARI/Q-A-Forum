<p>As you probably have found, this is a <a href="http://forum.jquery.com/topic/temporary-fix-for-ie-fadein-fadeout-fadeto-bug-not-working" rel="nofollow">common bug</a> in IE.  One solution would be to wrap the faded element in an absolutely positioned element and have the faded element display inline-block.  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Ayy6W/14/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s the updated fiddle that uses this method.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Another option based on your comment is to do just that:  iterate over the different elements you want to fade in.  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/briguy37/Ayy6W/28/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an example where you add the <code>fadeIn</code> class to each element and then iterate over them individually.  In that case, the javascript would be as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>$("#hello .fadeIn").each(function(){
    $(this).hide();
    $(this).fadeIn();
});
</code></pre>
