<p>If the <code>&lt;loner&gt;</code> element in your sample XML didn't have the <code>xmlns</code> default namespace declaration on it, then it would be in the <code>whatever:name-space-1.0</code> namespace rather than being in no namespace. If that's what you want, you need to create the element in that namespace:</p>

<pre><code>xml.CreateElement("loner", "whatever:name-space-1.0")
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the <code>&lt;loner&gt;</code> element to be in no namespace, then the XML that's been produced is exactly what you need, and you shouldn't worry about the <code>xmlns</code> attribute that's been added automatically for you.</p>
