<p>You could do somthing like this with QPainter for a simple alpha blending. This code can be easily adjusted to something else as well:</p>

<pre><code>QImage surface(...);
QPainter p(&amp;surface);
p.setCompositionMode(QPainter::CompositionMode_Source);
// p.setBrush(LinearGradient from solid to transparent right to left)
p.drawRect(surface.size());
p.setCompositionMode(QPainter::CompositionMode_DestinationIn);
p.drawImage(image1);
p.end();
p.begin(image2);
p.drawImage(surface);
p.end();
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtgui/qpainter.html#CompositionMode-enum" rel="nofollow">useful part</a> of the documentation with illustration visually.</p>

<p>If you used OpenGL shaders, this would be much simpler though as opengl has some support for this off-hand. I would recommend to consider switching to that in the future unless you are on a limited platform.</p>

<p>Note, there is also some alpha channel support for QImages, but this is probably not the best to use in here, so take it as "out-of-curiosity":</p>

<pre><code>QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied 
</code></pre>
