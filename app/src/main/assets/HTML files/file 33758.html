<p>First of all 'GET' is the better alternative since you are not passing any params to your DB. </p>

<p>Secondly on which port is your application running? You are adding 8080 to your request which lets me assume your app is running under a different port. JS is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" rel="nofollow">Same Origin Policy</a> that means if you want to access data from a different URL (different port = different url) it won't give you any repsponse data.</p>

<p>To make this work either make sure the python script is passing the information to your application directly or you have to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" rel="nofollow">Cross Origin Ressource Sharing</a>.
To do this you have to add a header to the response of your python (port 8080) script with the following content </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: localhost:XXXX //replace XXXX with your application port</p>
</blockquote>
