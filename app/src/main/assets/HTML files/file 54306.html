<p>Regarding interpretation.
Either come up with your own language (using bison/flex for instance, <a href="http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/" rel="nofollow">have a look at an example</a>) or embed an existing interpreted language, such as python or lua <a href="https://csl.name/post/lua-and-cpp/" rel="nofollow">(a random example</a>).</p>

<p>I've successfully implemented lua as a replacement for a real GUI in some of my own projects and can recommend it, however if you'd like to do some real symbolic math, you'd probably need to come up with a language of your own.</p>

<p>Also have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10461089/parsing-math-equations">Parsing math equations</a> regarding parsing math equations.</p>
