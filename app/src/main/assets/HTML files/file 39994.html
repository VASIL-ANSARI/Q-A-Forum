<p>The proper Object-Oriented way to do this is to have a container you're putting the orders into. This can be a plain-old array or a special container class.</p>

<p>The big problem here is you don't have a proper context for storing the "all orders" data. All orders relevant to what? The entire application? If that's the case you need the concept of an order book or a database to store them.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class OrderBook &lt; Array
end

order_book = OrderBook.new
order_book &lt;&lt; Order.new(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I've renamed <code>Orders</code> to <code>Order</code> as that's more accurate, singular name.</p>

<p>Auto-<em>magically</em> adding instances to a container is almost always a recipe for disaster. That sort of thing should be handled using a design pattern like <em>model-controller</em>. It's a huge assumption that you'd want to include it in the global orders pool.</p>
