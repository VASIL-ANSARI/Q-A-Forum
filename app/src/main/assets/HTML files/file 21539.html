<p>Well the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.idispatchmessageinspector.aspx" rel="nofollow">IDispatchMessageInspector</a> interface receives a IClientChannel on each call, which is in turn an IExtensible. You would have to implement an custom <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms586703.aspx" rel="nofollow">IExtension</a>, and extend the client channel when it's initialized (using an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.ichannelinitializer.aspx" rel="nofollow">IChannelInitializer</a> implementation). You could then retrieve the extension from the channel parameter in the inspector method implementation, and use it as a means of communication with you front end..</p>
