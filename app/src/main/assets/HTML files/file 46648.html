<p>The session variable will only be active as long as the user doesn't close the browser. </p>

<p>So if you're trying to echo <code>$_SESSION["avatar"]</code> it will work when the user just uploaded the avatar and surfs around on your page. When they leave and come back later, the session has been cleared. Furthermore, the session is only between the current user and the webserver and the avatar will only be displayed for the user itself, and not anyone else on your site!</p>

<p><strong>It will therefore not be the ideal solution to load the image from session!</strong></p>

<p>Every time a user visits your page you need to load their information from your database (including the avatar path) and display it directly from there.</p>
