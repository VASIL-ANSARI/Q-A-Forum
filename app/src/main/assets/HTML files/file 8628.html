<p>YouTube Videos take a second or two to initiate. When the css changes from <code>display:none</code> to <code>display:block</code> or similar. A fix for this would be to make a modification to the plugin or your own plugin which makes use of <code>visibility:hidden</code> and <code>visibility:visible</code> instead.</p>

<p>I have encountered your problem before when making a YouTube cycle, using the cycle plugin.
I decided it didn't matter so much so I left it as it was.</p>
