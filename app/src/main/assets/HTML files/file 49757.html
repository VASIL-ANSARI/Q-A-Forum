<p>In your example, you are adding the functions <code>getSalaryFunction</code> and <code>addSalaryFunction</code> to the global (or at least outer) scope, where they can be called independently (and probably return undefined.)</p>

<p>In the original example, the functions only exist as part of their parent object, so they are more likely to do the right thing* when called.</p>

<p>* I'm hand-waving over the complexities of <code>this</code> in JS.</p>
