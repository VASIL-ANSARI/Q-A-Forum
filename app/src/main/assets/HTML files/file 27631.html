<p>If you download <code>XML</code>, parse it in the database. Why do you need to 'replace' it? (You can do this but it's not the best solution).</p>

<p>What you should do is download the <code>XML</code> into memory (for example <code>HttpClient</code> or any other), parse the <code>XML</code> and directly insert into the database. </p>

<p>This means you don't need to save anything.</p>
