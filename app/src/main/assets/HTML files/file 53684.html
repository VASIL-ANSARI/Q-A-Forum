<p>So the issue is caused by the fact that USA and SPAIN contain the same value. ASP.NET doesn't actually get the selected index of the clicked item in the ListBox. Instead, it uses the value that you selected to determine the index. And because USA and SPAIN have the same value, it chooses the first index that contains that value.</p>

<p>Instead of using Response.Write to get the selected index of the ListItem, I would put a label on the page and set its visibility to false.</p>

<p>Then, in the SelectedIndexChanged event, set the text of the label to the selected index of the ListBox.</p>

<pre><code>protected void ListBox1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Label1.Text = ListBox1.SelectedIndex.ToString();
}
</code></pre>
