<p>You can specify the current ANSI encoding for the system:</p>

<pre><code>var rdr = new StreamReader(stream.AsStream(), System.Text.Encoding.Default);
</code></pre>

<p>If that is not the correct encoding for the file, then you need to know which encoding was used on the computer where the file was created, and get that encoding to decode it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var rdr = new StreamReader(stream.AsStream(), System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding("ibm850"));
</code></pre>
