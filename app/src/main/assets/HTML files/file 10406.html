<pre><code>- (void) scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
</code></pre>

<p>Is called many times during a single scroll, at very short time intervals, you don't want to be calling <code>[soundScroll play];</code> every time this callback occurs, instead use this callback</p>

<pre><code>- (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
</code></pre>

<p>so that the sound is played once when the scrolling starts, or either of these</p>

<pre><code>- (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate
- (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
</code></pre>

<p>if you want the sound the play after the user scrolls. If you want a short sound to be looping continuously through the scroll you can set the <code>AVAudioPlayer</code> numberOfLoops property to a negative value so that it loops indefinately, then stop it when the scrolling stops.</p>
