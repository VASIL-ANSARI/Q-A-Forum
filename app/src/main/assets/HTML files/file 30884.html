<p>Factory Data Reset removes user data, third party applications, and returns your phone to the condition it was when shipped from the factory. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When performing a factory reset:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>/system is untouched since it's normally read-only anyway
  /data is formatted</li>
  <li>/cache is formatted</li>
  <li>/sdcard is not touched unless you specify. Note that apps on the sdcard will still be erased.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>So, to answer your question, the system is not reflash end, but instead the data and cache partitions are formatted.</p>
