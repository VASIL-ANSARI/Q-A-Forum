<p>I think this happens because the time that a while loop executes is 40 ms (your sleep) + the time necessary to execute the code that builds the packet.</p>

<p>Have you tried using a System.Threading.Timer ? This way your code will execute in a separate thread then the one that is counting your time. However, I don't think the performance is good enough to keep your real time application running for long.</p>
