<p>What SKU of Visual Studio are you using (Express, Standard, Pro, Ultimate)?  Device development is only available in Professional or better, IIRC (it changed with every version of Studio).  If you have the proper SKU, you also have to ensure device development support was installed (it can be unchecked during install).  If both of those are true, then check to see if the file indicated exists - if not I'd do a repair or reinstall of Studio.</p>
