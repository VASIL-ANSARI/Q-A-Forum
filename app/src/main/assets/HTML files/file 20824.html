<p>You need a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> against a subquery for each <code>levN</code> column, which returns the distinct level, and count for that column. They all then get added up and joined to <code>user_id</code>.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  DISTINCT
  user_id,
  /* COALESCE() is needed so NULLs don't ruin the calculation */
  COALESCE(l1count, 0) +
  COALESCE(l2count, 0) +
  COALESCE(l3count, 0) +
  COALESCE(l4count, 0) AS children
FROM
  yourtable
  /* a left join individually against each of the `levN` columns to get the count per value of each */
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT lev1, COUNT(*) AS l1count FROM yourtable GROUP BY lev1) l1 ON yourtable.user_id = l1.lev1
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT lev2, COUNT(*) AS l2count FROM yourtable GROUP BY lev2) l2 ON yourtable.user_id = l2.lev2
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT lev3, COUNT(*) AS l3count FROM yourtable GROUP BY lev3) l3 ON yourtable.user_id = l3.lev3
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT lev4, COUNT(*) AS l4count FROM yourtable GROUP BY lev4) l4 ON yourtable.user_id = l4.lev4
</code></pre>
