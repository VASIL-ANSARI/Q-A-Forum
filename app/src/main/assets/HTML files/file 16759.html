<p>You did not mention whether you are just trying to understand, or whether apktool simply failed to decompile an APK for you. If the later, I wrote a "competing" tool called <a href="https://github.com/Shachar/Lingnu-Android-Tools" rel="nofollow">zzos</a>, which might just work better for you.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the format, please understand that Android contains more than one floating point format. Floating points are sometimes stores as IEEE standard format, but sometimes they are stored in other, almost fixed point, formats. The precise meaning of the "doubles" you quote really depends on where they are taken from, and how they were encoded.</p>

<p>The simplest way to try and understand those is to run "aapt d --values resources <i>apkfile</i>" over your APK, and search there for the values. If you paste the relevant part of the result here, we can try and help you understand exactly what is going on, and I can try to point you to the right place that encodes there.</p>
