<p>I think what you're referring to is the fact that you can't extend an array class and hence can't add a method to it:</p>

<pre><code>// No way to do this
int[] array;
array.myMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>This means your only option is to make a static helper method somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>// So you have to do this
int[] array;
Utils.myMethod(array);

class Utils {
    static void myMethod(int[] array) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>An example of this is the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Arrays</code></a> class, which has lots of static methods for operating on arrays. Conceptually it would be clearer if these methods could be added to the array classes, but you can't do that in Java (you can in other languages like Javascript).</p>
