<ol>
<li><p>The Angular docuumentation on creating customer filters says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This factory function should return a new filter function which takes the input value as the first argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that Angular will supply the input value to the function as the <code>value</code> argument, since it's the first argument.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any filter arguments are passed in as additional arguments to the filter function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the HTML doesn't have to deal with leaving a place for the first argument, Angular takes care of providing them in the appropriate order.</p></li>
<li><p>It's like most Javascript functions, you have to know the order of arguments to call them properly. Developers generally guarantee that they won't change the order incompatibly. Additional arguments can be added at the end of the argument list; the function has to default them appropriately if not supplied (JS automatically sets them to <code>undefined</code>).</p></li>
