<p>Actually this a traditional issue in what has been recognized in crypto as best done with what is called static factory methods - usually named <code>getInstance()</code> - in which you refactor a lot of the question into one place.
It gets rather nasty trying to wade through all the responses you get but never throw away exceptions by doing nothing at all, just simplify greatly for end-use-case and either keep something in a log and fail-fast or make sure you are in a student setting. </p>
