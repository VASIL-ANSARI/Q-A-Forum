<p>That is caused by a bug in gradle that doesn't propagate that.. There is no trivial work around for that, and the gradle folks say it is non-trivial to fix it. What I personally do in my local repo is that I add "true ||" to the if-clause of the LOGD block to get that working in my local repo. Here is a reference to the bug: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=52962" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=52962</a></p>
