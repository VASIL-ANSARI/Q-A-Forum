<p>Since the value is already a <code>str</code>, all you have to do is open the file in binary mode and <code>.write()</code> it:</p>

<pre><code>with file('name.bin', 'wb') as f: # 'w' for writing, 'b' for binary
    f.write(d['key_1'])
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to re-interpret the text as actually being some kind of hex dump, or something else, then you'll have to be more specific.</p>
