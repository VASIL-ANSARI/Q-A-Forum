<p>A mutex synchronizes access by virtue of only being held by a single thread at any given time. Your code will prevent multiple instances of <code>FileWriter.CreatePDFFile()</code> from executing at the same time.</p>

<p>Because it uses a <em>named</em> mutex it will also synchronize access across processes on the system, e.g. all instances of all applications that use the <code>FileWriter</code> class.</p>

<p>Your description of the simulation is confusing. The mutex will have no effect if you are only running one process that uses the class, and that process has only a single thread.</p>
