<p><strong>I've managed to solve this by implementing a similar, yet functioning version of Boost.Any and then implementing a binding by instantiating the function not in the actual set_function, but in the set_function("NAME", function);</strong></p>

<p>This results in a correctly-functioning system in which I can create Any objects in C++ and pass them to Lua, or I can create Any objects in Lua and then pass them to C++. As long as I correctly define how to interface the types back and forth, I am able to unpack and pack data in and out of both C++ and Lua. Together, this creates a great system that allows for easy extension of types that can be exposed to scripting.</p>

<p>I believe I have reached my goal for now, and am interested in any additional thoughts that may come from this.</p>
