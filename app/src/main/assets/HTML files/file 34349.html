<p>You can, you don't want to.  If you send a text message, it will appear in the user's messaging app.  That would be a bad user experience.  Also many users pay per sms message at obscene rates (compared to data)-  they won't appreciate it at all.</p>

<p>Also, remember that SMS is limited to 160 bytes per message, messages may not be received in order, and may not be received for hours (or never).  So you need to account for all of those facts when you write both the sending and receiving side.  So its very limiting.</p>

<p>If you do decide to do this, use port based sms.  That way it may not appear in the regular text messaging app.</p>
