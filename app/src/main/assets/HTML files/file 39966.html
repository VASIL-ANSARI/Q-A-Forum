<p>You probably need a sub-query based on your criteria which is unclear at this point.  MAX() is typically based on an aggregate and not what you have.  Without knowing more, your query probably needs to be something like...</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE transactions 
   SET proposal = 1 + ( select MAX(proposal) from transactions where SomeCondition )
   WHERE id = 1054 
</code></pre>

<p>So the inner select MAX() is getting a proposal amount from the transaction table, but I don't know what your criteria is that you need.  If the transaction table has many records with id = 1054, then your inner "SomeCondition" would also be... "id = 1054".</p>

<p>if you are trying to compare to another transaction and want the highest, then adjust as needed.</p>
