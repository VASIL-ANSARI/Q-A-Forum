<p>If the column is defined in a table/view, you can use it in <code>ORDER BY</code> and omit it from results. But in your case, you are using <em>calculated columns</em> in <code>ORDER BY</code>, so if you want to omit these columns, you have to replace them in <code>ORDER BY</code> with corresponding formula, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE WHEN (`name` = "John Smith") = 1 THEN (`name` = "John Smith") END DESC
    -- etc...
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is not a good solution. Instead, It's better to use subquery:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO relational (class_id, teacher_id, student_id)
SELECT id,1,1 FROM
    (SELECT `id`,
        (`name` = "John Smith") as exact_score,
        (`name` RLIKE "[[:&lt;:]]John Smith[[:&gt;:]]") as reg_score,
        (MATCH (`name`) AGAINST ("John Smith")) as match_score
    FROM `teachers`
    WHERE (`title` RLIKE "[[:&lt;:]]John Smith[[:&gt;:]]" || MATCH (`title`) AGAINST ("John Smith"))
    ORDER BY
        CASE WHEN exact_score = 1 THEN exact_score END DESC,
        CASE WHEN reg_score &gt; 1 THEN reg_score END DESC,
        CASE WHEN reg_score = 0 AND exact_score = 0 THEN match_score END DESC)
    AS t1;
</code></pre>
