<p>You'll want to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162610%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">EnumDisplayMonitors</a> function, which calls a callback for each monitor and passes the rectangle and a device context (which includes the colour information).</p>

<p>pywin32 has <a href="http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.6/pywin32/win32api__EnumDisplayMonitors_meth.html" rel="nofollow">win32api.EnumDisplayMonitors</a>, which appears to use EnumDisplayMonitors under the covers to return a list with the same details as I mentioned above.</p>
