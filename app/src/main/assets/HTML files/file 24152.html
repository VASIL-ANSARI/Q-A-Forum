<p>associated products requires a "configurable" or a "grouped" product type that will have then "simple" products associated to it.</p>

<p>If your products are already compatible with this, then magmi configurable plugin (in case of configurable) or magmi grouped plugin (in case of grouped) could do the thing easily at import.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fill <code>simples_skus</code> column with the skus to "associate" with your master product in case of configurable product. Forc configurable products, you'll also need "pivot" attributes that will constitute the "variations" you want to express on your master product and that will be implemented by each of your simple products.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill <code>grouped_skus</code> columns with the skus to "associate" with your master product in case of grouped product.No need for pivot attributes since a grouped product is a "bag of product"</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then for removing related products, use the <code>re_skus</code> column , and fill it with <code>-re::.*</code> , which mean remove all related skus matching regexp: <code>.*</code> , => "everything"</p>
