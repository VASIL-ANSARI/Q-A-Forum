<p>I don't know what issue you're having exactly, but I have an idea.
One issue may be the word that you provide is not in the dictionary. That could cause a <code>KeyNotFoundException</code>. A simple fix would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>if(Dict.ContainsKey(word)){
    Console.WriteLine(Dict[word]);
} else {
    Console.WriteLine(0); //Or whatever you deem appropriate
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other issue you may have is that the <code>foreach(var item in Dict)</code>.  Dictionaries iterate over the pairs of elements. The variable <code>item</code> has an inferred type of <code>KeyValuePair&lt;string,int&gt;</code> and <code>Console.WriteLine(item);</code> may not be printing what you expect.  Try replacing <code>Console.WriteLine(item)</code> with <code>Console.WriteLine(item.Key + " " +item.Value);</code></p>
