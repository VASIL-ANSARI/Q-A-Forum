<p>Orion's Go language plug-in provides a straight-forward example of contributing content assist via a plugin, see <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/orion/org.eclipse.orion.client.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.orion.client.ui/web/plugins/languages/go?id=R7_0" rel="nofollow">http://git.eclipse.org/c/orion/org.eclipse.orion.client.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.orion.client.ui/web/plugins/languages/go?id=R7_0</a> .  To make something similar for PHP you would create a plug-in with the same shape that defines at least the "orion.edit.contentAssist" service, and then install it in your Orion/WebIDE on its Settings-Plugins page (point it at your plugin's .html file).</p>
