<p>Subclassing UINavigationController or UITabBarController is an excellent way to handle device rotation issues, but I wouldn't recommend doing that specifically to share subviews from multiple view controllers.</p>

<p>Maybe subclassing UIViewController is what you're looking for.  Then when the view has loaded, you can load your shared views from a nib and define the outlets in your UIViewController subclass, plus add any supporting code to your subclass for handling the events.  I've done this myself for adding a status update message that I want to be able to appear on any of my view controllers' views.</p>
