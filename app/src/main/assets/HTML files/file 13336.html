<p>You can create <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/event/" rel="nofollow">event</a> using <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" rel="nofollow">Graph API</a>: send POST request. I try with parameters: name, start_time, end_time, description, privacy_type.
If I right understood requered params only name and start_time. If you not set end_time, it will be equal start_time + 3h. By default privacy is OPEN.
But I not understood, what you want from event_info?
You can add to POST field location. Or you want send extend information with facebook object as some place (as in Graph API venue)?</p>
