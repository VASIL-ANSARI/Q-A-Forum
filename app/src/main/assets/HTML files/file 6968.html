<p>One other option could be to run the PHP CLI script as a daemon (good blog post on this <a href="http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/create_daemons_in_php/" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<p>If the script has a particularly long startup/cleanup, then running it as a daemon would mean that you only do this once.</p>

<p>The downside is that you'd need to write a way of communicating with that daemon, to get the data from C# to it.  You'd also need to keep an eye out on its memory usage over time.</p>

<p>The best method is always going to be specific to your script though.</p>
