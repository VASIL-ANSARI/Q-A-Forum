<p>I think Dynamic LINQ will be one of option. DLINQ allows you to specify part of the LINQ query as "string" and DLINQ then compiles that string to Expression tree so that be passed to the underlying LINQ provider. Your need is also same i.e you need to create Expression trees at runtime. </p>

<p>I would suggest you to make the property <code>Operator</code> in <code>FieldCriteria</code> as an <code>Enum</code> which represent all the required operations (equals, less then etc). Then you will need to write a function that takes a list of <code>FieldCriteria</code> and return a "expression" string which then can be fed into DLINQ to get the expression tree.</p>
