<p>Why not put only the statements that should be repeated inside a loop?</p>

<pre><code>String redo;
do{
    System.out.println("Would you like to do another calculation?");
    redo = input.nextLine();

    if(redo.equals("yes"))
        theMath();
    else if(redo.equals("no"))
        System.out.println("Thanks for calculating with me! It certainly was fun!");
    else
        System.out.println("Please enter 'yes' or 'no' only.");
        String yesNo = input.nextLine();
    if(yesNo.equals("yes"))
            theMath();
    else
        System.out.println("Thanks for calculating with me! It certainly was fun!");
}while(redo.equals("yes"))
</code></pre>

<p>As for the other part of your question. If you have two int values and want to get a decimal from a division, you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 2;
int y = 3;
double result = (double)x/y;
System.out.println(result);
</code></pre>

<p>This is called casting.</p>
