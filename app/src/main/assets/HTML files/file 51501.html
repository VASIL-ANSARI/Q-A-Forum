<p>There's no way to handle the timeout if you are using window.location.href to trigger the request</p>

<p>This is how you could do your request as an ajax request with jquery:</p>

<pre><code>$.get("url for request").done(function(htmlReturned) {
  //do whatever you like here on success, even window.location.href
}).fail(function(jqXhr, statusText, errorThrown){
   //handle failure here
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use $.post if you need to perform a post request. If you need to pass some parameters in the request you can do it this way <code>$.get(url, {param1: "value1", param2: "value2"});</code></p>

<p>If you haven't done this before, the best resource is the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">ajax page from jquery documentation</a> ($.get and $.post is just shorthand for ways of calling $.ajax).</p>
