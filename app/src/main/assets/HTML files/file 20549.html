<p>It appears that your IDE (which you do not name) is telling you it is trying to display a line from the RXTXcom library, but it has no source code to use to do so.  I would expect this if I were using eclipse, had a binary-only copy of the library, exception checking turned on in the debugger, and the library threw an exception.</p>

<p>I don't recognize "resume debug - new window", so I don't know what effect that might have.</p>

<p>Eclipse has a "step out" function in its debugger, allowing you to step through the next return statement; that might help you get to a level for which you do have source.</p>

<p>I doubt this message has much to do with your actual 1 byte vs. byte array reading problem.</p>
