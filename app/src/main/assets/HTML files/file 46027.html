<p>Replace your current query string </p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'UPDATE shops SET is_open = isOpen WHERE shop_id=shop_id'
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>$sql = "UPDATE shops SET is_open = '$isOpen' WHERE shop_id='$shop_id'"
</code></pre>

<p>PHP can then replace the variables in your string by the values that you set before.</p>

<p><strong>Anyways, using the mysql API is deprecated and in the way you do it, also unsafe. Use PDO or mysqli in combination with prepared statements instead.</strong></p>
