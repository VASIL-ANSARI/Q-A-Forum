<p>My guess is that the images are correctly being displayed as they are stored but they have EXIF data saying that the orientation should be rotated 90 degrees.  If you're building your app for Android 2.0 and above, take a look at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface.html" rel="nofollow">ExifInterface</a> class.  If you're targeting earlier versions of Android, take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2536194/android-image-exif-reader-3rd-party-api/2571105#2571105">this answer</a>.</p>
