<p>For issue 1, I believe you are trying to "instance" the ASP application class from the WCF service. Like loading the DLL on your own or something that way. Do not do it - it will always make the statics null and sessions null. You need a invert the control here. Create a callback and this thing could work like a charm. </p>

<p>Why dont you look at options like SSE (Server Sent Events) ? Probably that can solve the issue you have with your point 2. </p>

<p>Post your code if possible.</p>
