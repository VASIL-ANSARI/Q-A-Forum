<p>In google analytics you can add a trigger when a specific url is reached. (Destination URL)</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>: If someone submits the contact form in magento it redirects to <a href="http://www.example.com/index.php/contacts/index/post/" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php/contacts/index/post/</a>. </p>

<p>This is how the form action will look :</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>So google analytics code will be added as it is in Admin >> System >> Configuration >> Design >> HTML Head >> Miscellaneous Scripts</strong></p>

<p>But you need to create a Goal in Google Analytics where Destination URL will be <a href="http://www.example.com/index.php/contacts/index/post/" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php/contacts/index/post/</a> </p>

<p>Note: Please use your website URL instead of example.com; this is used just for reference.</p>
