<p>CSTs (concrete syntax trees) are quite hard to work with for <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees/" rel="nofollow">some reasons</a>. Therefore they're commonly converted to ASTs (abstract syntax tree) for further processing (details in the same article). For instance, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0339/" rel="nofollow">the Python compiler</a> (the component that turns Python source code into Python VM bytecode) translates CSTs to ASTs as part of its work.</p>

<p>Now, it really does strongly depend on your final goal. What are you parsing? What do you want to do with it? If you're re-creating a classical compilation flow, converting to an AST is probably a good way to proceed. Otherwise, you may find the CST enough - it all depends on what you need.</p>
