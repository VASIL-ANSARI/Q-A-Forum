  <p><em>""it always says i cant convert int to string,"</em> - Use <code>String.valueOf(int)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably want something like this</p>

<pre><code>if (first.eqauls(String.valueOf(token)) {
    return first;
} else if (...)  {

}
return null; // if not found
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : you may also need to <code>.trim()</code> the token, depending on what the input is. If there are spaces, the tokenizer won't exclude them, so you would need to call .<code>trim()</code> on the String first before trying to compare. like</p>

<pre><code>String first = st.nextToken().trim();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it looks like you may want to use a character class, because what you're doing is looking using a single delimiter of <em>all</em> the characters, which isn't what you want. Try this instead</p>

<pre><code>StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(input, "[+-/*%]");
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In for any case you wanted the method to return an <code>int</code>, then you would need to parse the token</p>

<pre><code>int first = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Also, NOTE:</strong> Whoever gave you this assignment, ask them to read the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/StringTokenizer.html#StringTokenizer%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow">documentation for StringTokenizer</a>, where you'll find this excerpt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following example illustrates how the String.split method can be used to break up a string into its basic tokens:</p>

<pre><code>     String[] result = "this is a test".split("\\s");
     for (int x=0; x&lt;result.length; x++)
         System.out.println(result[x]);
</code></pre>
