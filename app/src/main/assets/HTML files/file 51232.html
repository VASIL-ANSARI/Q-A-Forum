<p><strong>Don't.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Why:</em></strong></p>

<p><em>cellForRowAtIndexPath</em> gets called for every cell (also during scrolling). If you are trying to do too much, it won't scroll smooth. Furthermore cells are reused (as <em>dequeue</em> indicates it). iOS only creates the number of visible cells instances plus one or two extra cells. If a cell is reused, you would need to remove the already added labels before adding new ones which leads to the next problem: How can you identify them (either search for all subviews and check if it is an instance of UILabel or use a tag and find them by tag.... anyway: If you are trying to do too much, it won't scroll smooth.</p>

<p><strong><em>Instead:</em></strong></p>

<p>Define the labels in your template cell 'DispCell' or create different template cell in your storyboard (and dequeue the correct one by name). There you can use storyboard layout constraints in order to position your labels correctly.</p>

<p>If you have a flexible number of curFlightsIda, you can either think about a max number (and hide empty labels) or maybe it works out to use a textfield instead of a label.</p>
