<p>I am not a SharePoint guy and focus mostly on REST and OData. But think that REST OData API  for SharePoint follows common rules for REST OData.</p>

<p>Common rules for REST and OData is to use different HTTP verbs for different operations. Read, create, update, and delete operations are mapped directly to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP verbs.</p>

<p>So, you are getting your user by GET HTTP verb on URI <a href="http://example.org/mytest/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/Benutzerinformationsliste(29" rel="nofollow">http://example.org/mytest/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/Benutzerinformationsliste(29</a>)</p>

<p>To delete this user use verb DELETE on the same URI and user id with empty HTTP message body.</p>

<p>To create user HTTP verb POST, same URI and json in message body. Also while creating ID shouldn't be specified (except situations when ID isn't auto-incremented in databases). Content-Type for HTTP message should be set: application/json for JSON.</p>

<p>The same situation with update - PUT, same URI
<a href="http://example.org/mytest/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/Benutzerinformationsliste(29" rel="nofollow">http://example.org/mytest/_vti_bin/listdata.svc/Benutzerinformationsliste(29</a>) </p>

<p>and json in HTTP message body with content-type:application/json.</p>

<p>Format of json should be the same as you've received.</p>

<pre><code>{    
    "InhaltstypID": "0x010A000719C31710976A48867763D86F6586E0", 
    "Name": "Rehm Rodney", 
    "Konto": "EXT\\rodney.rehm", 
    "ID": 29, 
    "Inhaltstyp": "Person", 
}
