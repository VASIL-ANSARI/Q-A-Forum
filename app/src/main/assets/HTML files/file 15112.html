<p>You have <code>Robot</code> as a subclass of <code>Map</code>; this is not how inheritance should be used. Think "subclass" rather than "child class."</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal:

    def eat(self, food):
        print "mmm"


class Human(Animal):

    def speak(self, words):
        print words
</code></pre>

<p>A human IS A animal; it can speak, but it can eat.</p>

<p>A robot is obviously not a map. I believe you are thinking of a map having robots, and it should work if you make <code>Robot</code> not a subclass. Oh, and change <code>self.robot</code> to <code>self.robots</code>.</p>
