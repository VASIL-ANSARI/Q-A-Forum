<p>I am not sure where you are actually trying to read the file. If the file you are reading is in the asset folder like /www then you cant access it using the Cordova file API. Check this link for more information. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8966227/3456790">http://stackoverflow.com/a/8966227/3456790</a></p>

<p>However, you could use a cordova plugin to read a file using native code. You could do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>AssetManager assetManager = cordova.getActivity().getAssets();
inputStream = assetManager.open("www/default/data/" + fileName + ".json" );
        if(inputStream != null) {
            buffer = new byte[inputStream.available()];
            inputStream.read(buffer);

            logger.info("Found file " + fileName);

            jsonResult  = new JSONArray(new String(buffer, "UTF-8"));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that gives you some ideas.</p>
