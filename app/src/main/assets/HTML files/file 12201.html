<p>In the case where you have complex , internal logic to a component, we often use Activity Diagrams.</p>

<p>Sequence diagrams, as you have suggested, are used for describing complex, multiple component, sequential operations, where component dependencies and the order of calls is critical for understanding.</p>

<p>However, when we want to describe the decision making from a logical perspective, which is much more often the case when dealing with a single class, Activity Diagrams are an appropriate choice.</p>
