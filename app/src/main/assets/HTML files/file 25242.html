<p><code>array_sum()</code> would return the total of all numbers in the array added, however if you want a <code>running total</code>, here go:</p>

<pre><code>$total = array();
$original = array(23, 18, 5, 8, 10, 16);

foreach($original as $number)
{
    $total[] = array_sum($total)+$number;
}

print_r($total);
</code></pre>
