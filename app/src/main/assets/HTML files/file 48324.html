<p>No.</p>

<p>The IIFE executes and returns <code>undefined</code> (since it has no return statement).</p>

<p><code>$</code> is called and the <code>undefined</code> is passed to it. The return value of <code>$</code> is then discarded because the code doesn't do anything with it.</p>

<p>The call to <code>$</code> is pointless here. All the interesting stuff happens inside the IIFE (when <code>cont.init()</code> is called).</p>
