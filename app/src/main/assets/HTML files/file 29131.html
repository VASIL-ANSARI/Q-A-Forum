<p>To preserve newlines, parse line by line before sending each line to the cmu parser.</p>

<p>For dealing with single-syllable words, you probably want to try both 0 and 1 for it when nltk returns 1 (looks like nltk already returns 0 for some words that would never get stressed, like "the"). So, you'll end up with multiple permutations:
1101111101
0101010101
1101010101</p>

<p>and so forth. Then you have to pick ones that look like a known forms.</p>

<p>For non-dictionary words, I'd also fudge it the same way: figure out the number of syllables (the dumbest way would be by counting the vowels), and permutate all possible stresses. Maybe add some more rules like "ea is a single syllable, trailing e is silent"...</p>

<p>I've never worked with other kinds of fuzzying, but you can check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/682367/good-python-modules-for-fuzzy-string-comparison">Good Python modules for fuzzy string comparison?</a> for some ideas.</p>
