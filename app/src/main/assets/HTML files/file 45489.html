<p>Maybe try adding <code>rpcallowip=127.0.0.1</code> into your config and see what happens.  </p>

<p>Also make sure that your <code>bitcoind.conf</code> is actually being used, to test this you can set the daemon to testnet using <code>testnet=1</code> in <code>bitcoind.conf</code>.  Restart your bitcoind server then do <code>bitcoin-cli getinfo</code> to see which network it's connected to.  If the change isn't reflected then perhaps the <code>bitcoind.conf</code> file is in another location?</p>

<p>Also, make sure you restart your bitcoind server every time you make a change to the <code>bitcoind.conf</code> file.</p>
