<p>Prepared statements do not accept placeholders for anything that is a MySQL identifier. This includes database, table and column names. You should simply concatenate a sanitised version of your table name to your statement and use <code>mysqli_query()</code>.</p>

<p>The reason is this: MySQL will parse a prepared statement and prepare a complete execution plan when you prepare it. This includes which tables it will use, which indexes, and how it will select from the columns. When you execute the statement it substitutes the variable data into the execution plan and creates a result.</p>

<p>If you try and prepare a statement including a MySQL entity like a table as an unknown, MySQl is unable to create the execution plan.</p>
