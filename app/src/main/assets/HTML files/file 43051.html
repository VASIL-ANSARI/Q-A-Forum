<p>The standard way to do it on bash/OSX from the JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/help/working-with-rubymine-features-from-command-line.html#d264576e249" rel="nofollow">site</a>:</p>

<p><code>$&lt;RubyMine&gt; &lt;path1&gt; --line&lt;number&gt; &lt;path2&gt;</code></p>

<p>That's the launcher, the path to the project, the line you want the file to open to and the path to the file in order. An example would be: <code>/Applications/RubyMine.app/Contents/MacOS/rubymine ~/RubyMineProjects/untitled45 --line 1 ~/RubyMineProjects/untitled45/sample.sass</code> These can be pretty long commands, but you can create a symlink to shorten the launcher at least.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that launching from the command line launches with the ruby version you have set there as well as any other command line configs. If you want to keep configurations from the editor you should open the project the conventional way.</p>
