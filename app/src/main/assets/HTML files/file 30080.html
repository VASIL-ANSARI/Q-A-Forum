<p>Your code should work. The problem you're having is that you need to set your working directory since I dunno where the default is.</p>

<pre><code>Product &gt; Edit Scheme &gt; Info &gt; Working Directory
</code></pre>

<p>There you can set it. Once you've set it and placed the .dat in the same folder it'll work.</p>
