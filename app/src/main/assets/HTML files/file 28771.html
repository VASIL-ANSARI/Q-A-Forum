<p>No. There is no single association between <code>Facility</code> and <code>People</code> that you can enumerate/count. You have set up two separate associations, albeit accessible only from one side. You have not provided any way to reference the associations from <code>People</code> as there are no corresponding HABTM references to <code>Facility</code> in <code>People</code>.</p>

<p>You can sum the size the two associations you've shown, or if you are concerned about overlap/duplication in the associations, enumerate/count the unique <code>User</code> references.</p>
