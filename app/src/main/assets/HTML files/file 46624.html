<p>In jQuery docs you can find the following: </p>

<p>'Cross-domain <code>json</code> requests are converted to <code>jsonp</code> unless the request includes <code>jsonp: false</code> in its request options.' </p>

<p>So probably you are making a cross domain call and it is converted to <code>jsonp</code> because you have specified <code>dataType: 'json'</code>. </p>

<p>When in JSONP mode, jQuery looks for such kind of response:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery18406445654265099913_1319844792316({
"developments": [
    {
        "name": "h2010 Ph2"
    },
    {
        "name": "The Meadows Ph2"
    },
    {
        "name": "h2010 Ph3"
    },
    {
        "name": "h2010 Ph4"
    },
    {
        "name": "The Meadows Ph3"
    }
  ]
}) 
</code></pre>

<p>but not a JSON string, so you are getting an error during the convertion.
JSONP expects a javascript, not a string.
If you take a look at the jQuery code you can make it more clear for you, but that's in general. </p>
