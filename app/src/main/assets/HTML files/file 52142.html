<p>@James,
Okay. I'm going to point you to three tutorials that show work for you. One caveat, this tutorials are only intended for <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Phonegap Build</em></a>, a cloud-based build service by Adobe/Phonegap. The tutorials are mobile-device friendly.</p>

<p>The first tutorial you may not need. It simple reinforces the <em>Phonegap Build</em> concept. The point is with <em>Phonegap Build</em> you are not using <em>CLI</em> or an <em>IDE</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codesnippets.altervista.org/blog/2015/BLOG.2015-06-10.jssnippets.html" rel="nofollow">An HTML Boilerplate for Phonegap</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Next is the demo app to do your splashscreen. It is included as a larger demo/example batch of "core" plugins available for Cordova/Phonegap.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codesnippets.altervista.org/blog/2015/BLOG.2015-05-12.codesnippets.html" rel="nofollow">Ten (10) Phonegap Demo Apps with Source Code</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last tutorial is the one you are looking for. This is an example of <em>how to open an external webpage within phonegap using the *whitelist* system</em>. <s>I have not had time to write a full tutorial for this, but I think you can "get it".</s> I forgot I did do the tutorial</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jssnippets.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/phonegap-build-external-webpage-in-iframe-with-whitelist-example/" rel="nofollow">Tutorial: Phonegap Build external webpage in iframe with whitelist example</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/jessemonroy650/tutorial-html5ui-hide-show" rel="nofollow">tutorial-html5ui-hide-show</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>One last note on the whitelist. It is required as of <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/news/2015/04/21/tools-release.html" rel="nofollow">Cordova Tools 5.0.0</a> (April 21, 2015). For <em>Phonegap Build</em>, that means since <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/06/16/phonegap-updated-on-build/" rel="nofollow"><code>cli-5.1.1</code></a> (16 Jun 2015)</p>

<p>Lastly, you started your post by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>basically I have delay the splash srceen for 12 mill seconds</em>. (sic) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>12 parts out of 1000 parts of a second cannot be detected. So, I'm not sure what you mean by this. </p>

<p>If you need further explanation on this, I can append to this post. -Best of Luck.</p>

<p>Almost for forgot the <a href="http://codesnippets.altervista.org/examples/html5/tutorial-html5-hide-show/" rel="nofollow">DEMO</a></p>
