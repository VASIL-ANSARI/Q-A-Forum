<p>As far as I can tell there isn't a clean, elegant way to do this.</p>

<p>What I have resorted to is this:</p>

<p>I created a utility method called wrapInFrame(View) that takes a view and wraps inside of a Frame layout and then returns the FrameLayout as a result (I stole the basic implementation from the support library source).  This method must be called from the onCreateView method in order to wrap your own custom view.</p>

<p>Once you have a FrameLayout at the root of your fragment's view hierarchy it becomes very easy to implement layering.</p>
