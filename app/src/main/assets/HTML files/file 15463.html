<p>What kind of formatting was lost? The original string <code>$html</code> has no formatting either :) if you <code>echo $html;</code> you will see that there is no formatting there either. If you want, you could add <code>\n</code> to the end of each line where you want a newline (make sure to replace the single quotes surrounding the strings with double quotes as well). So for example, your second line would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$html .= '&lt;li class="pagination-start"&gt;&lt;div class="img-start"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'.$list['start']['data']."&lt;/li&gt;\n";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> (after question was updated):</p>

<p>In this case, it's probably because the CSS for the new class name is not set. In your css file if you make new classes for <code>img-start-active</code> and <code>img-end-active</code> with the same contents as <code>img-start</code> and <code>img-end</code> you shouldn't lose any formatting.</p>
