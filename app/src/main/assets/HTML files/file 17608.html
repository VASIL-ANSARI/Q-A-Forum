<p>You will want to look at using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/services" rel="nofollow">Services</a> module. Sumit Kataria gave a good presentation on how one would go about <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/sessions/developing-apps-iphone-ipad-android-using-drupal-base-system" rel="nofollow">developing android/iphone apps using Drupal as a base</a> at DrupalCon Chicago 2011 (there is a video of the session). He covers more then what you are looking for, but does provides a good introduction on how to go about using services.</p>
