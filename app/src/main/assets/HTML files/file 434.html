<p>edit: I should clarify... my definition of best involves not just algorithm efficiency but code readability and maintainability as well. Using standard library functions means maintaining less code and reading much less too. Beyond that, you can get into year-long debates with PhD professors about the best "true random" function, so somebody will always disagree with you on randomization questions.</p>
