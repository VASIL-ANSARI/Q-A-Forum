<p>I feel as if the best manner of doing what I think you are trying to do is fork a process off, and create a process running within it? This is, if it's what you're asking best done with the unistd.h library, in both C and C++, and if you want to get a bit more direct the PThreads library. However if you don't at the moment know how these things are called, I recommend heavy reading before you mistakenly create a fork bomb, and crash your system.Look into the openpub documentation if needed. However I heavily recommend cleaning up this question, and I also feel that it's been asked a bit often on this site as well.</p>
