<p>From what I have read about show profile, 'sending data'  is a portion of execution process, and has almost nothing to do with sending actual data to the client. You can take a look on <a href="http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?24,241461,242012#msg-242012" rel="nofollow">this thread</a><br>
Also, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/general-thread-states.html" rel="nofollow">mysql docs</a> says about "Sending data" :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thread is reading and processing rows for a <code>SELECT</code> statement, and sending data to the client. Because operations occurring during this state tend to perform large amounts of disk access (reads), it is often the longest-running state over the lifetime of a given query.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In  my opinion, mysql would better not mix together "reading and processing rows for a SELECT statement" and "sending data" in one state, especially in state called "sending" data" which causes lots of confusion.</p>
