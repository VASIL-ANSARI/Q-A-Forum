<p>You will probably have some insufficient constraints after removing the button, so maybe you should compensate those. For example, you might want to add a constraint between <code>locationDescription</code> and <code>detailOfLocation</code> since their vertical position becomes ambiguous after removing the button. The scrollview scrolling is also related probably to the constraints.
