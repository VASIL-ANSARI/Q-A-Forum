  <p>Is there any way I can find out if a function will return a promise?</p>

<p>No (not without actually invoking it). Your best recourse here is to rely on consistency in naming and API conventions.</p>

<p>Just for a quick "proof" on the inability to test for a return type, consider the following function:</p>

<pre><code>function maybeAPromise() {
    if (Math.random() &lt; .5) {
        return Promise.resolve('foo');
    } else {
        return 'bar';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While I personally feel that the productivity advantages of dynamic languages like JavaScript are worth their tradeoffs, there's no denying that the lack of compile-time type safety is one of the tradeoffs in the "negative" category.</p>

<p>That being said, <code>Promise.resolve()</code> is handy if you simply want to force a result to be a <code>Promise</code>. E.g., </p>

<pre><code>Promise.resolve(maybeAPromise()).then(...);
</code></pre>
