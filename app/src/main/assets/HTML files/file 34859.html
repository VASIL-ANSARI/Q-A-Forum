<p>The line in <code>project.properties</code> that enables ProGuard with optimization typically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android-optimize.txt:proguard-project.txt
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course replace these two files by a single custom configuration file, but you then should be careful to specify the proper settings. If you specify <code>-dontshrink</code>, <code>-dontoptimize</code>, <code>-dontobfuscate</code>, or <code>-keep</code> with patterns that are too broad, you may not see the optimizations that you'd like.</p>

<p>With Ant and Eclipse, ProGuard is only applied for release builds.</p>

<p>With Gradle, you have to enable ProGuard in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>
