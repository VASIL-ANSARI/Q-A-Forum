<p>Where did you read that- if a record is in dm_exec_cached_plans then it should always have a corresponding record in dm_exec_query_stats ?<br>
Actually <code>dm_exec_cached_plans</code> has a record for every compiled plan in the plan cache, and <code>dm_exec_query_stats</code> can have a record for every query statement in the corresponding cached plan. <code>dm_exec_query_stats</code> can be empty for a cached plan of cache object types "Parse Tree" or "CLR Compiled Proc" or for objects such as system stored procedures, ad hoc queries, prepared statements.</p>
