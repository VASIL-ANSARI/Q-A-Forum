<p>I think it is clearly stated in the documentation: <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification" rel="nofollow">http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification</a></p>

<p>The option <code>cert</code> is to send you own certificate, e.g. authenticate yourself against the server using a client certificate. It needs a certificate file and if the key is not in the same file as the certificate also the key file. </p>

<p>The option <code>verify</code> is used to enable (default) or disable verification of the servers certificate. It can take True or False or a name of a file which contains the trusted CAs. If not given I think (not documented?) it will take the default CA path/file from OpenSSL, which works usually on UNIX (except maybe OS X) and not on windows.</p>
