<p>Normally, what I do in Eclipse is create a general project. After it is created, I do a right click on my project and press Configure -> Convert to maven project. I assume there will be an equivalent way of doing this in Spring.</p>

<p>Another alternative (again in eclipse, sorry if it is different in spring, but it should have an equivalent) is creating a simple maven project:</p>

<pre><code> New project -&gt; Maven project -&gt; 
 Check on "Create a simple project (skip archetype selection) -&gt; 
 Next -&gt; Enter your artifact group ID and artifact ID and click finish.     
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the trick even without selecting a parent application.</p>

<p>I prefer the first alternative, since everything is already filled in for me, but both of them do the same thing.</p>
