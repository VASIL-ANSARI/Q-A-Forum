<p>You can use an <code>html5</code> canvas:</p>

<p>An alternative without html5 is using a masking image (an image with a transparent part in the middle, with the shape you like, and the rest with the background color). Then you just have to overlap the 2 images and put the first on top. The image could be also an svg.</p>
