<p>In your specific case where you want to inject the dependancy to all controllers I would have a BaseController which will have a property of type IScreenRepository</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseController
{
  private IScreenRepository _screen = NullScreenRepository.Instance;
  public IScreenRepository Screen {get { return _screen; } set { _screen = value; } } 

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can set you IOC to inject the property dependency for all your controllers. It's also good to have a NullScreenRepository to make sure if you dependency is not injected it won't break code that instantiates controller directly and not from the IOC container (like unit tests). </p>

<p>This way you will be able to use it in all controllers without worrying where it came from. And you can mock it and fully test your controllers.</p>
