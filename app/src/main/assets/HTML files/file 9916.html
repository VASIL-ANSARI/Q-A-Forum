<p>This is from <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html</a>:</p>

<p>"There can only be a single busy handler for a particular database connection any(at) any given moment. If another busy handler was defined (using sqlite3_busy_handler()) prior to calling this routine, that other busy handler is cleared. "</p>

<p>So if you're executing data calls in a multiple threads the above requirement of a 'single busy handler' would be violated. </p>

<p>I would recommend putting it in the app delegate.</p>

<p>hope this helps.</p>
