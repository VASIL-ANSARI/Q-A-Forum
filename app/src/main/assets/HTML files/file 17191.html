  <p>I have tried using facebook api to post the ratings on the friends all.</p>

<p>Do all of the userâs friends actually <em>want</em> to have this posted to their wall?</p>

<p>This behavior could easily lead to some of them flagging your posts as spam â¦ (Just a warning, itâs up to you what your app does.)</p>

  <p>but it is taking a long time to respond</p>

<p>Thatâs because youâre making one API call and therefor also one HTTP request for each friend in your loop.</p>

<p>Try bundling the API calls into one (or more) <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/batch/" rel="nofollow">batch requests</a> to speed things up â this limits the amount of actual HTTP requests happening, and therefore should be noticeably quicker.</p>
