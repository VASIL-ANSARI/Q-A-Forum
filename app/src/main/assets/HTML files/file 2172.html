<p>You need to pass an <em>instance</em> of the type into <code>GetValue</code>. If it is a static property, pass <code>null</code>. Currently you are passing the <em>type</em>. I would expect to see (roughly):</p>

<pre><code>Type targetType = obj.GetType();
...[snip]
fieldOrder = (string[])fieldOrderColumn.GetValue(obj, null);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you aren't sure of the type of array, you can just use <code>Array</code> (instead of <code>string[]</code>), or for single-dimension arrays <code>IList</code> may be useful (and will handle arrays, lists etc):</p>

<pre><code>IList list = (IList)fieldOrderColumn.GetValue(obj, null);
</code></pre>
