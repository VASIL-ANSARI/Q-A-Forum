<p>There is another very challenging requirement to test for prime, it must not divide by any other numbers. For example 4 is greater than zero and 4 % 4 = 0. But 4 is not a prime, it is equal to 2x2.</p>

<p>Testing for prime is rather difficult. Most starting programming books want you to experiment with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, which is an old way to determine if a number is a prime. The wiki page proposes an algorithm to implement for this. Basically you generate numbers from 1 to 100 in an array and remove those who are not prime, leaving you all primes from 1 to 100.</p>
