<p>You have to set your viewcontroller as scrollviews delegate. Assuming you have UIImageView that you are zooming in scrollView. What you want to do is to center it in the middle of scrollviews bounds while zooming. If you only want to disable scrolling in vertical or horizontal direction then change only x or y center of imageView</p>

<pre><code>- (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
 {
  self.imageView.center=CGPointMake(CGRectGetMidX(self.scrollView.bounds), CGRectGetMidY(self.scrollView.bounds));
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I highly recommend having a look at apple video session on advanced scrollview techniques 2010, 2011 and 2012 they really explain quite well what a powerful beast UIScrollView really is. Hope this was helpful</p>
