<p><code>Klass</code> isn't a type, so it doesn't make sense to talk of <code>Klass</code>'s methods. <code>Kalss&lt;int&gt;</code> is a type with it's own methods, and so is <code>Klass&lt;double&gt;</code>. In your example there would be one set of methods for each type.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> in real life, it isn't as simple as that. The question of the actual existence of the methods also depends on other factors, see @KerrekSB's answer to this question.</p>
