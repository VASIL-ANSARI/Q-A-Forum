<p>There's a larger application design problem with your example.</p>

<p>You should avoid all use of jQuery inside your Angular project. By working directly on the DOM, jQuery upsets how Angular is designed to operate.</p>

<p>If you want to add classes and things to HTML elements, you can use a combination of the ordinary class attribute and ngClass. Here's some doco on ngClass: <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass</a></p>

<p>Showing and hiding elements should be done with either ngShow or ngIf:

<a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngIf" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngIf</a></p>

<p>They should work off scope variables that you have defined in your controllers.</p>
