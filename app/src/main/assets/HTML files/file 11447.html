<p>Most likely your settings activity has it's launch mode set to <code>singleTask</code> in your manifest. This leads to a immediate cancel response when calling <code>startActivityForResult()</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that this method should only be used with Intent protocols that
  are defined to return a result. In other protocols (such as
  ACTION_MAIN or ACTION_VIEW), you may not get the result when you
  expect. For example, if the activity you are <strong>launching uses the
  singleTask launch mode, it will not run in your task and thus you will
  immediately receive a cancel result.</strong></p>
