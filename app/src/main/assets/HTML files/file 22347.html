<p>In your current scenario, the first thing to check for is whether your makefiles are creating executables rather than simply object files.  It seems like the latter if you're saying that the output from each makefile can be run on it's own.  If the output is indeed an executable rather than an object file, you're not going to be able to "link" those executables together into a new executable.  So what you want to make sure is that the output of the compilation process for each <code>.cpp</code> file is an object file with a <code>.o</code> extension, and that only a <em>single</em> <code>.cpp</code> file has a <code>main()</code> function.  The process of creating object files rather than executables can be done using the <code>-c</code> option with <code>g++</code>.  </p>

<p>Once you have object and/or library files created from each of the <code>.cpp</code> files, and a single <code>.cpp</code> file with a <code>main()</code> entry-point function, you can then link the object/library files together to create a final executable using <code>g++</code> that will then include the functionality described in each of the individual <code>.cpp</code> files.</p>
