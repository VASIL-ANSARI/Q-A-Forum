<p>I think your classpath is wrong. Try</p>

<pre><code>set CLASSPATH=C:\Users\robe\Documents\hibernate\project1\src\main\java
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need the org. That is part of the full qualified class name. The full class name is org.hibernate.tutorial.EventManager</p>

<p>I am not familiar with this tutorial's problem. You may get other classpath errors. If you do you can add more to the class path by separating them by a semi colon.</p>

<p>Also you are setting the classpath in the cmd line. It will only be set for that session so you will have to run your mavem command in the same one. Or set it in your global environment variables</p>
