<p>Generally speaking dask.array does not guarantee out-of-core operation on all computations.  A square matrix-matrix multiply (or any L3 BLAS operation) is more-or-less impossible to do efficiently in small memory.  </p>

<p>You <em>can</em> ask Dask to use an on-disk cache for intermediate values.  See the <a href="http://dask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a> under the question <strong>My computation fills memory, how do I spill to disk?</strong>.  However this will be limited by disk-writing speeds, which are generally fairly slow.</p>

<p>A large memory machine and NumPy is probably the simplest way to resolve this problem.  Alternatively you could try to find a different formulation of your problem.</p>
