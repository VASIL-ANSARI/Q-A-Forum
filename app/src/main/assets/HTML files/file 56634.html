<p>The problem arose from not understanding <code>CMTimeRangeMake</code> and <code>insertTimeRange</code>. </p>

<p>The second value of <code>CMTimeRangeMake</code> should be the clip duration, not the end time. So if your start time is the 5 second mark, and the clip lasts 10 seconds, the second value should be 10, not 15.</p>

<p>The <code>atTime</code> parameter of <code>insertTimeRange</code> should be <code>kCMTimeZero</code> since the goal is to create a new clip. In other words, this value says where in <em>the new track</em> to insert the clip from the source track.</p>
