<p>I am not sure what you want to achieve.<br>
But if you want to have a swipe delete for a section header, the answer is, you can do it, but it requires some kind of programming. Essentially, you had to add a âsection header delete buttonâ as a subview to the table views content view.<br>
I suggest reading Ray Wenderlichs tutorial â<a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/62435/make-swipeable-table-view-cell-actions-without-going-nuts-scroll-views" rel="nofollow">How To Make A Swipeable Table View Cell With Actions â Without Going Nuts With Scroll Views</a>â. This demonstrates how you can add swipe gestures to a table view cell.<br>
However the same techniques (e.g. controlling the position within the scroll view) can be applied to a section views header.</p>
