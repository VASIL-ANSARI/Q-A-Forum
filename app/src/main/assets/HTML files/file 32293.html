<p>You're already converting it to a <code>datetime</code> object, which is 100% correct.</p>

<p>We need to compare that against two other <code>datetime</code> objects, representing the start and end of our date range. Create the start timestamp by passing year, month, day into the datetime class:</p>

<pre><code>start_timestamp = datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 14)
</code></pre>

<p>Now create the end timestamp by adding a <code>timedelta</code> object equal to one week, (7 days)</p>

<pre><code>end_timestamp = start_timestamp + datetime.timedelta(7)
</code></pre>

<p>Last, ensure the tweet timestamp is between start and end:</p>

<pre><code>if start_timestamp &lt; start_created_at &lt; end_timestamp:
    print 'yay!'
</code></pre>
