<p>Probably a relatively simple way is to create an ActionFilter and apply it to ControllerBase. Let's say you made it DebugModeAttribute.</p>

<pre><code>public class DebugModeAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        if (filterContext.RequestContext.HttpContext.Request.Form["hidden_var"] == "true")
        {
            var controller = filterContext.Controller as ControllerBase;
            if (controller != null)
                controller.Debug = true;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It should get the job done, although it might not be the cleanest looking solution. Regardless of the solution though, you'll have to be careful if your DI container isn't creating new instances for each request. Might be safer to modify the HttpContext.Items and add a getter on the base that will read out the value stored there.</p>
