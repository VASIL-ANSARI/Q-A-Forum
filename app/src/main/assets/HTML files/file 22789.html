<p>This is due to the fact that as of version pre4 you cannot set a property or observable upon the <code>Em.*.create()</code> function. You have to first use the <code>.extend()</code> function first and set all your properties and observables in that, then create that object.</p>

<p>As an example, take a look at this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Deif/nv7y5/15/">jsfiddle</a> that is working with the extend functionality. Then try to take it away by using only <code>create</code> and you'll see that the app no longer works.</p>
