<p>What you are proposing is a one-to-many relationship.  There is a ton of information about db relationships on the internet.  Each Post could have Many people that would be allowed to use it.  So you would have a posts table and a users table and a users_post table.  The users post table would contain a post_id and a user_id. You would then have to check if the user could view the post through this relationship.</p>

<p>You could also put the users in groups, which would simplify this.</p>

<p>You should never store multiple values in an array in one column of the db.</p>
