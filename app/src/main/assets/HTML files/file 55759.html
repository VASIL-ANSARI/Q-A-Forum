  <p>But is there a way to 'see' the file created with the File Manager on android?</p>

<p>I am not certain what "the File Manager" is that you are referring to, as Android does not really have one. However, you are writing to an app's <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/07/storage-situation-internal-storage.html" rel="nofollow">internal storage</a>, and that is private to the app. It cannot be viewed by other apps or ordinary users, except on rooted devices and via some cumbersome Android SDK tools.</p>

  <p>So how to do this right? </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>File file = new File(this.getExternalFilesDir(null), "testfile.txt");
FileOutputStream fileOutput = new FileOutputStream(file);
OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter=new OutputStreamWriter(fileOutput);
outputStreamWriter.write("lalala");
outputStreamWriter.flush();
fileOutput.getFD().sync();
outputStreamWriter.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Please do this work on a background thread</p></li>
<li><p>On Android 4.3 (API Level 18) and older devices, you need to hold the <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission to work with <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/08/storage-situation-external-storage.html" rel="nofollow">external storage</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you also want to have this file show up quickly in on-device or on-development-machine file managers, use this after closing the file:</p>

<pre><code>MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(
  this,
  new String[]{file.getAbsolutePath()},
  null,
  null);
</code></pre>

<p>(where <code>this</code> is some <code>Context</code>, such as an <code>Activity</code> or <code>Service</code>)</p>
