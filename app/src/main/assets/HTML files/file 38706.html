<p>So, I found an answer and it was stupidly simple. I swear I tried this already and it didn't work, but everything is working fine now. All I had to do was move the AudioRecord object outside of the engine class and into the service class. I then create the AudioRecord object in onCreateEngine only if it isn't already instantiated. That way, all engine instances use the same AudioRecord object.</p>
