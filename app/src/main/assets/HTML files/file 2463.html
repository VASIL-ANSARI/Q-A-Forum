<p><strike>You need a concrete JAX-WS implementation. Tomcat isn't, it's just a Servlet API implementation. You'll need another appserver which implements JAX-WS as well (e.g. Glassfish), or to add a concrete JAX-WS implementation to your webapp. Glassfish uses <a href="https://metro.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Metro</a>, which is built on top of <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Sun reference JAX-WS implementation</a>. You can download it separately and use on Tomcat as well.

<p><strong>Update</strong> you need <code>javax.ws.rs</code> package, <strong>not</strong> <code>javax.ws</code> package only ;) So here's a slight modified answer:</p>
