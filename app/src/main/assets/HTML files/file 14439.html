<p>This is because the second cloned table doesn't exist when you bind the clone row click event. You need to use the jQuery .on() function to do this.</p>

<p>Basically, when you use .click() it binds that function to all the elements it can find matching the selector, which at document ready, is only one table. .on() works on all elements going forward in time, not just those that exist at the time the script is run.</p>

<p>If you really want to use .click() instead of .on(), re-bind the clicks after you've made the second table.</p>
