<p>I guess one set of rules is needed for each extension. You may try this in one .htaccess file at root directory:</p>

<pre><code>Options +FollowSymlinks -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

## Option using html extension
# Check if it is to a file without query
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html\s [NC]
# Remove the extension and show the name at the browser's address bar
RewriteRule  .*  /%1  [R=301,L,NC]

# Prevent loops
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html  [NC]
# Map silently to the original file
RewriteRule  ^([^/]+)/?  /$1.html  [L,NC]
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat the last 4 lines modifying all instances of the extension accordingly.</p>
