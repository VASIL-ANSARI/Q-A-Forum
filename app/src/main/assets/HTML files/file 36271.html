<p>It's still a little unclear what the specific problem is.</p>

<p>However, note that in a <code>RelativeLayout</code>, the children are laid out in top left corner by default, overlapping each other unless told otherwise.</p>

<p>To make the <code>RelativeLayout</code> children lay out relative to each other, add some layout rules. For example, to get similar results as in a vertical <code>LinearLayout</code>, use</p>

<pre><code>android:layout_below="@id/id_of_previous_child_view"
</code></pre>

<p>attribute in <code>RelativeLayout</code> child views.</p>
