<p>CherryPy's WSGI server is about as fast as a pure-Python WSGI server is going to get.  I personally use it behind Nginx in production, but even standalone on my dev machine I can load each instance with several hundred requests / sec. without problems.</p>

<p>Can you find a faster server? Yes. Is CherryPy a robust web server, and good enough for most people to use in production? Yes.</p>
