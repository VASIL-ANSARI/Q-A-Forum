<p>First, you usually don't need to use methods in GC class, except probably for SuppressFinalize. Most of the other methods will usually makes you application performs worst, not better.</p>

<p>But, to answer your questions, as far as i know when collection performed there is internal list held by the garbage collector of finalizers to run, <strong>and they all run sequencally on the same thread</strong>. Which means, that if one finalizer block then i guess this method will block too.</p>

<p>When app domain shuts down, there is a time limit for all finalizers to finish, and in that case i guess it doesn't really matter.</p>
