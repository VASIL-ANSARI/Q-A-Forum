<p>you can try to use a negative lookahead <code>(?!..)</code> before the last 4 characters:</p>

<pre><code>var regexPDF = new RegExp('href=[\'"](assets/(?:.*?(?!\.pdf).{4}|.{0,3}))?[\'"]','gi');
</code></pre>

<p>Notice: you don't need to use <code>|</code> in a character class, since it is seen as literal</p>
