<p>I haven't tested it buy, you might want to trying the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to your Asset Publishers Configuration page</li>
<li>Under the "Filter" section set it to "Contains", "All", "Tags"</li>
<li>Leave "Include tags specified in the URL?" ticked</li>
</ol>

<p>It should then apply these rules to all tags, not just manually entered ones in the Configuration.</p>

<p>Let us know if it works.</p>
