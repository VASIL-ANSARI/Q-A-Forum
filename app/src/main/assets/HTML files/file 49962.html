<p>If you can't make any assumptions about the ordering of the array, then I think the best you can do is O(n):</p>

<pre><code>def largest_less_than(numlist, n):
    answer = min(numlist, key=lambda x: n-x if n&gt;=x else float('inf'))
    if answer &gt; n:
        answer = None
    return answer
</code></pre>

<p>If the question is about repeatedly getting the largest-less-than for different <code>n</code> values on the same dataset, then maybe one solution is using <a href="http://www.geekviewpoint.com/python/sorting/bucketsort" rel="nofollow">bucket sort</a> to get your list sorted in O(n), and then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow"><code>bisect</code></a> repeatedly.</p>
