<p>If you are talking about downloading the files in a logging bucket, we use something like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>connect to S3 (using the access/secret keys)</li>
<li>open up the bucket entitled <code>"loggingBucket"</code></li>
<li>get each of the objects in that bucket</li>
<li>read the file in and process it</li>
<li>after we process each file, we remove it</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the sample code:</p>

<pre><code>BasicAWSCredentials credentials =
    new BasicAWSCredentials("accessKey", "secretAccessKey");
AmazonS3Client client = new AmazonS3Client(credentials);

for (ObjectListing listing = client.listObjects("loggingBucket");;
        listing = client.listNextBatchOfObjects(listing)) {
    // run through each listing to process it
    for (S3ObjectSummary summary : listing.getObjectSummaries()) {
        String bucketName = summary.getBucketName();
        String fileName = summary.getKey();
        S3Object object = client.getObject(bucketName, fileName);
        S3ObjectInputStream stream = object.getObjectContent();
        BufferedReader reader =
            new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));
        ... process the file here writing it locally or something
        // delete the file afterwards
        client.deleteObject(bucketName, fileName);
    }
    // we may need to get more files
    if (!listing.isTruncated()) {
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>
