<p>According to the exception code in your crash log, you "8 bad food". Your app is taking too long to initialize so it is getting killed by iOS. You'll need to move your app startup processing to background threads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exception code 0x8badf00d indicates that an application has been
  terminated by iOS because a watchdog timeout occurred. The application
  took too long to launch, terminate, or respond to system events. One
  common cause of this is doing synchronous networking on the main
  thread. Whatever operation is on Thread 0: needs to be moved to a
  background thread, or processed differently, so that it does not block
  the main thread.</p>
