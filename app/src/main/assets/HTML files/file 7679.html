<p>Java Web Start does assume a GUI app and does its best to hide the code it downloads from the users.  It doesn't seem right for a command line app that users are apt to, for example, incorporate in their own scripts.</p>

<p>Maybe you could write a simple GUI that retrieves the latest version of your command-line JAR and puts it where your users are expecting it, and put that GUI in JWS.</p>
