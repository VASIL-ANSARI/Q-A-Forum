<p>You could create a UIBarButtonItem with a custom view that has both an image and label.  You can ask the system for the UIBarButtonItemStlyePlain style properties using UIAppearance protocols.  </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>UIColor *textColor = [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] titleTextAttributesForState:UIControlStateNormal][UITextAttributeTextColor];</code></p>
