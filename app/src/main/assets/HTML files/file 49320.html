<p>It is not normal practice. I mean, it would be inevitable that coffeescript gets installed since it is a dependency but the user of the module should not worry about it.</p>

<p>I just took a quick look at the source code of the <code>assert-type</code> and this is what I found:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the project is 3 years old. That's a lot!</p></li>
<li><p>the <code>package.json</code> is listing <code>coffeescript</code> as a dependency BUT it is using <code>latest</code> instead of locking a version of coffeescript which is a terrible practice.</p></li>
<li><p>My guess is that what it changed was <code>coffeescript</code> module, that instead of needing <code>require('coffeescript')</code> you now need <code>require('coffeescript/register')</code>. (Take a look at the <code>index.js</code> in the repo)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Based on that I'd say it is fine that you write that line. A better option would be to make the changes in the <code>node-assert-type</code> repo and submit a PR with the fixes for #2 and #3.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
