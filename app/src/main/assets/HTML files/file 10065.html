<p>Have you tried creating a new <code>tvbuff_t</code> as <code>TVBUFF_REAL_DATA</code> and providing your memory region as the <code>data</code> parameter?</p>

<pre><code>tvbuff_t *tvb = tvb_new_real_data(mem_buffer_ptr, mem_buf_length, mem_buf_length);
//mem_buffer_ptr is your memory buffer
//mem_buf_length is the number of bytes in your buffer
</code></pre>

<p>Wireshark historically does not play well with other applications, so whether this will work or not is questionable, especially if you think your data may change while it is being dissected. Is it not possible to write out a temporary file?</p>
