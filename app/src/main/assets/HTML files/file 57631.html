<p>This should work:</p>

<pre><code>sentence = "WHAT IS MINE IS YOURS AND WHAT IS YOURS IS MINE";    
sentence = sentence.lower();
sentence = sentence.split();

uniqueWord = [];

for i in sentence:
    if i not in uniqueWord:
        uniqueWord.append(i);

for word in sentence:
    print uniqueWord.index(word) + 1
</code></pre>
