<p>There are many ways to solve this problem. Since you are already using variable traces, perhaps the simplest solution is to pass the index of the canvas item to the callback.  You can use <code>lambda</code> or <code>functools.partial</code> for this task. You could also not use variable traces, but instead, associate a command with each radiobutton. In both cases you simply need to tell the callback which index to operate on.</p>

<p>In the following example, the callback takes a reference to a variable and the index to the canvas item. It fetches the value, looks up the color in a table, and then configures the canvas item:</p>

<pre><code>def on_radiobutton(var, index):
    value = var.get()
    color = {"in": "green", "out": "red", "unassigned": "yellow"}
    self.canvas.itemconfigure(index, fill=color[value])
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the trace is set up using lambda (note that <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code> and <code>op</code> are automatically sent by tkinter for every trace):</p>

<pre><code>var = tk.StringVar()
rb0 = tk.Radiobutton(..., variable=var, value="in", text="in")
rb1 = tk.Radiobutton(..., variable=var, value="out", text="out")
rb2 = tk.Radiobutton(..., variable=var, value="unassigned", text="not assigned")

var.trace("w", lambda name1, name2, op, index=i, var=var:
          on_radiobutton(var, index))
</code></pre>
