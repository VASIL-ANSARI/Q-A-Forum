<blockquote>
  <p>please tell me how much it is possible to make this on iOS?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>iOS is a mature OS that comes with Cocoa Touch, a huge library of classes. So, yes it is possible. And the question of possibility shouldn't be attached with the word <code>much</code>. Either something is possible, or something is impossible. Don't take it as how much. If it is possible, you can do it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how about background network connections and SQLite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this is possible. Like android, there is a rule in iOS that only your main thread can interact with the UI, and all other heavy tasks should be attached with other threads. You will use <code>Blocks</code> to accomplish this kind of functionality. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also is it possible to send local push notifications in background?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is quite possible. Have a look at the following document. </p>

<p>Do have a look at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/</a>, here you find a lot of documents related to the tasks you have asked in your question. </p>
