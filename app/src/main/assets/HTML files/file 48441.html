<p>I used <code>microtime(true) - LARAVEL_START</code>. Seems to give a fairly accurate response time.</p>

<p>As Bogdan mentions in the comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>LARAVEL_START</code> constant is defined in <code>bootstrap/autoload.php</code> which
  is the very first file included from <code>public/index.php</code>, so this makes
  it the first statement to be executed. If you place the middleware
  last on the list, its terminate method will be the last one executed
  before <code>app-&gt;terminate()</code> will be called, so you should get a pretty
  good computation of execution time.</p>
