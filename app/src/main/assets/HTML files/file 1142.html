<p>You should use JQuery to set the value of the textbox after the datepicker has been attached to the textbox.   </p>

<pre><code>$('txtBox').datepicker();
$('txtBox').val('2009');
or
document.getElementById('txtBox').value = '2009';
</code></pre>

<p>As long as you do it after the datepicker code has been attached, your preset value shouldn't get overwritten.</p>
