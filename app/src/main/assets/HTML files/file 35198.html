<p>If you don't want to go through the trouble that is Java reflection, you can write a simple static factory method that takes a String and returns the appropriate object.</p>

<pre><code>public static Blender createBlender(String type){
    switch(type){
    case "Cuisinart": return new Cuisinart();
    case "Oster": return new Oster();
    //etc
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you just pass in your command line argument into it and you'll have whatever Blender you need.</p>

<p>The only possible design issue is that you would have to type out a line for every class that implements Blender, so you'd have to update the method if you added more types later.</p>
