<p>How are you storing your dates in SQL Server ? is it a <code>datetime</code> column type. If it is, then the formatting is being applied in the way it's being displayed to you (due to locale settings).</p>

<p><code>121</code> formatter option will return it as a string in the format you want.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT convert(nvarchar, getdate(), 121)
--returns 2013-09-24 15:51:14.363
</code></pre>

<p>If on the otherhand it's being stored as a string, then you're going to need to do a little bit of string manipulation on it.</p>
