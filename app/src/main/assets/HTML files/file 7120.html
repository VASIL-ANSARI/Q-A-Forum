<p>The main reason of haml and most other nested stuff is that it is basically easy to look how your HTML is nested. I am assuming this but do you actually code HTML or do you do more backend stuff? The reason for it is that in nested style, you will see how your elements are nested(which is important to you if you are also writing the styles)</p>

<p>While it is quite easier to write </p>

<pre><code> .dom(:body).dom(:html)
</code></pre>

<p>it is difficult for a designer to see how the HTML flows without mapping and trying it to visualize in his head, whereas:</p>

<pre><code> %html
   %body
</code></pre>

<p>does that already with just one look. </p>

<p>Take not of a longer example:</p>

<pre><code> "This is a link to SO".dom(:a, href: "http://stackoverflow.com").dom(:body).dom(:html)
</code></pre>

<p>Would it be easier for you if say the client or you needed to add a clickable image to the link? How would you have done it? In haml it is easy as:</p>

<pre><code> %html
   %body
     %a{:href =&gt; "blah"}
       = image_tag("image.png")
</code></pre>

<p>Also, IMHO, writing <code>dom(:)</code> for each html tag is just as tedious as writing the closing tag for it(which HAML and the others fixed)</p>

<p>Again, these are just my opinions from an XHTML/CSS programmer(as opposed to a ruby programmer perspective)</p>

<p>And lastly, I would also think that this can be turned into a community wiki or something as this doesn't merit an exact answer and will probably spawn a lot of subjective ones like this one.</p>
