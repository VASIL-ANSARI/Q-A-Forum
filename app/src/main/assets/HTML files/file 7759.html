<p>I don't have all the answers for showing your own popup (that'll require some JS hacking), but to get rid of that magnifying glass, just add this to your CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body {
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>...Or just add to the element you want to disable the magnifier on.</p>
