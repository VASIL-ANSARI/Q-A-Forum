<p>If you look up the method <code>swipeTo()</code> in the library you'll find the following condition:</p>

<pre><code>if (index &gt; (_this.slides.length - 1) || index &lt; 0) return;
</code></pre>

<p><s>Which indicates you can only use this method from index 1.</s></p>

<p>Why don't you just initialize the plugin without the <code>pageBeforeShow</code> option? It should take the first slide.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Finally got it to work and I also hope the author reads this since this is a terrible library to setup as the configuration parameters go berzerk throughout the whole script.</p>

<pre><code>$(page2).click(function () {
    //mySwiper.activeIndex = 0;
    //mySwiper.startAutoplay();
    //mySwiper.swipeReset();
    //mySwiper.reInit(true);
    setTimeout(function(){
        // to make sure the swiper-wrapper is shown after the animation of $.mobile.changePage()
        mySwiper.swipeTo(0);
    }, 200);

    $.mobile.changePage(page2);
    // $("#photo").hide().delay(1000).fadeOut();
    // $("#photo").animate({opacity: 0.0}, 1);
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the commented functionality seems straightforward but only brings frustration to the people using this. For me this is a design flaw in naming convention and boolean traps.</p>

<p>I also noticed you set <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> dynamically and I'm sure there "is a way" to let the script calculate these parameters as it uses a polyfill for <code>getComputedStyle()</code>. Or you might try to use CSS3 <code>calc()</code> to take some performance hit out of JS.</p>

<p>Second time I use this library and again I had to use the unminified version to debug the functions and it's parameter setup which doesn't work together very well. Only a set of combinations can make this library work and it's up to the developer to figure this whole bunch out.</p>

<p>Good luck on the script and note that the provided code really helped (very quickly) in understanding the problem.</p>
