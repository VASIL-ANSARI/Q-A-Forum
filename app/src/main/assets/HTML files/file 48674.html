<p>Sure it works without data connection. </p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview" rel="nofollow">Google Play services</a> is basically the background app that is running in the Android OS. Thus by requesting connection to <code>GoogleApiClient</code> you are connecting to this Google Play services app.</p>

<p>It is said that Google Play services apk does silent updates, however it is better to check if it is updated to the latest version, since sometimes services fail to update (happened with me only on Android 2.3).</p>
