<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it not prefixed by a <code>template &lt;class...&gt;</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it's inside the definition of the <code>vector</code> class template. Inside the class template, you don't specify that each member is also a template. Adding a <code>template</code> specification to a member would give it extra template parameters, in addition to the class parameters, which aren't needed for this constructor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what does the first and only argument mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's an optional argument, which can be used to supply a custom memory allocator to give you more control over how the vector uses memory. Normally, you'd miss that argument out and get the default value. The default is an instance of <code>vector&lt;T&gt;::allocator_type</code>, which is an alias for <code>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</code>. This will allocate memory from the free store, using the global <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> operators.</p>
