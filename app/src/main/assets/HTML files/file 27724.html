<p>Regardless of the reasons <em>why</em> (which you don't state) to get the currently active, and expiring, session just capture it in the <code>Session_End</code> event e.g.</p>

<pre><code>void Session_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var oldSessionId = Session.SessionId;        
}
</code></pre>
