<p>I had this issue too, but only on iOS Devices, Android worked fine.
For me, turning off CSS-Transitions did it.</p>

<p>While initializing your flexslider set you can set use of CSS-transitions to false like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    $('.flexslider').flexslider({
        useCSS: false
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
