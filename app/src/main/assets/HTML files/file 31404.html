<p>Just to recap the correct comments above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-[__NSDictionaryI setObject:forKeyedSubscript:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NSDictionary does not implement any of the set... methods because it is immutable.  You state that you're creating with literals syntax when the data is not found on disk.  The literal syntax creates immutable containers</p>

<p>Instead, try...</p>

<pre><code>// try to initialize from disk, but if not
// we can still use literal (immutable) syntax, but in a mutable container
self.practiceRecords = [NSMutableDictionary
                           dictionaryWithDictionary:@{ @"key" : @"value" }];
</code></pre>
