<p>Synchronization depends on sharing a common lock. The <code>synchronized</code> keyword on an instance method means that for a thread to enter that method it first has to acquire the lock on <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>In your first example there is no shared lock, each of the two threads is locking on itself. Each thread acquires its own lock and nobody blocks, the two threads run concurrently. (The only locking going on here is that when a thread wants to write to the console it has to acquire the console's lock first, so that each println takes place atomically.)</p>

<p>In the second example the same Runnable is passed into each thread, so they both lock on the same object, the Runnable. One thread acquires the lock and executes, the other has to wait for the first thread to release the lock.</p>

<p>If you change the second example to give each thread a separate Runnable:</p>

<pre><code>Thread t=new Thread(new NewThreadt());    
Thread q=new Thread(new NewThreadt());
t.start();
q.start(); 
</code></pre>

<p>then you'll see synchronization doesn't work and it behaves like the first example.</p>
