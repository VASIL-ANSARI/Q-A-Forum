<p>A lot of times I will see individuals break the file out into sections, with a heading comment between sections.</p>

<p>Something like</p>

<pre><code>/* Headings and General Text */

.... stuff here for H1, etc..

/* Main page layout */

.... stuff here for layout page setup etc.
</code></pre>

<p>It works pretty well and can make it easy to go back later and find what you are working on.</p>
