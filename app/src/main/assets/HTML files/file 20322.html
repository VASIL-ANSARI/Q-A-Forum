<p>Without looking at your code, I would simply have my MouseListener's behavior depend on its state. I would give it a state boolean variable, say called enabled, complete with getters and setters, and then short-circuit the code if enabled is false. i.e., the specific methods could look something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void mousePressed(MouseEvent mEvt) {
  if (!enabled) {
    return;
  }
  // rest of mousePressed goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another suggestion, don't do this:</p>

<pre><code>public class P2 extends JPanel implements MouseListener {
</code></pre>

<p>Don't have your GUI classes implement your listener interfaces as you are asking the class to do too much. This is OK for toy programs or very small demo programs, but for larger projects, you will want to separate out your logic from your view from your control.</p>
