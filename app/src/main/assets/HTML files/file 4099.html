<p>It looks like every time you're configuring a cell, you re-download the entire image from the web (or reading from the hard disk, if that's where your URL points to):</p>

<pre><code>NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];
UIImage *img = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:data];
</code></pre>

<p>This is really slow! The way <code>UITableView</code> works is by reusing cells - every time a cell goes off-screen, it may be given back to the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> method to be used as the next cell that becomes visible.</p>

<p>This means that <em>every</em> time a new cell becomes visible, you're downloading and creating its image.</p>

<p>Instead, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and store all the images first (if there are only 12, it probably won't take too much memory).</p></li>
<li><p>Download the images as-needed, and if you get a memory warning, dump some of the cached images. This is a bit harder to implement, so I'd try the first solution first.</p></li>
</ol>
