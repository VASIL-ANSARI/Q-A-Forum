<p>You are using the same ID for all your elements (Posts and New Comment Buttons) so when you click <strong>New Comment</strong> button all of the partials got render on the first post. Because it is the first matching element found.
You should use different element IDs for your posts so when clicking on New Comment you will know where (which post i mean)to render the form.
for example you may use a counter like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= link_to 'New Comment', new_comment_path, id: 'new_comment_' + i++, remote: true %&gt;
</code>
then all you have to do is to pass the elements id and change the following line:
<code>$('#'+PassedElementId).hide().after('&lt;%= j render("form") %&gt;')</code></p>
