  <p>I havent found any docs, but u can make use of the <strong>built-in picasa app</strong> (if u
  r workin in 1.5) to upload ur photos to picasa web albums, but one
  limitation is that u dont hv the control of signing in and signing out... it
  uses the google account registered with the phone curently... if ur
  interested i can give u sm sample codes...</p>
