<p>If you are getting messy with writing your logs you should look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">AOP</a>. If you are already using spring you should read about <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/reference/aop.html">Spring AOP</a>, and for logging per se, read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2071050/is-using-spring-aop-for-logging-a-good-idea">using Spring AOP for logging</a> </p>
