<p>Well cronjobs are in fact not the thing you need.</p>

<p>With cronjobs you can schedule a task. What you want is client side refresh when new info is found. While cronjobs are server side and always on an interval.</p>

<p>What you need is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3583203/server-polling-with-javascript">polling</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow">commet</a></p>

<p>The first, polling, you use your client side to execute a script every x seconds and look if there is new info (waste of resources in my opinion).</p>

<p>Commet, is now a days a better solution. But often hard to implement. I used <a href="http://www.pusher.com" rel="nofollow">pusher</a> for this type of stuff. You can push messages to (all) clients connected and say there is new info. And then they will update or with the message comes also the new info</p>
