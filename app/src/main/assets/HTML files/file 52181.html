<p>Let's say you have the string "Here we are". It has length 11. You are letting <code>i</code> go all the way to the end of the string, but once <code>i</code> reaches <code>4</code>, that string at index <code>i * 3</code> (12) is not defined.  Instead, you shouldn't go farther than <code>i</code> divided by 3 (rounding down).  This is how you would do that:</p>

<pre><code>msg = input('Message? ')
for i in range((len(msg) // 3) + 1):
   (i) = (i*3)
   print(msg[i], end=' ')
</code></pre>
