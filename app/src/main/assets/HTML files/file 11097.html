<p><code>-[NSObject copy]</code> is declared to return <code>id</code>, a type is assignable to any object pointer.  That's why you don't get an error or a warning.</p>

<p>If you override <code>copy</code> in <code>@interface Car</code>, declaring it to return <code>Car *</code>, you'll get a compiler warning on your bogus assignment.</p>
