<p>You may try just create a new stand-alone stage with a single  embedded browser and use a lot of html pages to compose your help system.
To not have to deal with those lot of files, you can put all into a single jar file and call it from your application. 
I think it can be used by any kind of application, changing only the html content. 
Is it?</p>
