<p>Without seeing your code it's hard to figure out what the best solution is. I think the best way (depending on the complexity of your app) would be to have a controller class between your model and views that would update the model and alert the views to the change in a single method. This is sort of an Observer pattern. Alternatively, you could have an update method in the model that calls a method in Class B to let it know that there's a model update. This would require the model to hold pointers to your instances of Class A and Class B.</p>
