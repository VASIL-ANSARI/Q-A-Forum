<p>After digging around in the source code I found this: The <em>money</em> gem defines the <code>cattr_accessor</code> helper methods (see in file YOUR_GEM_DIR/collectiveidea-money-1.7.4/lib/support/cattr_accessor.rb) as does active_support (see in file YOUR_GEM_DIR/activesupport-3.2.8/lib/active_support/core_ext/class/attribute_accessors.rb).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the implementation in the <em>money</em> gem differs from the one in active_support. And in your case, the <em>money</em> gem has been loaded after active_support and overwrote the *good* active_support implementation.</p>

<p>You can "fix" it by making sure that the <em>money</em> gem is loaded before active_support. If you post more details about your application, I can tell you how to do that...</p>

<p>However, the <em>money</em> gem seems to be pretty outdated, so I suggest you replace it with something that is more recent and actively maintained...</p>
