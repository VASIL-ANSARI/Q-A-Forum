<p>You can write maintainable queries that additionally are fast by using the pg/temporal extension:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeff-davis/PostgreSQL-Temporal" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jeff-davis/PostgreSQL-Temporal</a></p>

<pre><code>create index on events using gist(period(start_date, end_date));

select *
from events
where period(start_date, end_date) @&gt; :date;

select *
from events
where period(start_date, end_date) &amp;&amp; period(:start, :end);
</code></pre>

<p>You can even use it to disallow overlaps as a table constraint:</p>

<pre><code>alter table events
add constraint overlap_excl
exclude using gist(period(start_date, end_date) WITH &amp;&amp;);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>write all possible from, to and day/month/year combinations - not maintable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's actually more maintainable than you might think, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from events
join generate_series(:start_date, :end_date, :interval) as datetime
on start_date &lt;= datetime and datetime &lt; end_date;
</code></pre>

<p>But it's much better to use the above-mentioned period type.</p>
