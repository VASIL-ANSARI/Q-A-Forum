<p>(Sorry for answering with a question, but you might genuinely find this experiment informative) What happens when you implement dog as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class Dog : IAnimal
{

public virtual void MakeSound()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Woof");
}

//...
</code></pre>

<p>Note the "virtual"</p>
