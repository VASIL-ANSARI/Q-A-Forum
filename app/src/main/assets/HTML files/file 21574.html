<p>You can change the packing in ctypes as described <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html#structure-union-alignment-and-byte-order">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, Structure and Union fields are aligned in the same way the C compiler does it. It is possible to override this behavior be specifying a <em>pack</em> class attribute in the  subclass definition. This must be set to a positive integer and specifies the maximum alignment for the fields. This is what #pragma pack(n) also does in MSVC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For your example this would be:</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import *

class abc(Structure):
    _pack_ = 1
    _fields_ = [
        ('r1',c_ubyte),
        ('r2',c_ubyte),
        ('p1',c_ubyte),
        ('id',c_uint)]
</code></pre>
