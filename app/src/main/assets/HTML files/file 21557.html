<p>here's a suggestion based on your explanation. Please remember that I'm typing it all by hearts and it's likely to have a few typos.</p>

<p>STEP 1: in my main activity (class A), i call a method (in class B) that creates dinamically several buttons.</p>

<pre><code>public class A extends Activity implements OnClickListener{
      private ArrayList&lt;Buttons&gt; mybuttons = new ArrayList&lt;Butons&gt;

      // ... at some point you call B
      mybuttons.addAll(b.createButton(this));
           // createButtons should receive an OnClickListener as parameter to set on the buttons
           // createButtons returns a List&lt;Buttons&gt; that you add to your list.
           // note that it's NOT a static list, and that the list is part of the Activity, the Activity can hold reference to its views without problem

}
</code></pre>

<p>STEP 2: When users click one of these buttons i call a method (in class C) that check if users "did somethings".</p>

<p>STEP 3: If users did somethings, from Class C i call a method (in class D) that disables all the buttons i created in class B.</p>

<pre><code>  // because A implements the OnClickListener, the OnClick is called inside A
  onClick(View v){
        // call the C to check. and make it return a boolean (true or false)
       if(c.CheckStuff()){
           // disable your buttons.
           for(Button btn:mybuttons) {  btn.setEnabled(false);  }
        }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Question: What's the right way to reach, from class D, the buttons created in class B</p>

<p>answer: you don't have to, to be fair, if D is only disabling the buttons is only that ONE line I typed. If it's doing more stuff, you can pass <code>mybuttons</code> to D, but I urge to not keep a permanent reference of it inside D, that's because D is not part of the activity life-cycle.</p>
