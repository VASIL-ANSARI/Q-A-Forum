<p>In your <code>MouseMove</code> handler, you just want to store the points where you <em>will</em> draw the lines (but don't draw anything at that time). At the end of that handler, call <code>InvalidateRect</code> to tell Windows that your window needs re-painting. Windows will (eventually) respond to that with a <code>WM_PAINT</code> message. When you receive the WM_PAINT message, retrieve the points and do the actual drawing.</p>

<p>If you're doing anything other than bare Win32 programming, chances are that whatever framework you're using will handle a few bits and pieces of that for you, but the general structure normally remains roughly the same.</p>
