<p>Ok here's an example as requested. Let's say I have a User data model, it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Some Name',
  email: 'someemail@some.com',
  age: 21
}
</code></pre>

<p>They way you currently have it setup you'd have to have SET_USER_NAME, SET_USER_EMAIL, SET_USER_AGE actions. No need for all those when you can have an UPDATE_USER action that receives an object of the updated values as an argument.</p>

<p>To set a new name for the first user you would call the UPDATE_USER action like </p>

<p><code>updateUser(1, { name: 'New Name' })</code></p>

<p>In the Users reducer you'd update the users state (an array of users) like</p>

<pre><code>function updateUser(usersState, id, attrs) {
  return usersState.map(user =&gt;
    user.id === id ?
    Object.assign({}, user, attrs) :
    user
  );
}
</code></pre>
