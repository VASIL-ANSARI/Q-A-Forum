<p>Your JSON is an array of dictionaries.  Your problem is this line:</p>

<pre><code>for location in JSON as! Dictionary&lt;String,AnyObject&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>This should be:</p>

<pre><code>for location in JSON as! [Dictionary&lt;String,AnyObject&gt;] {
</code></pre>

<p>which can also be written as:</p>

<pre><code>for location in JSON as! [[String: AnyObject]] {
</code></pre>

<p>The cast in this case applies to <code>JSON</code>; you are not casting the object that is being retrieved from the JSON array.</p>

<p>When you do this, <code>location</code> will have the type <code>Dictionary&lt;String,AnyObject&gt;</code> (also known as <code>[String: AnyObject]</code>).</p>
