<p>I don't think there is a good solution to this. Even your solution doesn't really work. Just because you were once able to store a certain amount of data doesn't mean you will always be able to store that amount of data. The quota isn't constant. For instance, in Chrome it's <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/offline_storage" rel="nofollow">roughly 10% of free hard drive space</a>, which clearly can change over time.</p>

<p>If possible, the best solution would be to make your app gracefully handle the case where the quota is exceeded. Because it will happen no matter how you design your app.</p>
