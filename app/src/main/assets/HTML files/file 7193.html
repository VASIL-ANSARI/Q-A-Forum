<p>It's definitely possible, but Apple <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html" rel="nofollow">advises not putting a <code>UITableView</code> inside another <code>UITableView</code></a> (it makes touch tracking and behavior significantly more complex).</p>

<p>The best solution depends on your exact situation, but if the sub-view contains a lot of data, you can move it off into it's own modal view, or you can create a static or semi-static view that is embedded inside your <code>UITableViewCell</code> when that cell is selected.</p>
