  <p>Should every Actor have a Reference to the Level where all other Objects are stored and detect the collision on his own or should i have a Manager with the Level as reference?</p>

<p>It depends on your game, for example, games like this: <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-superjumper" rel="nofollow">SuperJumper</a>.  </p>

<p>With very simple collisions (Platforms/Squirrels/Coins/etc only collide with Bob, but they don't collide with each other) are easily handled within the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-superjumper/blob/master/core/src/com/badlogicgames/superjumper/World.java" rel="nofollow">World</a> class. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>//for example, Bob colliding with squirrels
private void checkSquirrelCollisions(){
    int len = squirrels.size();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++){
        Squirrel squirrel = squirrels.get(i);
        if (squirrel.bounds.overlaps(bob.bounds)){
            bob.hitSquirrel();
            listener.hit();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But a more complex Game which had Enemies/Bullets/etc that collide with Each Other/Walls/Player/etc would find a cleaner code if each one handled its own collisions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I do the collision detection inside the Actor.act(delta) method or between Actor.act() and Actor.draw()?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, as the collisions take an important role in the Entity behaviour (for example bouncing, stopping movement, etc). It would be better to have it inside the <code>Actor.act(delta)</code> method.</p>
