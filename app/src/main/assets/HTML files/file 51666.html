<p>Steffan:
You need to provide columns of all tables in your problem and business logic.
What rule describes "Old best before date"?  Is the "New Best Before date" always greater than sysdate?  In addition, is the query to determine the "Old best before date" always firing before a "New best before date" has been committed?</p>
