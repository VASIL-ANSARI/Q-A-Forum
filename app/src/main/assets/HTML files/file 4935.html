<p>In my opinion, you really only want to use WCF channels on the client if you are using non-web WCF bindings on the server.</p>

<p>In your case you are not even using .Net on the server so I think WCF is going to cause you a whole lot of pain.</p>

<p>I suggest you simply use the HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse classes in System.Net.  If you do that you can also take advantage of the built in caching that is provided by WinINet cache.  If you set the caching policy in the client Http client you will get all the caching behaviour you need for free.</p>
