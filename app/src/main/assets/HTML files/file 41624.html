<p>After careful reading of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SysServices/Articles/providing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000853-98551" rel="nofollow">Apple's documentation</a>, I found the answer: My service app's plist file was missing a key under the Services section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;NSReturnTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;NSStringPboardType&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I only had the opposite <code>NSSendTypes</code> key, which lets you send data from the client app to the service. This one is needed to send the modified text back (in the other direction). </p>

<p>It is weird because, Apple's documentation seems to imply that specifying these two is no longer necessary since 10.6 (Snow Leopard).</p>
