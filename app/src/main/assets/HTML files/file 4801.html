  <p>@fred: Glad you like it. Are you using
  the newest version of bPopup?</p>
  
  <p>Solution: Create a function on the
  page which opens the popup:</p>
  
  <p>function closeBPopup() {
  $(selector).bPopup().close() }</p>
  
  <p>Then you can trigger it inside your
  iframe whenever you are done doing
  your stuff with:</p>
  
  <p>parent.closeBPopup();</p>
