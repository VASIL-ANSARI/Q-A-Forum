<p>This question is just a reference to myself and to whomever gets here while searching for a solution to this issue.</p>

<p>The <code>Copy Local</code> in the reference was set to <code>True</code> but the <code>DLL</code> was not copied to the build folder. </p>

<p>Since I used this resource library only in <code>XAML</code>, I had to add a <code>using</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>using ResourceLibrary;
</code></pre>

<p>in the referencing code (actually, the code that called the referencing code, which was either the app or the unit-test)</p>

<p>This made the <code>DLL</code> created in the destination build directory.</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>Sometimes even <code>using ResourceLibrary</code> doesn't work. The solution is creating some empty static method in the code-behind of the <code>ResourceLibrary</code>:</p>

<pre><code>namespace ResourceLibrary {
    public static class ReferencePoint {
        public static ReferToMe() {}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And calling it from the referencing code:</p>

<pre><code>ReferencePoint.ReferToMe();
</code></pre>
