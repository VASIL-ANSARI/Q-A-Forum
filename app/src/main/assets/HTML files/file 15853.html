<p>There is no problem with the components. There is a problem with your design. You're doing the long-running queries and the updates of the charts in a single method run in the event dispatch thread. By doing so, the EDT is completely blocked and can't repaint anything until all the queries have been run and all the charts have been generated. </p>

<p>Use a background thread to execute the queries, and generate a chart, in the EDT, each time one query is finished. The SwingWorker class helps doing that. Read <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html" rel="nofollow">its API doc</a>, and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/" rel="nofollow">the tutorial</a> about concurrency in Swing.</p>
