<p>In the first log you've included, it only shows a commit with openSearcher=false.  This ensures that the data is properly flushed, but doesn't make it searchable.  This is likely happening because of the autoCommit section of your config.</p>

<p>The config snippet you pasted shows that autoSoftCommit is also there with a maxTime of one second but the log doesn't show any soft commits.  Without seeing the entire config, it's not possible to say whether that's actually active or not.  It is probably commented out.</p>
