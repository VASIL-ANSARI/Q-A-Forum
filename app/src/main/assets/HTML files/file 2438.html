<p>Unfortunately, I've been unable to find a lightweight CMS in <em>any</em> language.  </p>

<p>Java has the JSR 170 Java Content Repository specification, with Jackrabbit being the reference impelementation. Unfortunately, my experience has been that it is neither lightweight nor easy to learn from. </p>

<p>You might try looking at some of the version control systems and filesystems though: their functionality is overlapping and may resemble yours. </p>
