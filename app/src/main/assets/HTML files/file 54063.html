<p>Your code is not very readable if you insert ternary operators inside a for loop declaration as you're attempting.</p>

<p>It would be far more readable to produce <em>two</em> for loops, one of which is entered depending on the condition.</p>

<pre><code>if (bool)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NB_MAX; i++)
    {
        body(i);
    }
}
else
{
    for (int i = NB_MAX - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    {
        body(i);
    }
}
</code></pre>
