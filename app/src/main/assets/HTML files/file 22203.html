<p>A point cloud is just that. If you dont have the face connectivity information there is no way to compute it. Well there is but it is an algorithmic problem. If your point cloud is very dense then in order to visualize your data you probably dont have to compute the faces. You can visualize the points as they are. You can use the particle system in three.js to get an idea of your data. Take a look at the example webgl_buffergeometry_particles.html</p>
