CASE

<p>If Give or/and Quanity is other type than varchar you might need to convert them to varchar so query looks like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
Id,
CASE 
WHEN Give IS NOT NULL and Quanity IS NOT NULL THEN convert(varchar(50),Give) + '/' + convert(varchar(50),Quanity)
WHEN Give IS NOT NULL and Quanity IS NULL THEN Give
WHEN Give IS NULL and Quanity IS NOT NULL THEN Quanity
WHEN Give IS NULL and Quanity IS NULL THEN NULL
END as 'Give/Quanity'
from
Table
</code></pre>
