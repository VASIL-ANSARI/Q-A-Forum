<p>Maybe this will help you: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html#postDelayed%28java.lang.Runnable,%20long%29" rel="nofollow">Handler.postDelayed</a></p>

<p>With <code>Handler</code>s you can post <code>Runnable</code>s to be executed at some time in the future.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility to register at android's alarm service, but that's not what you want, i guess.</p>
