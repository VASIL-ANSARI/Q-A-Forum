<p>You are only printing out one match:</p>

<pre><code>if matches:
    print "Here is what is inside %s = %s" % (file,matches[0])
</code></pre>

<p>instead of all of them</p>

<pre><code>if matches:
    for match in matches:
        print "Here is what is inside %s = %s" % (file,match)
</code></pre>
