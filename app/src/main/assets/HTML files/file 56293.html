<p>The problem comes from the construction of the <code>Request</code> object : by default, the second parameter is the data that you want to pass along with the request. Instead, you have to specify that you want to pass headers. This is the correct way to do it :</p>

<pre><code>import urllib2
url = 'https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/-/activities/heart/date/2016-6-14/1d/1sec/time/00:00/23:59.json'
hdr = {'Authorization': 'Bearer (token)'}
req = urllib2.Request(url,headers=hdr)
f = urllib2.urlopen(req)
</code></pre>

<p>This wields a 401 on my side, but should work with your token.</p>

<p>You can have more informations on urllib2 (and the Request class) <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>However, I suggest you take a look at <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow">Requests</a>, which is in my opinion easier to use, and very well documented.</p>

<p>Hope it'll be helpful.</p>
