<p>Basically, you should just use render targets.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> need the back-buffer, you can use <code>GetBackBufferData</code>. But it only works on the HiDef profile.</p>

<p>If you need to change the <code>RenderTargetUsage</code> of the back-buffer, you need to respond to <code>PreparingDeviceSettings</code> and modify <code>GraphicsDeviceInformation.PresentationParameters.RenderTargetUsage</code>. (This was explained in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/11/21/rendertarget-changes-in-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that changing this away from the default is not recommended. The correct solution is to fix the order in which you set and draw to your render targets.</p>
