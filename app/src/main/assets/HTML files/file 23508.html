<p>I would say you should use a service for your background processing but if you've chosen a fragment for a specific reason you can stick with that. The way you should notify the activity from either a fragment or a service that might have a different lifecycle from the activity would be through a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html" rel="nofollow">BroadcastReceiver</a>. With this method the activity can <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#registerReceiver%28android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter%29" rel="nofollow">register</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#unregisterReceiver%28android.content.BroadcastReceiver%29" rel="nofollow">unregister</a> a BroadcastReceiver during its own lifecycle callback. From the fragment or service you just <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#sendBroadcast%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow">send the broadcast</a> and forget about it. If an activity is listening for the broadcast it will receive it, if not nothing will happen.</p>
