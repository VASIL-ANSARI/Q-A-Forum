<p>Ok, if every region is a table cell, so what you need to do is to create an empty cell at the points you want to change content, them you declare an id for this  (cell), and use pure JS or jquery (easier), to change its content. Like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td id="was_L"&gt;

...

$("#was_L").val('15')

....
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you also have to set size of this cell using style to keep the table looking fine. Like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td id="was_L" style="width:100px; height:100px"&gt;
</code></pre>
