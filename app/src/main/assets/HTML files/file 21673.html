<p>No, it's a difference between C++03 and C++11. All streams have a conversion operator that enables code using <code>if (s)</code> and <code>while (s)</code>. In C++03 this is usually <code>operator void*()</code> or something similar.</p>

<p>In C++11 we have explicit operators, where an <code>explicit operator bool()</code> works for <code>if (s)</code>, but not for <code>cout &lt;&lt; s</code>. </p>
