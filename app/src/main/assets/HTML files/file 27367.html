<p>I use an Xcode Workspace all the time and haven't noticed any changes from Xcode 4 WRT include paths.</p>

<p>I always do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put all projects in my <code>~/Source</code> folder so they are all at the same level (i.e. they are all siblings).</li>
<li>Create an Xcode project and test it before adding it to the Xcode Workspace.</li>
<li><p>I always manually set the <code>Header Search Path</code> in the project settings for any project that uses another project; for example:</p>

<pre><code>$(PROJECT_DIR)/../OtherProject1/include
$(PROJECT_DIR)/../OtherProject2/include
/opt/local/include
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I never have to set <code>Library Search Path</code> as the binaries/libraries are always put into the same directory in the <code>DerivedData</code> folder.</p></li>
</ul>
