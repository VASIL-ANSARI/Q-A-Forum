<p>You should only remove the cookie is <code>r</code> is true:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteCookie(name) {
    var r = confirm("Are you sure you want to clear your score!");
    if (r) {
        document.cookie = name + '=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT;';
        alert("Your score has been cleared!");
    }
    else {
        window.location="javascript:history.go(0)";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how I've moved that document.cookie line into the <code>if</code>? That way it'll only be run if the user hits the okay button. I've also refactored your logic code.</p>
