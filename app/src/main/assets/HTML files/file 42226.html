<p>Okay, </p>

<p>Because my question was essentially "What is the best way to get angular and node to respond to Facebook with the correct page meta". I am now in a position to post my answer to this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As stated above I think that using the phantom.js method described above requires phantom to be installed and to run as a separate process on the node.js server. (Can anyone confirm or deny this?)</p></li>
<li><p>For my situation I just wanted a user to be able to post a link from the site onto Facebook and for Facebook to return a nice looking link using open graph meta. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>With that in mind I decided to skip the phantom.js step from the solution in the tutorial above. Instead I rolled some code which essentially saves an HTML snippet into the DB when a user hits a page. The HTML snippet just contains the meta tags I need for Facebook. I then use the last part of the above tutorial to direct Facebook bots to my saved HTML snippet.</p>

<p>It seems to work pretty well.</p>
