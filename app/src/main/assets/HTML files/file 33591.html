<p>There's no boxing, but you are instead just getting a method call instead, which is just a different way of doing it.  It's not really going to save you time from a performance perspective.  All you're doing is calling <code>Convert.ToInt32(object)</code>, which the implementation of is:</p>

<pre><code> public static int ToInt32(object value) {
     return value == null? 0: ((IConvertible)value).ToInt32(null);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>(see here: <a href="http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/convert.cs#3a271a647f117003" rel="nofollow">http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/convert.cs#3a271a647f117003</a>)</p>

<p>So if anything, you're actually <em>decreasing</em> your performance because of the various operations happening in the implementation of <code>Convert.ToInt32(object)</code>, which you wouldn't have if you just cast the value in the first place.</p>

<p>You're trying to micro-optimise, and actually making the number of <em>total</em> IL instructions executed <em>increase</em>, because LINQPad won't show you the IL of the methods you're calling.</p>
