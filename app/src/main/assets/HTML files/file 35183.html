  <p>in my main I [want to] do something like this: <code>Rational r3 = new Rational(r1);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not cloning, this is making a constructor that takes a <code>Rational</code> as a parameter. You can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Rational(Rational other) {
    n = other.n;
    d = other.d;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would let you use the code to construct new instances of <code>Rational</code> from existing instances.</p>

<p>Note: It appears that both <code>n</code> and <code>d</code> in your class are exposed to users of your class as public variables. This is not ideal, because you have no control over the modifications that the users of your class may do to its instance variables. A better approach is to make them <code>private</code>, and add getters and setters to your class. This approach would let you detect attempts to set denominator to zero, which may be desirable.</p>
