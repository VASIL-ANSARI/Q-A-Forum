<p>I think a <code>class</code> with public variables comes very close to a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<pre><code>final class Person {
   String name;
   int age;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So there is no need to add something like <code>structs</code> if this type of functionality is already covered by classes.</p>
