<pre><code>var foo = myarray[myarray.length - 1];
</code></pre>

<p>The preferred term is element, rather than key.</p>

<p>EDIT: Or do you mean the last index?  That is <code>myarray.length - 1</code>.  Keep in mind, JavaScript arrays can only be indexed numerically (though arrays are also objects, which causes some confusion).</p>
