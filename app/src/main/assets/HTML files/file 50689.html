<p>By editing the text in the textboxes you do not change the <code>ObservableCollection</code> but you change one of the objects inside the collection. The collection is not aware of changing the internal(!) state of one the objects in it. Those changes can be captured by the <code>PropertyChanged</code> event of your <code>ConfigObject</code> class.</p>
