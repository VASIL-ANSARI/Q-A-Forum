<p>It sounds like the "following" property should be the property of a user rather than a TV show.</p>

<p>Your database should record the association between users and which shows they are following. So, if a user decides to follow a show, you save a persistent association in the database between that user and that show, and then the next time you query the database the state will be consistent.</p>
