<p>Here is the answer after extra discussion. Much simpler after taking into account the feedback.</p>

<p>However, I just focused on the carry bit as an example of how to address each bit in your statusRegister. Not sure if you need us to expand on the other bits.</p>

<p>So updating the register would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>bool carry = result &lt; Math.Max(varA, varB);
statusRegister |= (ushort)((carry) ? 0x1 : 0x0); //set the carry bit
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on your situation you may or may not need to clear the status register between iterations. If so, you could so something like:</p>

<pre><code>statusRegister &amp;= 0xFFFE; //clear the carry bit first
statusRegister |= (ushort)((carry) ? 0x1 : 0x0); //then set the carry bit
</code></pre>
