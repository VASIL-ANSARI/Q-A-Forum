<p>I think i have found an <strong>workaround</strong> of this problem but i do not know of any consequences this may cause as of yet.<br>
at line number 191 in ssp.class.php
I changed</p>

<pre><code>$columnSearch[] = "`" . $column['db'] . "` LIKE " . $binding;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>$columnSearch[] = "`" . $column['db'] . "` LIKE '%" . $str ."%'";
</code></pre>

<p>this will remove the binding_0 and i am manually adding the string that is searched, enclosed in % as i have to do only partial search.</p>

<p>I am not sure if this will cause any error with any other plugin i might use hence i do need a better solution if possible</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>This method gives an error when searching from both, the universal search box and the individual search box. So I need a better solution.</p>
