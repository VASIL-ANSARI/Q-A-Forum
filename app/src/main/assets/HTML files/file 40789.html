<p>Create the following two methods and add the property. Comment the button "Touch Down" event to the <code>touchDown:</code> method and the "Touch Up Inside" event to the <code>touchUp:</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSDate *touchDownTime;

- (IBAction)touchDown:(id)sender {
    self.touchDownTime = [NSDate date];
}

- (IBAction)touchUp:(id)sender {
    NSTimeInterval timeDown = [self.touchDownTime timeIntervalSinceNow];
    NSLog(@"'timeDown: %0.1f sec", timeDown);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to do something every second (or some interval) start a timer in <code>touchDown</code> and invalidate in <code>touchUp</code>.</p>
