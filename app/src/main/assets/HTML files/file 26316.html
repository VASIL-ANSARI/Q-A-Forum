<p>The error is on the expression <code>c.high0</code>.</p>

<p>If you look at what <code>c</code> is, it's one of the elements of a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>for c in zip(cities) :
</code></pre>

<p>And that means it's a tuple. That's what <code>zip</code> does: it takes an iterable of sequences, and turns it into an iterable of tuples, where each tuple has one member of each sequence.</p>

<p>If you can explain what you expected each <code>c</code> to be, or why you're calling <code>zip</code>, we could probably explain how to do it properly.</p>
