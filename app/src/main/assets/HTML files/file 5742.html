<p>This problem also exists in C. If you're using integers like this, you can't use a sentinel (as you've discovered). What most people do is define the first argument as the size instead. So your prototype might looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *)createNumberArrayWithInts:(NSUInteger)length, ...
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious problem with this kind of design is that the compiler can't check it. If you make a mistake with the size, you could be in trouble, but this is the same exact kind of problem you'd have in C even if you passed an array of ints or something like that. It's up to the caller to make sure that size is correct.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to have an illegal int as the sentinel. So, choose something like MAX_INT or whatever. When you find that, stop reading the list. Again, however, you can't really get the compiler to warn about that...</p>
