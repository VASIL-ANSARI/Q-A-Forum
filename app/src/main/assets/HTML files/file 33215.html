<p>This line isn't doing what you think.</p>

<pre><code>if(5.919&lt;a&lt;=12.056 &amp;&amp; 2.340&lt;b&lt;=2.347 &amp;&amp; 2.380&lt;c&lt;=2.648)
</code></pre>

<p>to do what you seem to want, you would need to change it to:</p>

<pre><code>if(5.919&lt;a&amp;&amp; a&lt;=12.056 &amp;&amp; 2.340&lt;b&amp;&amp; b&lt;=2.347 &amp;&amp; 2.380&lt;c&amp;&amp; c&lt;=2.648)
</code></pre>

<p>same for this line:</p>

<pre><code>else if(a&lt;=5.662 &amp;&amp; 2.340&lt;b&lt;=2.438 &amp;&amp; c&lt;=2.16)
</code></pre>

<p>that needs to be changed to:</p>

<pre><code>else if(a&lt;=5.662 &amp;&amp; 2.340&lt;b &amp;&amp; b &lt;=2.438 &amp;&amp; c&lt;=2.16)
</code></pre>

<p>When you write this:</p>

<pre><code>2.340 &lt;b &lt;= 2.347
</code></pre>

<p>what C and C++ understand is <code>(2.30 &lt; b) &lt;= 2.347</code> and that is always true (1 in C) for all values of b because <code>(2.30 &lt; b)</code> is either 0 or 1, which is always less or equal than 2.347. This is arcane and backwards, but it is how C and C++ see the world. I'm sure that this will only bite you once, and this was your turn.</p>

<p>Also, it is bad practice to mix <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> with <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code>, make a choice about how you want to do your I/O and stick to it, mixing them brings other subtle bugs that are difficult to troubleshoot. </p>

<p>For the final part of your question, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;string.h&gt;
int main(void){
    char answer[16];
    printf("Yes or No\n");
    scanf("%s",answer);
    if (strncmp(answer,"Yes",3)==0){
        printf("yes\n");
    }else{
        printf("no\n");
    }
}
</code></pre>
