<p>CPython, the standard implementation of Python, doesn't do much optimization; it is a pretty straightforward translation of source code to bytecode. There are a few optimizations thrown in (elimination or hoisting of code under <code>if __debug__</code> being one of them) and I do believe there's a peephole optimizer of some kind, but I assume the compilation phase is meant to be reasonably quick, which precludes doing a lot of analysis.</p>

<p>Maintainability also seems key to the core Python developers. Here is <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/dev/755165" rel="nofollow">a thread from 2009</a> in which a patch for dead code removal is considered, then rejected, because it would make the compiler less maintainable.</p>

<p>If you want high performance, you want something other than CPython; maybe PyPy would help. Python in general is optimized to save programmer time, not runtime. If you don't want dead code in your bytecode, don't put it in your source code.  :-)</p>
