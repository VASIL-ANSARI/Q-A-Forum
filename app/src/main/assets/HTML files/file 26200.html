<p>First I would suggest one database with both tables, however if there are constraints that are required for that design, then you would have to make content providers to handle both databases if it's in one application or if you have to share the data across applications, then each application should have a content provider.  Both content providers should be set android:exported="true" in your manifest.</p>
