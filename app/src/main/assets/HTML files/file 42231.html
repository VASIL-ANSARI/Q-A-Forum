<p>I found what was the problem:
I simply deleted the tomcat6 working directory: <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/work/Catalina</code> 
To do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>stop tomcat: /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop</li>
<li>delete the working directory <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/work/Catalina</code> . Of course, double check you are in the working directory and not in Catalina application directory!</li>
<li>restart tomcat: /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
IT may take a while as it must rebuild the temporary directory. In my case, it did not restart, and I could see that tomcat was not restarted and a PID was already existing (using the command <code>/etc/init.d/tomcat6 status</code>). I simply rebooted my server, to have the pid lock released.</li>
</ol>
