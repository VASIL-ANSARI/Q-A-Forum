<p>First, I think you need to learn a bit more about Java, especially inheritance (I'm referencing your constructor problem.</p>

<p>Answers to your questions :</p>

<ul>
<li>define your column names via a <code>private final static</code> attribute, assuming your column names don't change.</li>
<li>since your class extends <code>AbstractTableModel</code>, you can define a constructor for it, where you'll pass the data. Redefine the <code>getValueAt</code> method to allow the model to use the data you're passing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more advice :</p>

<ul>
<li>don't do what you're doing in <code>getColumnClass</code>. Normally, all elements in a column will have the same class, so do a <code>switch</code> on the column index to get the classes.</li>
<li>to add a <code>JCheckBox</code> in one of your columns, you'll have to use a custom <code>TableCellRenderer</code></li>
</ul>
