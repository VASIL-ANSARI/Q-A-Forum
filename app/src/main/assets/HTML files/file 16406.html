<p>You can't. You might gain insight from LLVM's document <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#ownership.restrictions.pass_by_writeback" rel="nofollow">Automatic Reference Counting</a>, specifically section 4.3.4. "Passing to an out parameter by writeback". However, there really isn't that much extra detail other than you can't do that (specifically, this isn't listed in the "legal forms"), which you've already figured out. Though maybe you'll find the rationale interesting.</p>
