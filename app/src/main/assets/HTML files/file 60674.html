<p>You're accessing outside the array in your loop. Your loop has as one iteration for each element in <code>planeVertices</code>. But you're incrementing <code>counter</code> 3 times each time through the loop. So about 1/3 of the way through all the loops <code>counter</code> will reach the end of the array, then you'll start writing outside the array, which causes undefined behavior.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to do. Why are you writing 3 different elements of the array each time through the loop? So it's not clear how to fix it. You could simply declare it 3 times as large:</p>

<pre><code>GLfloat planeVertices[verticesCount * 3];
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could declare it as a 2-dimensional array:</p>

<pre><code>GLfloat planeVertices[verticesCount][3];
</code></pre>

<p>Then your loop would do:</p>

<pre><code>planeVertices[counter][0] = length - half;
planeVertices[counter][1] = 0.0f;
planeVertices[counter][2] = width - half;
counter++;
</code></pre>
