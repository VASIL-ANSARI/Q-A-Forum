<p>The method called <code>Test</code> is a so-called <a href="http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-constructors" rel="nofollow">constructor</a> for the <code>Test</code> class. The constructor is the method that gets called when you write something like <code>new Test(...)</code>.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the <code>main</code> method is a <code>static</code> method, which means that it does not require an instance of the class Test to be called. This is not the case for the <code>run</code> method. <code>run</code> is an instance method, and to invoke it you need an instance of the <code>Test</code> class (the <code>obj</code> in your case). </p>
