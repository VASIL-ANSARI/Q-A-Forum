<p>It really depends on where the images are coming from. Are they being downloaded from the Internet (or imported from the user's library / camera) after the user installs the app, or are they bundled with the app from the App Store?</p>

<p>If the images are being downloaded / imported, the best solution is to store images in the filesystem following the recommendations in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1719/_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1719/_index.html</a></p>

<p>Basically, if the images cannot be replaced or recreated, store them in the <code>&lt;Application_Home&gt;/Documents</code> directory and do not set the <code>Do Not Backup</code> attribute. These items will be backed up to iCloud, and this data does persist for at least some amount of time even if the app is deleted from the device. (Remember that your users do not have unlimited iCloud space. Be responsible.)</p>

<p>If the images are bundled with the app, the best solution is to import them directly into your Xcode project and reference them from there. This way you know they are always available even if the user deletes and reinstalls the app.</p>

<p>I would definitely stay away from storing image data in the databased whenever possible. There are simply better, more efficient ways in most any scenario.</p>
