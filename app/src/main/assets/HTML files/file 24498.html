<p>I'm actually surprised this line works:</p>

<pre><code>require_once "/includes/include.php";
</code></pre>

<p>This refers to the root of your server's file system. You're mistakenly assuming PHP respects the document root of your website when constructing include paths.</p>

<p>You have to explicitly retrieve <code>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']</code> to find out where the website is running (something like <code>/var/www/mywebsite</code> or <code>/home/user/public_html</code> usually), and then construct the paths from there:</p>

<pre><code>define('ROOT_PATH', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']);
require_once ROOT_PATH.'/includes/include.php';
</code></pre>
