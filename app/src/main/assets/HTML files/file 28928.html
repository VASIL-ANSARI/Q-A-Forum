<p>you could use a custom target to execute whatever you want. custom targets are always considered out of date and run on every build.</p>

<pre><code>add_custom_target(RerunCmake ${CMAKE_COMMAND} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR})
add_dependencies(YourTarget RerunCmake)
</code></pre>

<p>this works fine with makefiles. but visual studio for example will nag you after every build asking to reload the project because the project files changed on disk.</p>

<p>maybe it would be better to make a custom target that just updates a header file with the correct date so cmake doesn't rerun on every build</p>
