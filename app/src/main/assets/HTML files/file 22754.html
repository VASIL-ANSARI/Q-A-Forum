<p>You could do that a bunch of ways.  One way is to create two sets, one with upcs and regular prices, the other with upcs and promo prices, and join those two sets, like this:</p>

<pre><code>select r.upc, r.price from
   (select upc, price from t where propertyCode = 'regular_price') r inner join
   (select upc, price from t where propertyCode = 'promo_price') p on
   r.upc = p.upc and
   r.price = p.price
</code></pre>
