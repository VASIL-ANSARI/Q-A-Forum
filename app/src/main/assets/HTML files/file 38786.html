<p>Short answer: Compare strings using <code>.equals</code> and not <code>==</code>.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<pre><code>    // ===== WHY DOES THIS WORK?
    if (collectionOfWords.get(i)=="\n")
        System.out.println("Found it!");
</code></pre>

<p>This works because you have two <code>"\n"</code> in your program. (One in your <code>.add("\n")</code> and one where you do <code>== "\n"</code>. Since these two strings are literals in your program, they will refer to the same object, i.e. a reference equality check (<code>==</code>) will work fine.</p>

<pre><code>    // ===== BUT THIS DOESN'T WORK???
    if (collectionOfWords.get(i)=="test")
            System.out.println("Found it!");
</code></pre>

<p>The words you're looking for in your text file doesn't exist in your program code. (They're not literals.) Which means that a string <code>"test"</code> loaded from the file and a the string literal <code>"test"</code> in your program are two different objects (though they contain the same value). To test if two different strings contain the same value, you compare them with equals:</p>

<pre><code>    if (collectionOfWords.get(i).equals("test"))
            System.out.println("Found it!");
</code></pre>
