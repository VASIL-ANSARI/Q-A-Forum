<p>Quite literally, "instantiation" or "initialization" (same thing) is when you CREATE the instance of a class.  So using a similar metaphor, the <code>Class</code> is the blueprint for the house, the <code>Initialization (init)</code> is when the construction crew builds the house, and the <code>Instance</code> is the finished house that you live in.</p>

<p>In your example above, that would be <code>var x = 5</code>.  The construction crew just built <code>x</code> and set it to <code>5</code>.  Now you can do whatever you want with your instance of <code>x</code>, like change it to <code>6</code>.  Your first example of telling everyone that <code>x</code> is going to be an <code>Int</code> is what the <code>Class</code> is for.</p>
