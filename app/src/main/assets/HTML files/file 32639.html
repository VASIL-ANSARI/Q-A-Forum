<p>This is usually caused by an aborted connect. You can verify this by checking the status:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Aborted_connects';
</code></pre>

<p>If this counter keeps increasing as you get the lost connections, that's a sign you're having a problem during connect.</p>

<p>One remedy that seems to work in many cases is to increase the timeout.  A suggested value is 10 seconds:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; SET GLOBAL connect_timeout = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Another common cause of connect timeouts is the reverse-DNS lookup that is necessary when authenticating clients.  It is recommended to run MySQL with the config variable in my.cnf:</p>

<pre><code>[mysqld]
skip-name-resolve
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your GRANT statements need to be based on IP address rather than hostname.</p>

  <p>It is likely the proxy will not work unless you are running BIG-IP 11.1 and MySQL 5.1, which were the versions I tested against. The MySQL protocol has a habit of changing.</p>

<p>I suggest you contact <a href="https://f5.com/support/product-support">F5 Support</a> and confirm that you are using a supported combination of versions.</p>
