<p>We did this at work to support some 3rd party interop scenarios and our process looked like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a WSDL for our WCF service via the wsdl.exe tool (we defined a basic HTTP version of our services because of the lack of eventing in Java),</li>
<li>Used an apache CXF tool, wsdl2java, to generate Java classes for the WSDL,</li>
<li>Used the autogen'd client definition as a wrapper to perform calls on the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd imagine in your case you'd do the exact opposite, using java2ws.exe in the Apache CXF framework to create your WSDL, then using wsdl.exe in the .Net framework to generate your c# classes (or other CLI classes...), then consuming those classes to accomplish whatever it is you have a client do.</p>
