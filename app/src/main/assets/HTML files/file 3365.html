<p>I imagine your best bet is to invoke a quicktime object in your web page. For playing mp3 files, your best bet is to serve a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_%28file_format%29" rel="nofollow">Winamp .pls style playlist with mimetype audio/x-scpls</a> that serves as a signpost to the mp3 files. Create an embedded quicktime object around it. Try the docs for quicktime:</p>
