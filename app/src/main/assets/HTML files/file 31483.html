<p>I think, it doesn't really matter where the file is in your IDE. All it matter is where the file will be during execution time, in the final bundle.</p>

<p>So, assuming , your <code>properties/</code> folder should become the root of the executed bundle.This way, as hibernate.cfg.xml is in <code>properties/</code>, then it should be in the root during execution time. Can you try by using</p>

<p><code>private static final String CFG_XML = "hibernate.cfg.xml";</code></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong></p>

<pre><code>Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure("hibernate.cfg.xml");
</code></pre>

<p>below this your code continues. in <code>hibernate.cfg.xml</code> I mentioned <code>&lt;mapping resource="pkg/name/of/mapping/file/file.hbm.xml" /&gt;</code></p>
