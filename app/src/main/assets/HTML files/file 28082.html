<p>C++ gets the <code>struct tm</code> type from C. According to the C standard, these elements of <code>struct tm</code> have certain ranges:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>C99 Â§7.23.1 Components of time</h3>
  
  <p>The <code>tm</code> structure shall contain at least the following members, in any order. The semantics of the members and their normal ranges are expressed in the comments.</p>

<pre><code>int tm_sec;   //seconds after the minute â [0, 60]
int tm_min;   //minutes after the hour â [0, 59]
int tm_hour;  //hours since midnight â [0, 23]
int tm_mday;  //day of the month â [1, 31]
int tm_mon;   //months since January â [0, 11]
int tm_year;  //years since 1900
int tm_wday;  //days since Sunday â [0, 6]
int tm_yday;  //days since January 1 â [0, 365]
int tm_isdst; // Daylight Saving Time flag
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These values can be safely cast to <code>int32_t</code>.</p>
