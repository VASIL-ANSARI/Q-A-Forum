<p>It's a known issue in Maven (<a href="https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-603" rel="nofollow">see here</a>).
Simplest workaround is to redefine this property in your POM:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;maven.build.timestamp&gt;${maven.build.timestamp}&lt;/maven.build.timestamp&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Although this could generate an error in IDE like Eclpise it's still working as a maven build. Alternatively you could redefine this property with your own name to avoid IDE warnings.</p>
