<p>In Abstract classes you can define abstract as well as non abstract methods. However the 1st concrete subclass of the Abstract class must implement those abstract methods. You cannot create instance of Abstract classes and they must be subclassed to some concrete class.</p>

<p><strong>Also note JLS states if abstract classes have all abstract method it is better to use interface.</strong></p>

<pre><code>Can anyone please explain what is the need of calling "area method" using
abstract class reference.
</code></pre>

<p>Concept is same as inheritance. We use abstract classes to avoid duplicate.</p>

<pre><code>What is the need of reference variable of an Abstract class here. I can get the
output without the reference variable of an abstract class.
</code></pre>

<p>Abstract class is used as a reference because you can take advantage of <strong>polymorphism</strong> here. If you call <code>area()</code> on the reference variable at runtime it will call the corresponding implementation of <code>Traingle</code> or <code>Rectangle</code> based on the actual instance type.</p>
