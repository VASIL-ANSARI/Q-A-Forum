<p>There is no "correct answer", but I would imagine most everyone would suggest using constants:
Put these in a common header file that any C file can include.</p>

<p><strong>exit_codes.h</strong></p>

<pre><code>#define EXIT_SUCCESS           0
#define EXIT_GENERAL_FAILURE   1
#define EXIT_OUT_OF_MEM        2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>whatever.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include "exit_codes.h"
void *p = malloc(100);
if (!p)
    exit(EXIT_OUT_OF_MEM);
</code></pre>
