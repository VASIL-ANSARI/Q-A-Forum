<p>There are a few different ways to tackle this problem. <code>cProfile</code> is great and comes with Python, however many people see multi-threaded profiling as an issue. One way of getting around this is by running separate instances of cProfile for each thread and then combining the results using <code>Stats.add</code>.</p>

<p>Should that not be as useful as you'd hoped, another alternative could be to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yappi/" rel="nofollow">Yappi</a>, which I've had success using for a few special multi-threaded cases. It's got great documentation so you shouldn't have too much trouble setting it up.</p>

<p>For memory specific profiling, check out <a href="http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy" rel="nofollow">Heapy</a>. But be warned, it may create some of the largest log files you've ever seen if your code is bad!</p>
