<p>you would need to change the css for <code>.btn</code> then. try adding it into a custom css inside the template settings page and add <code>!important</code> to the rules you would like to apply. </p>

<p>The magnifying glass is also with class <code>.btn</code> so it would work for all of your buttons. </p>

<p>i guess you don't want the <code>border-bottom: red</code> property!</p>
