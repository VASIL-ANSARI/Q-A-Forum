<p>I think this will do what you want.  It calculates the total number of meeting hours in the building for all the rooms.  It then calculates the total meeting hours.  If a room is available the second is less than the first:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT b.id, b.name,
       sum(timestampdiff(minute, rv.date_start, rv.date_end))/60 as MeetingHours,
       max(hours_end - hours_start)*count(distinct r.id) as BuildingHours
FROM buildings b JOIN
     information bi
     on b.id = bi.building_id
     rooms r
     ON b.id = r.building_id LEFT JOIN
     reservations rv
     ON rv.room_id = r.id AND
        '2014-08-09' between date(rv.date_start) AND date(rv.date_end)
GROUP BY b.id
HAVING MeetingHours is Null or MeetingHours &lt; BuildingHours;
</code></pre>
