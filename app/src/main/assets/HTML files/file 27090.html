<p>Don't stress too much about the exact language of the comments. You just want them to be clear so that whom ever comes behind you to maintain the code will understand what is going on. Don't worry about syntax for comments, it really isn't that important. </p>

<p>You could say: </p>

<pre><code>//get user input
//read user input
//take user input
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, it is one of the least important things to worry about. Just make sure that people know what you are doing. I'd focus on making the code itself clean and well-formatted, not the comments. It's important to have comments, as most programmers don't take the time to do it, but it isn't the most important thing. </p>

<p>It is more important to watch your verbiage when naming methods/classes/functions/variables. Not the comments. </p>
