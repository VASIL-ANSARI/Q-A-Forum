<p>I did something similar with combining Magnific and Colorbox.  Magnific has the ability to override some parts of its code without having to change the source, as <a href="http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html#faq" rel="nofollow">documented in the FAQ</a>.  In my case, it looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Prevent "Escape" from closing Magnific popup when Colorbox popup is open
$.magnificPopup.instance.close = function() {
  if ($("#colorbox").is(":visible")) {
    // Don't do anything with Magnific if Colorbox is doing its thing
    return false;
  } else {
    // Do what it would normally do
    $.magnificPopup.proto.close.call(this);
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>You would have change your <code>if</code> test to something PhotoSwipe-specific. Perhaps replacing that line with <code>if ($(".pswp--open").length &gt; 0) {</code> would work.  (That JavaScript counts (via jQuery) the number of elements with the <code>pswp--open</code> class on them, which appears, at least from the PhotoSwipe demo, to be a class that's added to the mark-up when it's opened.)</p>
