<p>It is possible to mail a <em>link</em> to a Google Map - just put the link into the E-Mail. </p>

<p>Other than that, I don't think you will be lucky. Google Maps uses extensive scripting. Scripting is not supported in E-Mails. </p>

<p>Google Maps has a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/" rel="nofollow">static maps API</a> that creates images, but I don't think they do directions on that - and distributing the generated images via E-Mail would probably violate their terms and conditions.</p>
