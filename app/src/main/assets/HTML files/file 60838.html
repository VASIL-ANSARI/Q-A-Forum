<p>opening PDF files is a little bit difficult. As I descriped in my request couple of weeks ago: 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38991330/photoshop-javascript-options-to-open-a-pdf-as-smart-object">Photoshop JavaScript: options to open a PDF as smart object</a></p>

<p>My workarround is to use an action (from the Actions panel) that opens the files (modal controle on, to set efficient PDF render) and also starts the script.</p>

<p>You could use the action to export as web JPG.</p>

<p>If you want to use the script, the <code>File</code> needs a full path.</p>

<pre><code>var destFile = new File ("~/Desktop/" + "web-" + doc.name + ".jpg");
</code></pre>

<p>Also the parameters for <code>exportDocument</code> are needed (non optional).</p>

<pre><code>doc.exportDocument(destFile, ExportType.SAVEFORWEB, options);
</code></pre>
