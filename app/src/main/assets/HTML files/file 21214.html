<p>Doh! As I was writing this, I spotted my problem and figured I'd go ahead and provide the answer in case anyone else ever does this. I needed to adjust my command to include the word <strong>test</strong> before specifying the directory, like so:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -I test test/unit/name_of_test.rb
</code></pre>
