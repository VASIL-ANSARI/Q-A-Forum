<p>For anyone coming across this, I had success with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>URI oldUri;
Uri newUri  = new Uri.Builder().scheme(oldUri.getScheme())
                    .encodedAuthority(oldUri.getRawAuthority())
                    .encodedPath(oldUri.getRawPath())
                    .query(oldUri.getRawQuery())
                    .fragment(oldUri.getRawFragment())
                    .build();
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, get each URI component and pass it to the builder (as there does not seem to be a way to pass in a whole URI string.</p>
