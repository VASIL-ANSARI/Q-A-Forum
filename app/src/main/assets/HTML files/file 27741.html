<p>Yes, it somewhat defeats the purpose of using prepared statements. Preparing allows the DB to pre-parse the query and get things ready for execution. When you do execute the statement, the DB simply slips in the values you're providing and performs the last couple steps. </p>

<p>When you prepare inside a loop like that, all of the preparation work gets thrown out and re-done each time. What you should have is:</p>

<pre><code>$obj = PDO::prepare("SELECT x,y,z FROM table1 WHERE x=:param1 AND y=:param2");
for ($x=0; $x&lt;100; $x++) {
    $obj-&gt;execute(array('param1'=&gt;$param1, 'param2'=&gt;$param2));
}
</code></pre>

<p>prepare once, execute many times.</p>
