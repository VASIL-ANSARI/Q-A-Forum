<p>After a further two hours of searching, I found a post that suggested making sure that all your HTML tags are in correct alignment.</p>

<p>The suggestion was that internet explorer is less able to deal with incorrectly formed HTML.</p>

<p>After checking my page using the HTML validator plugin for firefox I found I had a div tag out of alignment.</p>

<p>Once I fixed that everything started working correctly in internet explorer.</p>

<p>Leaving this here as it may help someone else who has the same issue.</p>
