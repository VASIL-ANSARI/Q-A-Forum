<p>You were <strong>increasing n by 1</strong> and <strong>dividing binary by 10 raised to n</strong> at same time. Due to this, you were not able to fetch the unit's digit of binary number after 1st iteration. To solve this issue, you need to get binary modulo 10 (not 10 raised to n) in each iteration and also keep the statement of binary divided by 10. </p>

<p>I have simplified and also made some small changes to your code to increase readability. Here is the corrected main method : </p>

<pre><code>public static void main (String[] args){
    java.util.Scanner read = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter a binary number: ");
    int binary = read.nextInt();
    int total = 0;
    int n = 0;
    int c = 0;
    int number = 0;
    while (binary != 0) {
        c = binary % 10;
        binary = binary / 10;
        number = c * (int)(Math.pow(2, n));
        total += number;
        ++n;
    }
    System.out.println("The decimal of the binary is " + total);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code is working and producing desired results. Let me know in case you have any further doubts.</p>
