<p>Don't get me wrong, that sounds like a plausible idea and you can probably get it running.  But I wonder if it is really going to be beneficial.  Will it cause a system to be faster? Give you more control?  Make development easier?</p>

<p>I would just look into using (or building) a system using well practiced MVC style coding standards, build a good DB structure, and tweak the heck out of Apache (or use something like Lighttpd).  You will have a lot more widespread acceptance of your code if you ever decide to make it open source, and if you ever need a hand with it another developer could step right in and pick up the keyboard.</p>

<p>Also, check out query caching in MySQL--you will see a similar (though not one-to-one) benefit from caching your query results server side with regard to your query example.  Even better that is stored in server memory so PHP/MySQL overhead is dropped AND you don't have to code it.</p>

<p>All of that aside, I do think it is possible.  =)</p>
