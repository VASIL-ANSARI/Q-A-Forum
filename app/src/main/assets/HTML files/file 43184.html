<p>Because you told it to, and it believes what you tell it. <code>convert_tz(UTC_TIMESTAMP(), 
@@session.time_zone,"+00:00")</code> says to take the current UTC time, pretend it's actually local time, and then convert it to UTC by adding the opposite of the local timezone offset. This is a nonsensical thing to do and gets a nonsensical result.</p>
