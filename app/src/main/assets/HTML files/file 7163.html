<p>To get all occurrences where t2 matches t1.id but not some other field do </p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.id, t2.id FROM table2 t2
INNER JOIN table1 t1 ON (t2.t1_id = t1.id AND not(t2.fieldx &lt;=&gt; t1.fieldx))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will also exclude rows where both <code>fieldx</code> are <code>null</code>.<br>
If you don't want that substitute the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> with <code>=</code>.</p>
