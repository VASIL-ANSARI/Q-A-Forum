<p>I've made this minimal example.
I removed plt.axis('auto') and replaced it with plt.ylim, which seems to work.
When I replace plt.ylim by plt.axis('auto'), it doesn't work very well.</p>

<pre><code>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import math
tempList = [20.3, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4, 20.4]
plt.plot(tempList)
plt.ylim(math.floor(min(tempList)), math.ceil(max(tempList)))
plt.show()
</code></pre>
