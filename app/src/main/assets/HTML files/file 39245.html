<p>As noted above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Composition is when one class contains members that are instances of other classes. The term Facade usually means that you are encapsulating a lot of logic behind the public members of a class. So notice that you can have composition without a Facade, if the composition members are all public. I won't get into the merit of a Facade without composition being valid, because that's a semantics labyrinth. BTW composition and interfaces are two different beasts, even if consider only Java or only Python.</p>
