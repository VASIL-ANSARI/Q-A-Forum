<p>Sounds like you need to put it in a background thread. I recommend using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">AsyncTask</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need to override <code>onPreExecute()</code>, <code>doInBackground()</code>, and <code>onPostExecute()</code> at the very minimum to accomplish what you are trying to do.</p>

<p><code>onPreExecute()</code> and <code>onPostExecute()</code> are executed on the UI thread so your dialogs can be shown in these methods.</p>

<p>I recommend <code>doInBackground()</code> to return a <code>boolean</code> so <code>onPostExecute()</code> can display the correct dialog.</p>
