<p>You want to write your query to minimize the amount of data returned. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 5, 9, 25, 68, 130)
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise the database is going to want to send you 100% of all data in the table on every request rather than just the 7 rows you're interested in.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>LIMIT 1,$offset</code> to get a single record <code>$offset</code> rows from the beginning of the result set. <strong><em>However, this is far less efficient.</em></strong> MySQL still computes 100% of the result set and then simply iterates through it until it gets to the Nth record.</p>

<p>Ideally, you also want to restrict your query to only return a finite set of columns rather than <code>*</code>. This will reduce the overhead of your application.</p>

<h3>edit</h3>

<p>In response to @serg's suggestion. <strong><em><code>ORDER BY RAND()</code> is literally the devil.</em></strong> You should never use it unless you are 1,000,000% certain that your entire result set [<em>disregarding</em> <code>LIMIT</code> clauses, LIMIT has no effect on how bad this is!] will never be larger than a few dozen rows and you're fine with completely throwing away all of your indexes.</p>

<p>Seriously, do not do it.</p>
