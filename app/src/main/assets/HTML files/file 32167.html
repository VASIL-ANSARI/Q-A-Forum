<p>Yes. You can build your initial query to find your element immediatelly.</p>

<p>If you don't need to search by text, you can mostly use CSS selectors for maximum readability and efficiency.</p>

<p>If, however, you need to search by text, you must use an XPath expression.</p>

<p>For example, your code could be simply</p>

<pre><code>WebElement menuItem = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(@class, 'x-list-menu-item') and contains(text(), 'aaaa')]"));
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the class finding with XPath is not exactly correct. Search for it online to find the right construct.</p>
