<p>There's a lot going on in your question without you actually asking any questions. As for your text problem though, System.out.println(); will always print to the console, wherever it may be. To add it to the JFrame, you have a variety of options. The one you probably want is to use a JLabel, unless you have a lot of text, in which case a JTextArea may be better suited, or if you intend to do something a little fancier than regular text you may want to draw it directly using the Graphics class and drawString(String). </p>
