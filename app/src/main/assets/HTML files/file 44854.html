<blockquote>
  <p>When you run this command, Capistrano will SSH to your server, enter
  the directory that you specified in the deploy_to variable, and create
  a special directory structure thatâs required for Capistrano to work
  properly. If something is wrong with the permissions or SSH access,
  you will get error messages. Look closely at the output Capistrano
  gives you while the command is running.</p>
