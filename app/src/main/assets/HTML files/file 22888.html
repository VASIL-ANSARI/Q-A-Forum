<p>There are a couple of ways:</p>

<p>LEFT JOIN</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.id, p.title
FROM properties p 
LEFT JOIN reservations r 
on p.id = r.fk_property_id 
where arrival &lt; '2013-06-29 14:00:00'
and departure &gt; '2013-07-14 10:00:00'
and r.id is null
</code></pre>

<p>However, since you're essentially performing an anti-semijoin, <code>NOT EXISTS</code> could be better for you:</p>

<pre><code>select p.id, p.title
from properties p 
where NOT EXISTS (
    select 1 
        from reservations r 
            where where arrival &gt; '2013-06-29 14:00:00'
                 and departure &lt; '2013-07-14 10:00:00'
                 and p.id = r.fk_property_id);
</code></pre>
