<p>I'm not quite sure what problem you are actually having. When you say you want "4x the color depth" what do you actually mean. Color depth normally means the number of bits per color channel (or per pixel), which is totally independent of the resolution of the image.</p>

<p>In terms of lookup table accuracy (which is resolution dependent), assuming you are using bilinear filtered texture inputs from the original texture, and filtered lookups into the transform table, then you are already linearly interpolating between samples in the lookup table. Interpolation of color channels will be at higher precision than the storage format; e.g. often fp16 equivalent, even for textures stored at 8-bit per pixel.</p>

<p>Unless you have a significant amount of non-linearity in your color transform (not that common) adding more samples to the lookup table is unlikely to make a significant difference to the output - the interpolation will already be doing a reasonably good job of filling in the gaps.</p>
