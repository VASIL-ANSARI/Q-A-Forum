<p>You can read about the keyword <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keywords/unsigned">unsigned in the C++ Reference</a>.</p>

<p>There are two different types in this matter, signed and un-signed. The default for integers is signed which means that they can have negative values.</p>

<p>On a 32-bit system an integer is 32 Bit which means it can contain a value of ~4 billion.</p>

<p>And when it is signed, this means you need to split it, leaving -2 billion to +2 billion.</p>

<p>When it is unsigned however the value <strong>cannot</strong> contain any negative numbers, so for integers this would mean 0 to +4 billion.</p>

<p>There is a bit more informationa bout this on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
