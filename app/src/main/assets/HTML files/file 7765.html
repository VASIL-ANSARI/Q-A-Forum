<p>I think that to answer this question, the contents of the aspx file are required, but I'll try to help. More than likely the element in your form, isapprovedCheckBox, is still set to the the tag asp:Text. As a result the system can't convert the textbox to a checkbox. </p>

<p>Could you include your aspx content as well?</p>
