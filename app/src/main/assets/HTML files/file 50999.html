<p>A <code>FULL JOIN</code> will do:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COALESCE(t1.Code, t2.Code) AS Code,
       COALESCE(t2.Quantity, t1.Quantity) AS Quantity
FROM TableA AS t1 
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB AS t2 ON t1.code = t2.code
</code></pre>

<p><code>COALESCE(t2.Quantity, t1.Quantity)</code> essentially implements your requirement for <em>'dominance'</em> of <code>TableB</code> over <code>TableA</code>: <code>Quantity</code> is picked up from <code>TableA</code> only in case there is <em>no matching record</em> in <code>TableB</code>.</p>

<p>For an explanation on how a <code>FULL JOIN</code> works you can have a look <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa213228%28v=sql.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FULL OUTER JOIN, includes all rows from both tables, regardless
  of whether or not the other table has a matching value.</p>
