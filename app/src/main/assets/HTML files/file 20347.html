<p>Hmm actually everything looks quite OK-ish. <code>db.players.findAll</code> with <code>where: { team_id: 1 }</code> should create a query with <code>WHERE players.team_id = '1'</code>. That's perfectly expected. Also, you <code>teams</code> won't have a <code>team_id</code> but an <code>id</code> instead. However, there is a good chance that <code>include</code> is broken atm. </p>
