<p>You can do this, using custom itemDelegates.</p>

<p>The way to success will be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Subclass <code>QAbstractItemDelegate</code>, reimplement <code>createEditor</code> and make sure it creates combobox You love.</li>
<li>use <code>setItemDelegateForColumn</code> and specify a column with your color content.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hint: you can even customize display of your color data, not only editing!</p>

<p>Now, let speak about setting only one column editable. You have a choice.</p>

<p>Way 1. Do it at model level. Let Your model returns proper flags in <code>flags(QModelIndex)</code> and make only Your column editable.</p>

<p>Way 2. View level. In this case You should create a "dumb" itemDelegate which does not create editor at all and assign it to all other columns.</p>

<p>Personally, I like way 1. But this is for You to choose.</p>
