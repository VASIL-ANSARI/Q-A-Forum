<p>Are you wanting to change the column name in the database table itself? If so, you'll need to execute a statement to MySQL itself. Changes to a DataGrid don't modify schema definitions.</p>

<p>Set up a MySQLConnection and MySQLCommand and .ExecuteNonQuery a line similar to:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE test CHANGE OldColumnName NewColumnName varchar(120);
</code></pre>

<p>Given your explanation of what you're doing, you should have OldColumnName and NewColumnName available. I imagine you know what the type is as well.</p>
