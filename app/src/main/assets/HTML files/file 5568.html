<p>If raw PHP code is output to the browser, it means the PHP wasn't processed on the server. It has nothing to do with the doctype, the server doesn't care about the doctype. There's a configuration problem on the server that causes it to serve .php files as-is, without pushing them through the PHP pre-processor. That, or you're accessing the file directly like <code>file:///path/to/file.php</code>, instead of requesting it through a web server.</p>
