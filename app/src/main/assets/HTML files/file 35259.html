<p>You can satisfy the requirememts of a <code>std::deque</code> with a <code>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;std::array&lt;T,N&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> roughly. plus a low/high water mark telling you where the first/last elements are. (for an implementation defined N that could vary with <code>T</code>, and the <code>std::array</code>s are actually blocks of properly aligned uninitialized memory and not <code>std::array</code>s, but you get the idea).</p>

<p>Use usual exponential growth, but on both front and back.</p>

<p>Lookup simply does <code>(index+first)/N</code> and <code>%N</code> to find the block and sub element.</p>

<p>This is more expensive than a <code>std::vector</code> lookup, but is O(1).</p>
