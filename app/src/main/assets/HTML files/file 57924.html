<p>I try to run your code and do not get this error. I comment out your system argument in your run.py and leave this code below.</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.secret_key = str(uuid.uuid4())
    port = '9000'
    app.run(debug=False, port=port, host='0.0.0.0')
</code></pre>

<p>Then I execute python run.py

<p>Then I request flask with 127.0.0.1:9000 and got this <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WlKyX.png" rel="nofollow">enter image description here</a></p>

<p>Flask works fine except a logging format error, and this error is out of topic.</p>

<p>Would you please post the command you executed and the directory you execute in? I think your working directory may lead this ImportError.</p>

<p>PS: The branch code your give in GitHub is different from the code post in this question. </p>
