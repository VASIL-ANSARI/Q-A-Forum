<p>Without knowing too much about your situation (like whether these are known conditions, or if the conditions are based on actions by the user), this is where I would start:</p>

<p>I would start with a ViewModel: </p>

<pre><code>public class ViewModel
{
    public bool ShowButton1 {get; set;}
    public bool ShowButton2 {get; set;}
    public bool ShowButton3 {get; set;}
    public bool ShowButton4 {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And put the logic for the conditions in your controllers:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Index()
{
    var viewModel = new ViewModel();
    viewModel.ShowButton1 = condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2;
    viewModel.ShowButton2 = condition3 &amp;&amp; condition4;
}
</code></pre>
