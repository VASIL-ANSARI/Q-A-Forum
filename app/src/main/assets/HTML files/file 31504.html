<p>search --> file
you can use a regex to search and there's a replace option.</p>

<p>as for a regexp that would capture your methods, you could try:</p>

<pre><code>Music2.playGeneric2\(context, R\.raw\.([^)]*)\)(.*)
</code></pre>

<p>that would set the 2nd argument (technically everything after the 1st argument up to the close-bracket as the 1st capture group, and the rest of the line as the 2nd capture group.</p>

<p>you could then replace with something like:</p>

<pre><code>Music2.playGeneric2(context, "$1")$2
</code></pre>

<p>to quote the 2nd argument</p>
