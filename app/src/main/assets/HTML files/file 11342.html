<p>what are you trying to accomplish here?  the get_field function is a per post in the loop method, so you would need to be iterating over the whole posts collection with the </p>

<pre><code>while ($loop-&gt;have_posts()) : $loop-&gt;the_post();
</code></pre>

<p>if you're not using a custom loop you would leave off the <code>$loop-&gt;</code> part.</p>

<p>you probably need to post the whole page template.  you might just need to do some studying on wordpress about the loop and how it works.</p>
