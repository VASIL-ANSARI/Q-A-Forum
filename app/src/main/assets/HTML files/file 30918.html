<p>This delegate method wouldn't be causing your problem. I'd look back to your subclass and check to see that you are not using any UITextField delegate methods that are expecting a YES response that you may have inadvertently changed the return responses for. It may be helpful to post you subclass so we can see what is going on in there too...</p>
