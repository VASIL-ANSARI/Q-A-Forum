<p>If the array is small you can just iterate over it and check.<br>
If it's significantly bigger, Your best method would be to pre-sort it and do a binary serach on it.</p>

<p>Another option can be to concatenate your array to a single string and then just check for an existance in this string (either with <code>indexOf</code> or with regex)</p>
