<p>It's not very clear what you are trying to do. In the first snippet you repeatedly set the same variable, <code>votingEntry</code>, to a string containing an ID from a list. Since you set the same variable each time, the var will end up with only the last value from the list.</p>

<p>Additionally, in order to set a global variable <em>outside</em> a function in JS, you need the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

<p>However, I'm not quite sure why you are doing any of this, because you're then not using the <code>votingEntry</code> variable anywhere else in your JS. You need to provide more detail about what you are hoping to achieve.</p>
