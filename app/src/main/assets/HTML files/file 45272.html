<p>After trying it on a windows XP.. it turns out that is is not the Google Maps, I mean I can add marker statically. In stead, I realized that it is actually the problem of the CORS on IE 8 + 9.</p>

<p>As you can see in the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=cors" rel="nofollow">caniuse.com</a>, IE 8 and IE 9 has only a partial support on CORS. Also it is said in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest#cite_ref-32" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internet Explorer did not implement CORS until version 10. The two previous versions (8 and 9) offered similar functionality through the XDomainRequest API. It is now supported by all modern browsers (desktop and mobile)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are discussions saying that using <code>jQuery.support.cors = true;</code> would make it works, but sadly no luck for my Windows XP + IE 8.</p>
