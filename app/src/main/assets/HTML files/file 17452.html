  <p>So I know how to reference variables from different classes, but I'm wondering if it's worth me creating a Vars.class to house all my global vars.</p>

<p>No. It's worth trying to avoid having global variables in the first place. Variables should represent the state of a particular object - so group variables according to sensible boundaries for useful objects, and then make sure that each object knows about whatever other objects it needs to depend on.</p>

<p>There's little point in using an object-oriented language if you're going to throw away object orientation.</p>

<p>Taking the time to work out the appropriate types in your application will no doubt be slower in the <em>very</em> short term than just having global variables... but it'll make your code <em>much</em> easier to maintain and test.</p>

<p>As for performance: you're worrying about that <em>much</em> too early. Access time for variables will almost <em>never</em> be a significant performance impact. Design your code in the simplest way that works. Decide on a performance metric and acceptance criteria. See whether your code already meets those criteria. If it doesn't, work out why it doesn't and perform the cleanest change you can to improve performance (measuring all the time).</p>

<p>Additionally, the variables themselves should almost always be private: storage is an <em>implementation</em> decision; consider how and whether to expose the state through <em>methods</em>.</p>
