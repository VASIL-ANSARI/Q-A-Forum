<p>Libpcap is just used for packet capturing, i.e. making packets available for use in other programs. It does not perform any network setup, like blocking, opening ports. In this sense pcap is a purely passive monitoring tool.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you want to do. As far as I see it, there are two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You actually want to block the packets, so that your computer will not process them in any way. You should use a firewall for that and just block this port. Any decent firewall should be able to do that fairly easy. But you should be aware, that this also means no one will be able to ssh into your system. So if you do that on a remote system, you have effectively locked out yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>You still want other programs (sshd) to listen on port 23 but all this traffic is annoying you in your application. Libpcap has a filtering function for that, that is quite powerful. With this function you can pass small scripts to libpcap and have it only report packets that fit. Look up filtering in the pcap documentation for more information. This will however not "block the traffic" just stop pcap from capturing it.</p></li>
</ol>
