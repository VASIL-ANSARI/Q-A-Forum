<p>PHP will not populate <code>$_POST</code> with data from fields with names of the form <code>[something]</code>. You need to change the name.</p>

<p>If you want <code>$_POST['1a']['often']</code> to have a value then you need <code>name="1a[often]"</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming the value of <code>me.id</code> is <code>1a</code>, you are currently setting it to <code>name="['1a']['often']"</code></p>

<pre><code>this.often.name = "['"+me.id+"']['often']";
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>this.often.name = me.id + "[often]";
</code></pre>
