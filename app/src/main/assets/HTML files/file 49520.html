<p>I have a few suggestions to make this easier for you.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should create a class to capture you song information rather than having two separate arrays. This will make life much easier for you in the long term (and is better OO practice). You can then create a <code>toString</code> method as part of that class to format song information:</p>

<pre><code>class Song {
    private final String title;
    private final int length;

    public String toString() {
        return title + ":" + length;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your song arrays then become simpler:</p>

<pre><code>private Song[] songs = new Song[MAX_SONGS];
</code></pre>

<p>Printing the entire list can be done in a number of ways. Before Java 8 it would generally look something like:</p>

<pre><code>for (Song song: songs)
    System.out.println(song);
</code></pre>

<p>Since Java 8 was released this can be simplified to:</p>

<pre><code>Arrays.stream(songs).forEach(System.out::println);
</code></pre>

<p>Removing items from an array is not as easy as removing them from a collection. But it's still not too hard:</p>

<pre><code>Song[] copy = new Song[MAX_SONGS];
int copiedSongs = 0;
for (Song song: songs)
    if (/* condition for copying */)
        copy[copiedSongs++] = song;
songs = copy;
numSongs = copiedSongs;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, using Java 8 this has become much simpler:</p>

<pre><code>songs = Arrays.stream(songs).filter(/*condition*/).toArray();
numSongs = songs.length;
</code></pre>
