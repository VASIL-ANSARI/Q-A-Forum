<p>The backspace character is not a valid XML character and needs to be escaped (<code>&amp;#08;</code>). I'm surprised MySQL is not doing that here, but I'm not familiar with MySQL. You can also check your data and clean it up with an update statement to get rid of that character if it is not valid data for the table.</p>

<p>As far as parsing it out in python, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>lines.replace("\b", "&amp;#08;")
</code></pre>
