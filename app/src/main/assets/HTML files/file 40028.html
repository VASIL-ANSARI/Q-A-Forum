<p>This is probably similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15216711/an-error-occurred-during-client-rendering">this question</a> which gave the same error except it was a parameter called index that failed on HTML rendering but worked for every other renderer.</p>

<p>What happened in that instance was that I upgraded an SSRS 2005 report to SSRS 2008 and something got misaligned in the conversion. SSRS now thinks that you have a text box or something with a negative length. When it talks about a parameter called length, it doesn't mean one of your report parameters but a parameter that is part of the XML that is used internally to size your report objects. Your report probably looks fine but something has gone wrong in the code. </p>

<p>It is a process of re-positioning and re-sizing report objects until you find the one that is causing the error.</p>
