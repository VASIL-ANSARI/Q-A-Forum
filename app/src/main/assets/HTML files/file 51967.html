<p>Sounds like an excellent candidate for cookies if you are allowed to use them: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp</a>.  Another idea is to pass it along in a Query String.  It isn't PII or anything like that.  Try an event code on that input.  I do not like to hit "enter"!</p>

<pre><code>onkeypress="if (event.keycode==13) { // do something }"
</code></pre>
