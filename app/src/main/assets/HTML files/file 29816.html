<p>It's done only because of avoiding using global variables. Of course you can skip defining jQuery and underscore but <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> will refer to the global variables in this case. In case you create your own application and use single version of jQuery - it will not case issues, but if your application already includes few different library versions - it's better to follow practice you do not like to follow :)</p>
