<blockquote>
  <p>I need the ORDER BY to take place after row was given.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM
(
   SELECT (@row:=@row+1) AS ROW, ID , ColA, ColB, ColC
    FROM TableA 
    JOIN TableB on TableB.ID = TableA.ID
    JOIN TableC on TableC.ID = TableA.ID 
    ,(SELECT @row := 0) r 
) t
ORDER BY ROW ASC
</code></pre>
