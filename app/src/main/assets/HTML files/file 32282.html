<p>Each call to <code>fgets</code> returns a new line until EOF (i.e. "end of file").</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets" rel="nofollow"><code>fgets</code></a></p>

<p>For a bare outline example of a read loop using <code>fgets</code>, see:</p>

<p>However, if you can't be sure of allocating a buffer long enough to hold a line, it is often better to use <code>fgetc</code> to read each character one at a time -- not to worry, the file I/O is still buffered, not read a character at a time -- and assemble the text into tokens as you go along rather than dealing with lines longer than whatever buffer you provide which may then require you to handle tokens split between one filled buffer and the next.</p>
