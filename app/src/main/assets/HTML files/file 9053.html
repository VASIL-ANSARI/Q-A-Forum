<p>I don't believe there is an <em>out of the box</em> way to configure Autofac to ignore <code>Obsolete</code> constructors.  However, Autofac is so good, there is always a way to get it done :)  Here are two options:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1.  Tell Autofac which Constructor to use</strong></p>

<p>Do this using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac/wiki/Autowiring#Choosing_Constructors"><code>UsingConstructor</code> registration extension</a> method.</p>



<pre class="lang-csh prettyprint-override"><code>builder.RegisterType&lt;Example&gt;().UsingConstructor(typeof(MyService));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 2.  Provide a custom <code>IConstructorFinder</code> to <code>FindConstructorsWith</code></strong></p>

<p>Autofac has a registration extension method called <code>FindConstructorsWith</code>.  You can pass a custom <code>IConstructorFinder</code> to one of the two overloads.  You could write a simple <code>IConstructorFinder</code> called <code>NonObsoleteConstructorFinder</code> that will only return constructors <em>without</em> the Obsolete attribute.</p>

<p>I have written this class and added a working version of your sample.  You can <a href="https://github.com/bentayloruk/AutofacAnswers/blob/master/AutofacAnswers/SoAnswer6407530.cs">view the full code</a> and use it as inspiration.  <em>IMO option this is the more elegant option.</em>  I have added it to my <a href="https://github.com/bentayloruk/AutofacAnswers">AutofacAnswers</a> project on GitHub.  </p>

<p><em>Note:  The other overload takes BindingFlags.  I don't think you can specify attribute requirements using <code>BindingFlags</code>.  However, you may want to check that.</em></p>
