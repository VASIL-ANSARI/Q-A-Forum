<p>Did you synthesize it in your implementation?</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize score;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you do not want a pointer to an int, but an int itself. Remove the '*'.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I'm assuming <code>score.text</code> is setting the text for a <code>UILabel</code> or similar? And is different from Game's <code>score</code>.</p>

<p>Another check you can use is to make use of dot-notation. If the property is not properly set, you will get an error rather than a warning. I.e. <code>game.score</code> instead of <code>[game score]</code>.</p>
