<p>So you want to take the text from a doc file, and append it to the end of the text in another doc file. And the problem here is that's MS Word files. It's a proprietary format, and as far as I know there is not module to access them from Python.</p>

<p>But if you are on Windows, you can access them via the COM API, but that's pretty complicated. But look into that. Otehrwise I recommend you to not us MS Word files. The above sounds like some sort of logging facility, and it sounds like a bad idea to use Word files for this, it's too fragile.</p>
