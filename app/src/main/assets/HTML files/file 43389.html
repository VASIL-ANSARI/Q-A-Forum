<p>Try replacing the vertical size of the textctrl with -1, so wx will use the default best size for the height of the widget.  If I remember correctly the normal height of single line textctrls on Windows is about 23 pixels, so using 20 will not give it enough room to draw itself the way it wants to.</p>
