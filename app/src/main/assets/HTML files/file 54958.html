<p>Might be a little bit late for a reply, but as I understand, you have MySQL and PHP running on the web-server which "hosts" your Form.</p>

<p>There are several options available to you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you really insist on using OneDrive for your "synchronization" purposes, then OneDrive actually offers <a href="https://dev.onedrive.com/README.htm" rel="nofollow">API</a>. When processing your Form inputs, after you have sent the query to MySQL for CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE, you could each time create the database dump and import it into a new Excel file - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15699301/export-mysql-data-to-excel-in-php">Export MySQL data to Excel in PHP</a>. Subsequently you can use OneDrive API to upload the file to OneDrive.</p></li>
<li><p>There is such a thing as <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/excel/1.3.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL for Excel</a>. I have not personally tried it, but it seems to be just the tool you are looking for!</p></li>
<li><p>Personally, I would use a web-based approach to Database management. PHPMyAdmin does offer direct MySQL management, but it's not usable in day-to-day business management. I would recommend using an MVC Framework such as <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" rel="nofollow">Yii</a> along with Grid View extensions such as <a href="http://demos.krajee.com/grid-demo" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which has "Export to Excel" feature from the box.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
