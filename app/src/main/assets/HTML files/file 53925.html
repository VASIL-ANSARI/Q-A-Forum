<p>I have always preferred to store <em>items</em> on the <strong>filesystem</strong> and store the <em>paths</em> in the <strong>database</strong>.</p>

<p>I think the only advantage to putting it in a <strong>BLOB</strong> is that you can move the database around and not have to worry about distributing files. For normal websites this wouldn't really matter but for some kind of product like a CMS or website addon it would be a handy way to include a resource file with the distribution...</p>

<p>The reason I prefer the <strong>filesystem</strong> is because that is what the <strong>filesystem</strong> is designed for - serving files. I don't see any valid reason to put all that stress into a bottleneck by pushing all the data through the database.</p>

<p>On the other hand the only time I reccomend storing files as a <strong>BLOB</strong> in SQL is when the images or files contain sensitive data (i.e. Medical Images, etc.) where you need the security that SQL Server provides.  Otherwise storing and reading the file from a <strong>filesystem</strong> is much faster; you can keep a reference to the file's location in SQL Server for the best method. </p>
