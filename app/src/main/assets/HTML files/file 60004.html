<p>The problem is that you're storing <code>i</code> into <code>a[i]</code>. When <code>a</code> is a <code>char</code> array, the maximum value of an element is <code>127</code> (if <code>char</code> defaults to <code>signed</code>) or <code>255</code> (if it's <code>unsigned</code>), assuming a typical system with 8-bit bytes. If it's signed, overflow results in implementation-defined behavior; if it's unsigned, overflow wraps around modulo <code>256</code>.</p>

<p>The only thing you care about is whether the value of the element is zero or non-zero, so there's no need to put different values in them. Just initialize them all to <code>1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 2; i &lt; N; i++) a[i] = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This will also work when you change it to boolean.</p>
