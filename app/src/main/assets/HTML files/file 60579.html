<p>It looks like an error I'd expect to see if I were using code compiled in a different version of Scala.  Have you tried running it with <code>--packages org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.10:1.1.0</code>?</p>

<p>By default in Spark 1.6.x is compiled against Scala 2.10 and you have to manually build it for Scala 2.11 like so:</p>

<pre><code>./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.11
mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.4 -Dscala-2.11 -DskipTests clean package
</code></pre>
