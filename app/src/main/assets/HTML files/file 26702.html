<p>Passing an object through a <code>void*</code> and release it in a callback method is something the analyzer cannot understand. You could just silence the analyzer for these cases.</p>

<p>But in this case the code is broken anyway and should be refactored. You cannot use KVO's context to pass an object to the callback: You need the context to identify the observation. See for example <a href="http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2008/09/24/proper_kvo_usage/" rel="nofollow">Dave Dribin's description of how to do KVO properly</a>.</p>

<p>Can't you just set the block as a completion block to the operation you add?</p>
