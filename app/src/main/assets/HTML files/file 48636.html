<p>you can make the parameter of camera, and then apply colorfilter to the parameter to get the different effect, but first you have to check the supported colorfilter for your device, basically it is device dependent.</p>

<pre><code>Camera.Parameters p = camera.getParameters();

            camera.Parameters parameters = camera.getParameters(); //this will provide the supporting parameter for your device.
             p.setSceneMode(Camera.Parameters.FLASH_MODE_AUTO);  //it will set the flash mode.
             p.setColorEffect(Camera.Parameters.EFFECT_NEGATIVE);  //it will set the color effect to the preview and recording videos.


            camera.setParameters(p);
</code></pre>

<p>but be careful with nexus device , i had checked this method into nexus 5, the camera preview was showing with effect, but recording was done as normal.</p>

<p>check it out, hope it will help. </p>
