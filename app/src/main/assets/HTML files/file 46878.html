<p>What you seek is often called a <em>join table</em>. This is how SQL represents many-to-many relationships between two entities. The purest of pure join tables  joining tables A and B consists of two columns, one containing A_id, and the other B_id. The two columns together constitute the primary key of the join table.</p>

<p>In your case you'll have three columns in the join table:</p>

<pre><code> Meal_id        pk, fk to Meal table
 Ingredient_id  pk, fk to Ingredient table
 Amount         something giving the amount
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the ingredients for a particular meal, you use a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT m.Mealname, i.IngredientName, mi.Amount
  FROM Meal AS m
  JOIN MealIngredient AS mi ON m.Meal_id = mi.Meal_id
  JOIN Ingredient AS i ON mi.Ingredient_id = i.Ingredient_id
</code></pre>
