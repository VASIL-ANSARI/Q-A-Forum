<p>Alright, tried a new upgrade again from 3.6 to Firefox 6, same error. @Nickolay was right, it has something to do with the proxy configuration, but, i didn't touch it!</p>

<p>To get rid from this message go to menu:
Extra|Options|Advanced|Network Tab and open connection settings.
Set Proxy to "No Proxy"</p>

<p>Error is gone. </p>
