<p>If you're on a non-Debian based Linux and using glibc then you have to be aware that glibc caches resolv.conf and won't look at it again unless explicitly told to. Essentially it is up to your application to tell glibc if resolv.conf has changed and needs to be reloaded by calling <code>__res_init</code>.
