<p>Yes it is a duplicate of your last question. You were shown 3 working examples that used a null layout and dynamically changed the location of the image.</p>

<p>If you delete the line:</p>

<pre><code>JButton left = addMotionSupport( component );
</code></pre>

<p>from either of the first two examples, then you have exactly what you want, a frame with a panel using a null layout with a label at location (100, 100).</p>

<p>In those examples, only the panel that contained the layout used a null layout. Then the code used the setSize() and setLocation() methods on the label.</p>

<p>In your code here you set a null layout to the panel containing the label, but you also set the frame to use a null layout, which is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Not only that after you set the size and location you override those values by using the setBounds() method and the width/height of the frame will be (0, 0) so the size of the label will be (0, 0) so there is nothing to paint. </p>

<p>Again, this was NOT done in the 3 examples. Follow the code from the examples. The code from the examples also creates the GUI components on the EDT, which is how all GUIS should be created.</p>
