<p>If you change you signal to a proper class then it works fine for me. eg :</p>

<pre><code>result_ready = QtCore.Signal(str)
</code></pre>

<p>This works in both cases.</p>

<p>According to docs </p>

<p>Signals can be defined using the QtCore.Signal() class. Python types and C types can be passed as parameters to it. If you need to overload it just pass the types as tuples or lists.</p>
