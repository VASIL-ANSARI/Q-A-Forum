<p>Nope, there aren't. Your options are as you suggest. Personally, I would probably go with the idea of hijacking an iterator pair from a static empty vector; I can't imagine what notional "overhead" would be involved here, beyond a couple of extra bytes in your process image.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/17198239/560648">Is this a singular iterator and, if so, can I compare it to another one?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1190112/560648">Comparing default-constructed iterators with operator==</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And this hasn't changed in either C++14 or C++17 (so far).</p>
