<p>Short answer: It doesn't.</p>

<p>Long answer: If your content is only accessable via javascript calls, and with no fallbacks, Google is not indexing it. Without seeing the page, I would presume that the link normally links to something along the lines of <code>http://example.com/questions.php?page=2</code>, which is processed by the back end. You could then override the link with some JQuery:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="/questions.php?page=2" class='nextPage'&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    $('a.nextPage').click(function(){
        e.preventDefault();
        $.ajax(/*etc*/)
    })
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is just yet another in a long list of reasons to always degrade gracefully.</p>
