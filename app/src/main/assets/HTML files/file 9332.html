<p>I <em>guess</em> the behavior is device-specific. When testing the demo at <a href="http://www.thedotproduct.org/experiments/geo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedotproduct.org/experiments/geo/</a> on my <em>HTC Desire</em> I get prompted only once unless I reload the page.</p>

<p>Of course the user won't be prompted again anyway if he chooses to permanently allow the page to access the users location (which I did <em>not</em> for the demo above).</p>
