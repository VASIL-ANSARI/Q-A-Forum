<p>Because the size of the "string" pointer is 8 bytes. Here are some examples of using sizeof() with their appropriate "size". The term size_of() is sometimes deceiving for people not used to using it. In your case, the size of the pointer is 8 bytes.. below is a representation on a typical 32-bit system.</p>

<pre><code>sizeof (char)   = 1
sizeof (double) = 8
sizeof (float)  = 4
sizeof (int)    = 4
sizeof (long)   = 4
sizeof (long long)  = 8
sizeof (short)  = 2
sizeof (void *) = 4

sizeof (clock_t)    = 4
sizeof (pid_t)  = 4
sizeof (size_t) = 4
sizeof (ssize_t)    = 4
sizeof (time_t) = 4
</code></pre>

<p>You are leaving out how you are determining your string is disappearing (char array). It is probably being passed to a function, which you need to pass the explicit length as a variable or track it somewhere. Using sizeof() won't tell you this.</p>

<p>See my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2051462/question-about-why-string-is-truncated-on-first-instance-of-0">previous question</a> about this and you'll see even my lack of initial understanding.</p>
