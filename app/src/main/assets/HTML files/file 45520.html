Basically - getCell() returns a Range object.. you need to add the .getValue() method to get the value of the cell in the range which you are trying to do in the script. I found that using getRange with the cell address works much better: i.e. <strong>getRange ('B1').</strong></p>

<li>getCell is not designed to return the value of your cell but rather to return a Range object of a cell, as discussed here: </li>

<p>The cell object is a formula so you really don't want that. Hence using getRange meaning the you get the range of the result of the formula in the one cell.</p>

<p>That sounds like I know more than I do. I stumbled across this problem myself and fixed it as indicated above.</p>
