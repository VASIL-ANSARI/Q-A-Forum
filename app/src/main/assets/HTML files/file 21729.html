</ul>

<p>The most relevant portion:</p>

<pre><code>Do throw the most specific (the most derived) exception that is appropriate. 
For example, if a method receives a null (Nothing in Visual Basic) argument, 
it should throw System.ArgumentNullException instead of its base type 
System.ArgumentException.
</code></pre>

<p>I would extrapolate that to also mean in your case, the most detailed exception is the "correct" one to propogate; making a few assumptions about your exception types, they are probably the "correct" one to propogate, <em>possibly</em> wrapped in a "ConnectionException" custom exception.</p>

<p>That said, I do see how it would "make sense" to consider wrapping it in an <code>IOException</code>, since that is the "shape" of the exception; but in cases where I disagree with the guidelines and I go my way, it usually bites me later down the road. :)</p>
