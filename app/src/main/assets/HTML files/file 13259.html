<p>The namespace is a part of the complete name of the class. So if you wouldn't add the namespace to the classname in @param you would give a wrong type.</p>

<p>Personally I think namespaces will become very soon the main criteria for the organization of classes in PHP. So the documentation tools will all have to use them.  </p>
