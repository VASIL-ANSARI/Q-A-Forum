<p>You need to look at the <strong>Mediator Pattern</strong>. Its a singleton type object that you load up with references to root components. The mediadator then mediates calls to other distant GUI components.</p>

<p>You could also pass the highest component (ie. the frame) through the constructors of all panels. Then when you have a reference to the frame you can build in methods which access the other panels and components.</p>
