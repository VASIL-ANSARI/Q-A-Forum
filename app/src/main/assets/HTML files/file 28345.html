<p>Try <code>scanf("%d", &amp;phoneNumber);</code> and use <code>%d</code> for the <code>printf</code> as well.  In C and its derivatives, functions are all pass-by-value.  In order for a function to modify a variable, you need to pass in the address of that variable rather than its value.  That's why you prefix with <code>&amp;</code> to get the address of <code>phoneNumber</code> into the <code>scanf</code> function.  However, you only use the <code>&amp;</code> for the <code>scanf</code> argument, not for declaring or using the variable locally.</p>
