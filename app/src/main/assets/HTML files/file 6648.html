<p>You could declare it public by using the <code>x:FieldModifier</code> attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ContentControl Name="myControl" x:FieldModifier="Public"&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>However, I wouldn't recommend doing that... instead, you should expose the content itself, not the <code>ContentControl</code>. You can expose it through a public property, or pass it as a constructor parameter to other windows</p>
