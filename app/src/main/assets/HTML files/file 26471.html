<p>The Answer from the comments is still applicable. </p>

<p>You just need to turn your m:n relation to a m:1 plus 1:n relation that you will end up with 3 Entities instead of 2. And as soon as you have 3 Entities you can also just create a new form for the "intermediate" entity, because it is like every other entity. </p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>

<p>You can still simulate the same thing if you add some logic to your client:</p>

<pre><code>public function addService(Service $service){
     $clientService = new ClientService();
     $clientService-&gt;setClient($this);
     $clientService-&gt;setService($service);
     $this-&gt;clientService-&gt;add($clientService);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can do some similar simulations with getService();</p>

<p>Alternative is that you only need to adopt your Form and have multiple clientservicio on your client form but then on each clientservicio form only one service. This should still work.</p>
