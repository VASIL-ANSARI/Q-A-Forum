<p>Look at <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">System.Data.SQLite</a> which can be embedded into your program. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>System.Data.SQLite</strong> is the original
  SQLite database engine and a complete
  ADO.NET 2.0/3.5 provider all rolled
  into a single mixed mode assembly.  It
  is a complete drop-in replacement for
  the original sqlite3.dll (you can even
  rename it to sqlite3.dll if you're
  using it natively).</p>
