<p>The easiest way to handle this would be to use jQuery toggle. This allows you to activate two functions on alternate clicks.</p>

<pre><code>$('a.contact').toggle(
function(){
    // odd clicks
},
function(){
    // even clicks
});
</code></pre>

<p>...And a quick <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/bVr2r/">jsFiddle to demonstrate</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this uses <a href="http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/">jQuery's toggle event handler</a>, not the animation effect of the same name.</p>

<p>Note #2: As per the documentation, toggle() was removed in jQuery 1.9. (That is, the method signature that allowed you to pass multiple functions which were activated on alternate clicks.)</p>
