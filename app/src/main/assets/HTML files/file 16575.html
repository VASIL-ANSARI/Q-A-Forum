<p>it is not possible, to extend token endlessly. See Scenario 4 here <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/">https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using the new endpoint below, you will be able to extend the
  expiration time of an existing, non-expired, short-lived user
  access_token. Please note, the <strong>endpoint can only be used to extend
  the short-lived user access_tokens</strong>. If you pass an access_token that
  had a long-lived expiration time, the endpoint will simply pass that
  same access_token back to you without altering or extending the
  expiration time.</p>
  
  <p>To get the long-lived user access_token simply pass your own client_id
  (your app_id), your app_secret, and the non-expired, short-lived
  access_token to the endpoint below. You will be returned a new
  long-lived user access_token; this access_token will exist in addition
  to the short-lived access_token that was passed into the endpoint.
  <strong>If you would like to refresh a still valid long-lived access_token, you will have to get a new short-lived user access_token first</strong> and
  then call the same endpoint below. The returned access_token will have
  a fresh long-lived expiration time, however, the access_token itself
  may or may not be the same as the previously granted long-lived
  access_token.</p>
