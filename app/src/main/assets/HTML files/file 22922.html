<p>As you rightly say, the device has not been rotated, so the revealed view controller does not insist on rotating the orientation when the old view controller is popped. If that's the behavior you want, use a presented view controller instead.</p>

<p>You can force interface rotation by rotating the status bar, but only if <code>supportedInterfaceOrientations</code> returns 0.</p>
