<pre><code>$('li').each(function () {

  if (! $(this).hasClass('disabled'))
  {
    // code for non-disabled li goes here
  }

});
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is basically what you're asking for.  Not sure what you mean by "return the index" - do you just want an array of indexes for all the items that are without the "disabled" class?</p>
