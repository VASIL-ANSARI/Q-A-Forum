<p>The problem is that evaluating <code>task.Result</code> will block until the query has completed.</p>

<p>The simplest option is probably to make the <code>Search</code> method perform the <code>_dispatcher.BeginInvoke</code> call at the end instead.</p>

<p>Another option - which will become easier with C# 5 - would be to add a continuation to the task, so that when it's completed you can update the UI. At the moment you'd use <code>Task.ContinueWith</code>; with C# 5 you'd use <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.</p>
