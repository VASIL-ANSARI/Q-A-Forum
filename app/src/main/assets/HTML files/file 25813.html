<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible with the app engine cron implementation. The app engine <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/cron#The_Schedule_Format" rel="nofollow">cron format</a> is a bit confusing, because it is actually two formats. One format supports specifying frequencies and time ranges (i.e., <code>every 10 minutes from 07:00 to 23:00</code>), and another supports specifying only a specific time, but on varying days (i.e., <code>every mon,tue,wed,thu,fri 07:00</code>).</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> write out a giant cron file with each specific time you want, but that is silly. Instead, you should just use a <code>every 10 minutes from 08:00 to 16:00</code> job, and do checking on the server to make sure it's within the day and time range (for the weekends) that you require.</p>
