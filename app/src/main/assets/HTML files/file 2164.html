<p>If you are referring to TODOs that are defined with the <strong>// TODO</strong> comments.<br>
Open the Task List and set it to the Comments filter.</p>

<p>Also be careful with GhostDoc. Always read the comment that was generated, I remember that older versions would generate comment like: "Toes the string" for a method like ToString().</p>
