<p>When you create your native app, you are going to want to access your business logic and database via an API that you create. So when you are developing your website, you really want to think in terms of a MVC (model-view-controller) architecture. Ideally, both your website and mobile app will share the same model and controllers, and you will simply implement the views (very) differently in each. </p>

<p>For example, when you do a login on the website or in the app, you want it to call the exact same code base on the server (and pass the exact same parameters) to process the login. Therefore, make sure to decouple your business methods (controller logic) from your presentation layer when you design the site and always think in terms of "should this functionality be exposed in my API or is it website only presentation". </p>

<p>If you do this now, it will save you a lot of pain later. </p>
