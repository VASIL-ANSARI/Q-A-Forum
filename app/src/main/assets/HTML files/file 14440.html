<ol>
<li><p>Make a new file in app/views/users called _login.coffee with only the fields you want. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>formFor @user, (f) -&gt;
  f.fieldset (fields) -&gt;
    fields.field "email", as: "string"
    fields.field "password", as: "string"
  f.fieldset (fields) -&gt;
    fields.submit "Submit"
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Edit the file app/views/users/new.coffee so that the line which did read <code>partial "form"</code> now reads <code>partial "login"</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now your view should correctly render. Of course, your now storing a password as plaintext, etc, but that's a whole other story...</p>
