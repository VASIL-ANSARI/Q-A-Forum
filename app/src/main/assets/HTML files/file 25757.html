<p>You need to add a MouseMotionListener for dragging to work. You're just adding a MouseListener.</p>

<p>i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>public void start() {
  MouseEventListener myMouseEventListener = new MouseEventListener(this);
  addMouseListener(myMouseEventListener);
  addMouseMotionListener(myMouseEventListener);

  //this.addMouseListener(new MouseEventListener(this));
</code></pre>

<p>Also as per my comments, your getX() and getY() methods of the Square class override the same methods of JLabel, and that if you aren't careful with these and use them correctly they can totally mess up the placement of your components in the GUI. Myself, I take great pains to avoid overriding these very methods. Consider changing their names if overriding wasn't your intention.</p>

<p>Also, I tend to favor <code>mousePressed(...)</code> over the <code>mouseClicked(...)</code> method as the former will respond to the press even if you move the mouse after pressing it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: another bug!  You should almost never get your Graphics instance by calling <code>getGraphics()</code> on a component as the Graphics object returned is evanescent and may soon become null. Instead either draw on a BufferedImage which is displayed in a JComponent or JPanel's <code>paintComponent(...)</code> or just draw in <code>paintComponent(...)</code> itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 2: why override <code>paint(...)</code>? That seems a bit dangerous to me, especially since you're not calling the super method, and especially since there is no need to do this sort of thing.</p>
