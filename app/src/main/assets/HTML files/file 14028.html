<p>Let's suppose you have two tables finance_grdps_exp and finance_grdps_inc of following structure:</p>

<pre>date_on | amount</pre>

<ol>
<li><p>If there are no two rows with same year and month encoded in date_on in one table, date_on contains only year and month i.e. other fields (day and time) are same for all rows.</p>

<p>You can combine them with INNER JOIN construction:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT finance_grdps_exp.date_on AS date_on,
       finance_grdps_exp.amount AS exp_amount,
       finance_grdps_inc.amount AS inc_amount
FROM finance_grdps_exp INNER JOIN finance_grdps_inc
ON finance_grdps_exp.date_on = finance_grdps_inc.date_on
</code></pre>

<p>Resulting structure is:</p>

<pre>date_on | exp_amount | inc_amount</pre>

<p>Then let's apply your idea to resulting structure:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT date_on,
       MONTHNAME(FROM_UNIXTIME(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.date_on)) as expmonth,
       YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.date_on)) as expyear,
       SUM(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.exp_amount) as exp_total,
       SUM(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.inc_amount) as inc_total

FROM (SELECT finance_grdps_exp.date_on AS date_on,
             finance_grdps_exp.amount AS exp_amount,
             finance_grdps_inc.amount AS inc_amount
FROM finance_grdps_exp INNER JOIN finance_grdps_inc
ON finance_grdps_exp.date_on = finance_grdps_inc.date_on) AS finance_grdps_exp_and_inc

GROUP BY expyear, expmonth ORDER BY date_on DESC
</code></pre>

<p>mysql_query gives us:</p>

<pre><code>    [
      expmonth,
      expyear,
      exp_total /* expense per month */,
      inc_total /* income per month */
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>To be sure in maximum performance of INNER JOIN statement 
create index for date_on fields in both tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Other case (using UNION SELECT).</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MONTHNAME(FROM_UNIXTIME(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.date_on)) as expmonth,
       YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.date_on)) as expyear,
       SUM(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.exp_amount) as exp_total,
       SUM(finance_grdps_exp_and_inc.inc_amount) as inc_total
FROM(SELECT finance_grdps_exp.date_on AS date_on,
       finance_grdps_exp.amount AS exp_amount,
       0 AS inc_amount 
       FROM finance_grdps_exp
     UNION 
     SELECT finance_grdps_inc.date_on AS date_on,
       0 AS exp_amount,
       finance_grdps_inc.amount AS inc_amount
       finance_grdps_inc) AS finance_grdps_exp_and_inc
GROUP BY expyear, expmonth ORDER BY date_on DESC
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
