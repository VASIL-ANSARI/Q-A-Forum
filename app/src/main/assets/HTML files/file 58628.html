<p>The problem is, that you're trying to modify the UI in a thread other than the thread, the UI was created from. 
Have a look at the SynchronizationContext class (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.synchronizationcontext(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.synchronizationcontext(v=vs.110).aspx</a>) and try the following:
Before you invoke a new thread assign 
    SynchronizationContext.Current
 to a variable. Then start the new thread and if you want to update the UI do that by calling 
    myContext.Post(cb => { doSomethingOnUi(); }, null) 
and see if that fixes your problem.</p>
