<p>What does "something else" mean ? You need to have an id of an element in your page, where the content from the ajax response will be rendered.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="myID"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>somewhere in the page, and change 'mainPage' in //ATTENTION1 to 'myID', then the response from the ajax request will be placed in that div.</p>

<p>The change you make in //ATTENTION2 is for intermediary states because it is on "else", so will not impact what happens when the ajax request is complete.</p>
