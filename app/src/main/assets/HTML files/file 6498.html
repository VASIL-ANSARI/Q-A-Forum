<p>Yes you are right. The behaviour is undefined in C++03 because you are trying to modify <code>i</code> more than once between two sequence points.</p>

<p>The behaviour is well defined in C++0x because <code>(++i)++</code> is equivalent to <code>(i += 1)++</code>. The side effects of the <code>+=</code> operator are sequenced relative to <code>++</code> (post increment) and so the behaviour is well defined.</p>
