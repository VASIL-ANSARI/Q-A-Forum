<p>I think your goal of doing this without a converter is good, but your goal of doing it entirely declaratively is questionable.  I'd add an <code>IsChecked</code> property to the view model of the <code>ComboBox</code>'s items and bind to it.  Putting the decision-making process that underlies the setting of that property into the view seems, to me, to be muddying up the separation of concerns.</p>
