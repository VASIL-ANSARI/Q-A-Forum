<p>When you use aggregation funcion you can filter with a proper operator named HAVING </p>

<p>Having worok on the result of the query (then pn the aggrgated result like count() ) instead of where that work on  the original value of the tables rows</p>

<pre><code>SELECT author.name, COUNT(name) 
FROM author INNER JOIN author_has_publication 
        ON author.idAuthor=author_has_publication.Author_idAuthor 
INNER JOIN publication 
       ON author_has_publication.Publication_idPublication=publication.idPublication 
AND publication.date=2010 AND publication.conference='DPC'
GROUP BY author.name 
HAVING COUNT(name)&gt;=2;
</code></pre>
