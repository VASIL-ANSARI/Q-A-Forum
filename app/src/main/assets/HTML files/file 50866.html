<ul>
<li><p>You can convert your lists to <code>tuple</code>s, and then a pair of tuples can be used as a dictionary key. </p></li>
<li><p>You may also try to move this pair of string lists into a separate object of some class (give it a name suitable for your field) and use it as key, but be careful not to spawn new object with the same lists.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>class Key:
    def __init__(self, lst1, lst2):
        self.lst1 = lst1
        self.lst2 = lst2

k = Key([], [])
d = {k: 1}  # d[k] would be fine, but d[Key([], [])] will raise KeyError
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The first approach has a downside - you won't be able to perform list manipulations in-place, since they will be <code>tuple</code>s. But while the lists are small enough, performance downgrade is negligible.</p>
