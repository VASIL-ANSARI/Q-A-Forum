<p>You could do it like this (just pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>fopen();
offset = loadOffset();
fseek(offset); // set offset from previous run
while(!feof())
{
  fgets();
  if(searchKeyword() == true)
  {
    offset = ftell(); // getting the offset (after the line you just read)
    doSomething();

  }
}
saveOffset(offset);
fclose();
</code></pre>

<p>Hint: Be carefull with feof(); it returns true only if a input operation failed because of EOF. If the file pointer is at EOF but nothing failed before, it returns false. You have to handle that case.</p>
