<p>You are explicitly requesting a GPS-only location provider in your code. This forces Android to rely on GPS alone, with all of its drawbacks (GPS requires a clean view of the sky to work, for example).</p>

<p>To get a more reliable device tracking, you have to use a more reliable and flexible location strategy, changing the current location provider accordingly to the changed external scenario (indoor/outdoor, etc.). Even better, you could use a whole set of different location providers at the same time (that is: a "hybrid" positioning system).</p>
