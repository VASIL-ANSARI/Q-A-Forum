<p>I don't think this is easily solved in C++, but there are approaches for similar cases. You should take a look at the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/bind/bind.html" rel="nofollow">boost::bind and boost::function</a> library. It was made for getting around the nasty details of passing function pointers around in C++ (and they allow to pass for class methods as well). As far as i recall they don't really use a generic N but instantiate templates for arbitrary N parameters. It's definitely worth a look if you want to get to something similar.</p>
