<p>You can do that per column, not per query (which may be your case). For this, use sqlite <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation" rel="nofollow">collations</a>. </p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE user (name VARCHAR(255) COLLATE NOCASE);
</code></pre>

<p>All <code>LIKE</code> operations on this column then will be case insensitive.</p>

<p>You also can <code>COLLATE</code> on queries even though the column isn't declared with a specific collation:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM list WHERE name LIKE '%php%' COLLATE NOCASE
</code></pre>

<p>Note that only ASCII chars are case insensitive by collation. "A" == "a", but "Ã" != "Ã¦"</p>

<p>SQLite allows you to declare new collation types with <code>sqlite_create_collation</code> and them implement the collation logic on the PHP side, but PDO doesn't expose this. </p>
