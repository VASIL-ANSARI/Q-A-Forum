<p>What should happen in the case of overflow?  If you want it to just get to the bottom of the window, use absolute positioning:</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 300px;
  bottom: 0px;
  left: 30px;
  right: 30px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will put the DIV 30px in from each side, 300px from the top of the screen, and flush with the bottom.  Add an <code>overflow:auto;</code> to handle cases where the content is larger than the div.

Edit: @Whoever marked this down, an explanation would be nice... Is something wrong with the answer?</p>
