<p>Nope, there is no previousViewController. UINavigationController is implemented as a stack so you keep pushing view controllers and those can pop themselves off the stack.</p>

<p>FYI, if you're trying to view all the stack of viewcontrollers then UINavigationController has property called "viewControllers" which is implemented as NSArray.</p>
