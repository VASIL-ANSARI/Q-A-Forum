<p>That is actually the correct code. Instead of <code>||</code>, you can also use <code>or</code> (although they differ slightly in <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php" rel="nofollow">operator precedence</a>, not relevant in the case at hand but worth noting, cheers @Timothy.)</p>

<p>I tend to put every condition <code>$a == b</code> into brackets: <code>($a == b)</code> to avoid funny situations in complex <code>if</code> statements.</p>
