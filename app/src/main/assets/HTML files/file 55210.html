<p>I have done like this : each time I want to change the video I create a new AVPlayer and affect it to the playerViewController.player like this </p>

<pre><code>                let url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(path)
                let player = AVPlayer(URL: url)
                playerViewController.player = player
</code></pre>

<p>If someone thinks there is a better way, do not hesitate to answer</p>
