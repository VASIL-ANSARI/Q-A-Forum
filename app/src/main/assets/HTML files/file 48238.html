<p>Do you have touchesCancelled method ? maybe your Touch events are cancelled and not "ended" , try overriding touchesCancelled too </p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches
               withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    [super touchesCancelled:touches withEvent:event];
    super.view.layer.backgroundColor = [self getUntouchedColor];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and can you try just for testing reasons setting [UIColor blackColor] as untouched color ? directly , without converting from hex</p>
