<p>Inside your method you could as well just return <code>null</code> since you get a copy of reference as argument to your method, not the original reference itself. Thus, you cannot modify original reference inside of your method. You can only modify the object this reference refers to.</p>

<p>Right at the end of main, 2 objects will be eligible for GC: one <code>Robocop</code> (with one <code>Integer</code> inside).</p>

<p>After main has finished, JVM will just shut down (in your case) and no GC will happen.</p>
