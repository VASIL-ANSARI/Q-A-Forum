<p>I like to log minor stuff to a database (if it's possible without slowing things down a lot).  It makes it easier to go back and condense results from the log.</p>

<p>For fatal errors, I try to pipe them into FogBugz using <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/docs/40/Articles/BugzScout.html" rel="nofollow">ScoutSubmit</a></p>
