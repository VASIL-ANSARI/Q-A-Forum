<p>First telnet 110 port in your machine to check if the service is running there. In my laptop i don't have a pop3 server running, and this is the result:</p>

<pre><code>hans@andes:~$ telnet localhost 110
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>If the connection succeed, follow the protocol authentication of pop3 with your own data:</p>

<pre><code>hans@andes:~$ telnet mail.foo.com 110
Trying X.X.X.X...
Connected to mail.foo.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK mail.foo.com POP3 server ready
user fooUser
+OK hello fooUser, please enter your password
pass fooPassword
+OK server ready
</code></pre>

<p>In your case telnet localhost; note too that you only should issue the commands: telnet, user and pass. The rest is the response from the server.</p>

<p>If all this works, the problem is on something with your java configuration, check the documentation and samples from the library.</p>
