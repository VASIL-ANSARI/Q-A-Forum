<p>EDIT: Just realized this isn't a fix for the OP's problem.</p>

<p>In addition to Mathias's comment, a fix for this is to first set the radius to 1, then set the individual corner radii:</p>

<pre><code>background.setCornerRadius(1.0f);
background.setCornerRadii(new float [] { topRadius, topRadius,  
                                         topRadius, topRadius,   
                                         bottomRadius, bottomRadius,  
                                         bottomRadius, bottomRadius}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this fixes the problem. As far as getting the corner radii, I don't know of any way to do so... </p>
