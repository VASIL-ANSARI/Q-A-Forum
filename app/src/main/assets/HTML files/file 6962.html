<p>The encrypted message <code>m</code> must be less than <code>n</code>. You can't use values larger than n, because the calculations are done modulo n. In your case <code>m=65</code> and <code>n=35</code>. So you are actually getting the correct answer modulo <code>n</code>, because <code>65 % 35 == 30</code>. </p>
