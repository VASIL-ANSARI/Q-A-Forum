<p>As far as I know, prepared statements does not allow setting a table name. Mostly it only supports ? in values in DML statements (insert, update, delete, select), not DDL.</p>

<p>To create table, you must create a SQL string, such as </p>

<pre><code>String s = "create table " + TABLE_NAME + " (col int) ";
stmt.execute(s);
</code></pre>
