<p>Normally for REST based URL nomenclature the operation (PUT, DELETE, GET etc) is decided by the URI and not my the model. So if you follow the right conventions then DELETE and PUT operations should be different actions on your controller. But if you want to push the operation inside the model then you probably don't need multiple actions. Single action with a single request mapping can consume the user model and then in your service or helper you can do an <code>if else</code> check on the model's <code>action</code> attribute to see what to do about it.</p>
