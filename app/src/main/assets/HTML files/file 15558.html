<p>As far as you hasn't overwritten the <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L938-942" rel="nofollow">Underscore.templateSettings.evaluate</a> setting you should still can use: <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> for evaluate code.</p>

<p>I have seen attempts to also define the <code>Underscore.templateSettings.evaluate</code> setting to match with Mustache syntax but Mustache fights very strong against <em>template evaluations</em> so is gonna be difficult.</p>
