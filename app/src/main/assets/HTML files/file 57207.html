<p>You could use a generic approach:</p>

<pre><code>public class BasicData {}
public class AdvancedData : BasicData { }

public class BasiccControl&lt;T&gt; where T : BasicData
{
    private T data;
    public T Data;
}

public class AdvancedControl : BasicControl&lt;AdvancedData&gt;
{
}    
</code></pre>

<p>So you don't need to override or hide the members in each derivate and still have type safety (as long as you provide the correct generic arguments for <code>T</code>).</p>
