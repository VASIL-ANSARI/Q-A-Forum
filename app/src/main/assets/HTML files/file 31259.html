<p>1) Tough question to answer without seeing the XML schema, I've seen well designed schemas that result in tight, lean XML, and others that are a mess and very bloated. To test it write some test code that serializes your Java objects to a <code>byte[]</code> and compare it's size to the XML payload you currently produce. </p>

<p>2) Might be worth looking into a chunking process, 150MB is pretty large for a single payload. Also are you using GZIP compression for this already? Also may be worth looking at <a href="https://fi.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Fast Infoset</a>. Basically it's a binary encoding for XML that generally helps reduce the size of an XML Document.</p>
