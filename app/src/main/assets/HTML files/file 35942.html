<p>I think your question is formed a bit differently, but the exception is the same so if you're facing the same problem I was then refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20680658/eclipse-detecting-the-same-device-multiple-times">this post</a>. Worked for me.</p>

<p>Actually all I had to do was to exit Eclipse and then end adb.exe in Task Manager. Start Eclipse again and voilÃ , showing only the one device as it should.</p>
