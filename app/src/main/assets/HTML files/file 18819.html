<p>I wouldn't go that way. Build a normal index page, and link to the login form. Then with <code>ujs</code>, set the link as <code>remote</code> (so it's managed asynchronously) and register its handler to show the resulting form in a popup.</p>

<pre><code>(in the view)
link_to new_user_session_path, :remote =&gt; true, :class =&gt; "possibly-modal-dialog"

(in some js or coffee file)
$(document).on "click", "a.possibly-modal-dialog", (event) -&gt;
  event.preventDefault
  # to whatever needed to show the dialog.
</code></pre>

<p>This way, a user without javascript will see the normal link, and a user with javascript will just trigger the modal dialog.</p>
