  <p>How can I collect all my test classes without having to ignore Errors that can occur with classes I'm not interested in?</p>

<p>You've kind of painted yourself into a corner here ...</p>

<p>What I'd do is one (or more) of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>fix the offending classes so that they <em>do</em> load</p></li>
<li><p>put the classes into different directories, create lists of names, or use pattern matching to discriminate between the classes that you do / don't want to add to <code>testCollection</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And log the Errors of course!!  Maybe log them somewhere different, but if you do that leave a <strong>loud</strong> message in the main log that tells someone where to look for details.</p>
