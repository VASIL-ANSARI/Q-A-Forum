<p>Easiest to do it with LINQ-to-Objects...</p>

<pre><code>var qN = new Queue&lt;int&gt;(new[]{3, 4, 9, 11});
var qA = new Queue&lt;int&gt;(new[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13});
var qR = qA.Except(qN);
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE: As long as ModuleDetails implements IEquatable, the code below will work just fine. If you can't modify ModuleDetails, you can always supply an IEqualityComparer as the second argument of Except, which defines how equality is determined.</p>
