<p>You cannot determine that, and that's one of the main reasons you usually rely on higher-level mechanisms to handle memory, such as smart pointers (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr" rel="nofollow"><code>shared_ptr</code></a>, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr" rel="nofollow"><code>unique_ptr</code></a> and so on), or in your case rather <code>std::vector</code>, to deal with raw memory in a way that guarantee no double <code>delete</code>, forgotten <code>delete</code>, or other nasty mistakes that launch your program in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow">undefined behavior</a> land.</p>
