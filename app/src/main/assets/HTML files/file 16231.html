<p>The extension point <code>org.eclipse.jdt.debug.javaLogicalStructures</code> is used to provide the structured view of variables in the "Variables" view... and unfortunately it can only give you a string based result.</p>

<p>In theory, you can add a new plug-in which adds a new command to the "Variables" view (the selection is of type <code>JDILocalVariable</code>)...</p>
