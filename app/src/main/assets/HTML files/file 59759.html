<p>You could make a encoded picture out of it. For example converting it to Base64 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17874733/converting-image-to-base64">Converting Image to Base64</a> and then comparing the strings. Or a Hash of the picture. <a href="http://www.vcskicks.com/image-hash.php" rel="nofollow">hash of a picture</a></p>

<p>I don't know what database you are using and if you can use blobs or something like that, but generally I wouldn't really suggest making an image a primary key on the first thought.</p>
