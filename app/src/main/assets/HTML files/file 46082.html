<p>You want the most liked comment(s) first, followed by the newest.  Your <code>order by</code> is ordering all the comments by the same fields.</p>

<p>You need to find the one you want first, and then to include them in the <code>order by</code> explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT c.*
FROM comments c JOIN
     (SELECT max(likes) as maxl FROM comments WHERE post_id = 19) as m
WHERE c.post_id = 19
ORDER BY (c.likes = m.maxl) DESC, c.date DESC
LIMIT 0, 7;
</code></pre>
