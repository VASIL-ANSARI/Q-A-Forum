  <p>can I get that which intent is getting called if its phone lock</p>

<p>You may be looking for the <code>Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF</code> and <code>Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_ON</code> actions.</p>

<p>But keep the following in mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot receive this through components declared in manifests, only
  by explicitly registering for it with <code>Context.registerReceiver()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To check if the screen is locked, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>KeyguardManager km = (KeyguardManager) context.getSystemService(Context.KEYGUARD_SERVICE);
if (km.isKeyguardLocked()) {
    // locked
} else {
    // not locked
}
</code></pre>
