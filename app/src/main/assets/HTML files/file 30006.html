<p>There's a tutorial with code available in module 8 in <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/wiki/TrainingCourseJune2013/" rel="nofollow">the training material</a>. Take a look at the GateHandler class which:</p>

<ul>
<li>handles a request with a string parameter</li>
<li>creates a GATE document</li>
<li>puts it in a corpus</li>
<li>processes it with a custom pipeline</li>
<li>writes document features in the response</li>
</ul>

<p>GATE embedded is easily integrated in a Spring application (the working example in module 8, running on a jetty server) so you don't have to manually start/manage your pipeline or pass it to the servlet.</p>

<p>Also check the <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/splitch7.html" rel="nofollow">GATE embedded</a> documentation for other ideas on integrating GATE.</p>
