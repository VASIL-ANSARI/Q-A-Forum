<p>First this: using <code>PdfWriter</code>/<code>PdfImportedPage</code> is not a good idea. You throw away all interactive features! Being the author of iText, it's very frustrating to so many people making the same mistake in spite of the fact that I wrote two books about this, and in spite of the fact that I convinced my publisher to offer one of the most important chapters for free: <a href="http://www.manning.com/lowagie2/samplechapter6.pdf">http://www.manning.com/lowagie2/samplechapter6.pdf</a></p>

<p>Is my writing really that bad? Or is there another reason why people keep on merging documents using <code>PdfWriter</code>/<code>PdfImportedPage</code>?</p>

<p>As for your specific questions, here are the answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes. Download the sample chapter and search the PDF file for <code>PageStamp</code>.</li>
<li>Only if you create the PDF in two passes. For instance: create the huge PDF first, then reduce the size by passing it through <code>PdfCopy</code>; or create the merged PDF first with PdfCopy, then add the extra content in a second pass using <code>PdfStamper</code>.</li>
</ol>
