<p>I don't know how Servlet's and the like work however i can give you a rundown of what you need to do. </p>

<p>In DemoServlet you need to take in the input of the Image_Name field and make that one of your parameters of FileUpload</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean processFile(String path, FileItemStream item, String fileName){
    //Method Code
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because currently your processFile method is taking the name of the file from your FileItemStream. You need to change it from that to your actual fileName</p>

<pre><code>File savedFile = new File(f.getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + item.getName());
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>File savedFile = new File(f.getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + fileName + ".png");
</code></pre>
