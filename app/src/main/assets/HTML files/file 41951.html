<p>It seems that since the access is determined by the client and <em>not</em> the contact, the determination should be in the <code>ClientPolicy</code> and <em>not</em> the <code>ContactPolicy</code>.</p>

<p>Pundit policies are simple ruby classes, and there's no rule that says the capability methods need to correspond to controller actions.  From your description, it sounds like the capability you're looking for is whether a client can <code>list_contacts?</code>.  So just write that capability and use it in the action instead of the default <code>index?</code></p>

<pre><code>class ContactsController
  def index
    # assuming you've determined the parent `@client` somehow
    authorize @client, :list_contacts?
    # ...
  end
end

class ClientPolicy
  def list_contacts?
    # your capability logic here
  end
end
</code></pre>
