<p>Did you check the frame of the view/layer after the animation?</p>

<p>I think the problem is, that <em>what you see is <strong>not</strong> what you get</em>. <strong>The layer itself didn't changes its position/frame, but just its <code>presentationLayer</code> did.</strong> Presentation layer is what you actualy see onthe screen. You could see this if you remove this line:</p>

<pre><code>pathAnimation.removedOnCompletion = NO; // Delete or set to YES
</code></pre>

<p>Setting this to <code>NO</code> caused the presentation layer to be on screen at different position than your view.<br>
What you should do, is to <strong>set final position to the layer just before adding the animation</strong> to it.</p>

<pre><code>view.layer.position = finalPosition; // You should calculate this
[view.layer addAnimation:pathAnimation forKey:@"arc"];
</code></pre>
