<p>You can find the answer for yourself by logging the screen name to the console after you set it:</p>

<pre><code>// log which screen name Google Analytics is associated with right now
String screenName = tracker.get("&amp;cd");
Log.d("GA Screen Name", screenName == null ? "(not set)" : screenName);
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this helps you debug your problem. Sorry for the indirect answer; I don't have enough reputation for a comment.</p>
