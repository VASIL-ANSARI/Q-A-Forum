<p>Explicitly catch the timeout exception: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.timeout" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.timeout</a></p>

<pre><code>try:
    image_file = urllib2.urlopen(submission.url, timeout = 5)
except urllib2.URLError as e:
    print(e)
    continue
except socket.Timeouterror:
    print("timed out")
    # Your timeout handling code here...
else:
    with open('/home/mona/computer_vision/image_retrieval/images/'+category+'/' + datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%y-%m-%d-%s') + submission.url[-5:], 'wb') as output_image:
        output_image.write(image_file.read())
</code></pre>

<p>OP:
Thanks!
I had these thanks to your suggestion and my problem was solved for Python2.7:</p>

<pre><code>except socket.timeout as e:
    print(e)
    continue
except socket.error as e:
    print(e)
    continue
</code></pre>
