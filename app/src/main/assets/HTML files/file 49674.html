<p>You could use the dependent frequency:</p>

<pre><code>f = f(w1 and w2) / f(w1 or w2)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>f(w1 and w2)</code> is the number of slots where both words appear and <code>f(w1 or w2)</code> is the number of slots where at least one of both words appears. If both words only appear together, you get <code>f = 1</code>. If both words never appear together, you get <code>f = 0</code>.</p>

<p>You can easily map this to a distance-like value via <code>distance = k * (1 - f)</code> for some scaling factor <code>k</code>.</p>
