<p>Normalisation is not a Django or even Python concept - it is a wider approach to designing a relational database schema such that you remove duplication and eliminate redundancy. </p>

<p>In django this means that rather than have one model, you might have multiple smaller models, which represent the relationship between database tables via <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/" rel="nofollow"><code>ForeignKey</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/" rel="nofollow"><code>ManyToMany</code></a> fields provided by the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/examples/" rel="nofollow">Model API</a>.</p>

<p>So using an example contrived from the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/" rel="nofollow">django docs</a>, say we work for a newspaper company and we want to keep track of each reporter and the articles they publish. You might design a model like this first off</p>

<pre><code>class Newspaper(models.Model):
    reporter = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    email = models.EmailField()
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=100)
</code></pre>

<p>If we populate this model, we are going to have redundancy as soon as a reporter publishes more than one article, as we will be duplicating email information, storing the same email address in multiple rows. This is a problem, as in the future if we want to update a reporters email address, we might a miss row and corrupt our data.</p>

<p>So we could start to improve on this and begin to normalise our model by defining two separate tables, which use a <code>ForeignKey</code> field to map the many-to-one relationship (aka that a reporter can publish many articles, but an article only has one reporter).</p>

<pre><code>class Reporter(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    email = models.EmailField()

class Article(models.Model):
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    reporter = models.ForeignKey(Reporter)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we won't be duplicating the reporters email address, as we can store this ONCE in the Reporter table, making it easier to update this value in the future.</p>

<p>Now this is a somewhat contrived answer, and I'm sure you could go further to improve this design, but hopefully it demonstrates the point. I really recommend you read the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/examples/" rel="nofollow">django docs which talk about the modeling of relationships</a> and the <a href="http://www.studytonight.com/dbms/database-normalization.php" rel="nofollow">various degrees of normalisation</a>.</p>
