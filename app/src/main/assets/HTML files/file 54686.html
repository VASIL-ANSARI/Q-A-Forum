<p>So it turns out that on the <code>Braintree_Transaction::sale</code> method using the fake-nonce isn't the way you do it. You do it with the amount. You match the amount to the error code you want to produce. So an amount of <code>2001.00</code> will get a response of <code>"Insufficient Funds"</code>. A list of error codes can be found <a href="https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/transactions/declines#authorization-decline-codes" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
