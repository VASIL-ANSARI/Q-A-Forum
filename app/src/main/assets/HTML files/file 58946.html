<p>Try having the view controller that does the presentation also do the dismiss.</p>

<p>So in your unwind segue:</p>

<pre><code>UIView.animateWithDuration(4000.milliseconds, delay: 0.seconds, options: .curveEaseInOut, animations: {
        fromView.frame = targetFrame
    }) { (finished) in
        self.destination.dismiss(animated: false, completion: nil) // the destination is the one that presented the current view
    }
</code></pre>
