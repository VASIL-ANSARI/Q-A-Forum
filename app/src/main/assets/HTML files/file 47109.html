<p>Look at this line here: </p>

<pre><code>if (mInQuestion == yes) {
</code></pre>

<p>You are trying to check if <code>mInQuestion</code> is the string <code>"yes"</code>, but you are actually checking to see if it is equal to a variable <code>yes</code> that doesn't exist. Put quotes around the <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code>.</p>

<p>Also note this line: </p>

<pre><code>if (experience &amp;&amp; interest == yes||y) {
</code></pre>

<p>You can not check multiple conditions like this, you must be explicit with each check:</p>

<pre><code>if ((experience == 'yes' || experience == 'y') &amp;&amp; (interest == 'yes' || interest == 'y'))
</code></pre>

<p>Also, everywhere you are trying to call <code>toLowerCase</code> is incorrect. You are trying to call a function, but are leaving off the parentheses. This means that your variables are actually functions, not strings like you intended. Put parentheses after each call to <code>toLowerCase</code></p>
