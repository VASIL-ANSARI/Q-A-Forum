<p>From the looks of things, this puts three parameters onto the stack -- two ints coming from <code>edx</code> and <code>eax</code>, plus what looks like an address -- presumably the address it picked to store the string literal (i.e., the format string). After that, it calls <code>printf</code>.</p>

<p>So, the bottom line is that it looks like a pretty straightforward implementation of the source code you gave in your question.</p>
