<p>I found mistake while comparing this code with the provided solutions to the book. 
Mistake was made in the .xib file, when making connections with the file's owner. Unfortunately in the book there is no information on how to properly do that. </p>

<p>the mistake was made in choosing wrong action for the button. Instead of choosing "Did end on ending" the option "Touch Up Inside" have to be chosen. 
That fixed the issue.    </p>
