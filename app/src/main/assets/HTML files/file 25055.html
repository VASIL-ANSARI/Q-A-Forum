<p>Try using breakpoints in the script you need to start looking into.</p>

<p>Select the first line (or the line you expect script to stop at), click with the mouse on the left side bar on this line or press (Ctrl/Cmd + F8) and start the debugger. When it'll stop in the index.php just press Resume (F9) to stop at the breakpoint.</p>

<p>If you don't like that debugging stops at the first line of your script you can uncheck the "Force break at the first line when..." box under PHP -> Debug -> Xdebug tabs.</p>
