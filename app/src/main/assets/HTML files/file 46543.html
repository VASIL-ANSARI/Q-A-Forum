<p>You have to pass the <code>id</code> parameter to the page when you access it from your browser. So, if your page is at <code>http://www.example.com/test.php</code>, you need to type into your browser <code>http://www.example.com/test.php?id=123</code>, where <code>123</code> is your ID value.</p>

<p>This is why this is happening:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Running the following will always redirect immediately to the "list.php" page</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because <code>$_GET['id']</code> is empty. Removing this check causes the page to always returns <code>NULL</code> because you're passing <code>null</code> to be bound to <code>:id</code>, which must not return any rows from the DB. </p>
