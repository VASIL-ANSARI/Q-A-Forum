<p>The problem is that django is listening on <code>localhost</code> this means you won't be able to access the server directly via the internet. To change that you can specify the port/hostname for django:</p>

<pre><code>./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8002
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to make the server directly accessible via the internet you can do port forwarding with ssh:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L8002:localhost:8002 server
</code></pre>

<p>This will forward your local port 8002 via ssh to the remote server.</p>
