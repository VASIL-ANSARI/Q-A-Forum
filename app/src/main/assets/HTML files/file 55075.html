<p>Try to write:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input ng-model="some_value" change-case&gt; //camel-case
</code></pre>

<p>This is explained in <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive" rel="nofollow">angular docs</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Normalization</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Angular normalizes an element's tag and attribute name
  to determine which elements match which directives. We typically refer
  to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g.
  ngModel). However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to
  directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using
  dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).</p>
  
  <p>The normalization process is as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes. </li>
  <li>Convert or _-delimited name to camelCase.</li>
  </ul>
