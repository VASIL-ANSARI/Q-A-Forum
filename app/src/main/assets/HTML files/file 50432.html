<p>You can place the enum in a separate .cfg file, as configuration data, then each of the other source files reads that configuration file.  </p>

<p>Then when the configuration file is changed, no re-compile is needed.  </p>

<p>All the other files read/parse the configuration file.</p>

<p>This is the classic method of handling such info.</p>

<p>Note: the configuration file would not contain an enum but rather certain formatted data.</p>
