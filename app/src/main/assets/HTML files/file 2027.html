<p>If you just want a library to do the work for you check out <a href="http://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu" rel="nofollow">DroidFu</a>. There's a writeup <a href="http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/droid-fu-part-2-webimageview-and-webgalleryadapter" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise you'll have to spin off a new thread (probably using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">AsyncTask</a>) that does the HTTP get and assigns it to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html" rel="nofollow">ImageView</a>s.</p>

<p>I know this is kind of high-level, but there is TONS of info out there about how to do HTTP gets and using AsyncTask.</p>
