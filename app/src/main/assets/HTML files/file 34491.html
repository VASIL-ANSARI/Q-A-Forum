<p>Check that R.java belongs to the package namespace as that of your .java file(in which you have writen setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);.
However if the package names are not same then you have to import com.xyz.R.</p>

<p>If the java file and R.java belongs to the same package namespace then clean your project and restart eclipse.</p>

<p>Also check your xml files.If there are any errors in your xml file then R.java will not generate.</p>
