<p>I would say : start simple. One table for the animals with a type column (it can be an explicit varchar like 'DOG' and 'CAT'), and one table for the races, with also a type column. It will be easier to plug an ORM on top of that, and easier to query if you have to run some statistics.</p>

<p>Only possible troubles with this is are :
- more and more columns that will be exclusive to one animal, leading to some heavy refactoring
- a possible mismatch between the TYPE columns of a Pet and its Race if the application messes with the data</p>
