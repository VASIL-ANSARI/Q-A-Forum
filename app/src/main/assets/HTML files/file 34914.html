<p><strong>These following are not supported on iOS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mouse-over events</strong></p>

<p>The user cannot âmouse-overâ a nonclickable element on iOS. The element must be clickable for a mouseover event to occur as described in âOne-Finger Events.â</p>

<p><strong>Hover styles</strong></p>

<p>Since a mouseover event is sent only before a mousedown event, hover styles are displayed only if the user touches and holds a clickable element with a hover style. Read âHandling Eventsâ for all the events generated by gestures on iOS.</p>

<p>This implies that <strong>:hover</strong> is only supported on clickable elements. Clickable events are defined here as:</p>

<p>A clickable element is a link, form element, image map area, or any other element with mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, or onclick handlers.</p>

<p>With that said, if you want to provide a consistent and reliable user experience on iOS, your best bet is to design for touch, since that's what it's made for. <strong>This is a part of the answer from previously asked questions</strong></p>
