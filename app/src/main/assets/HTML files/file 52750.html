<p>A number of resources exist for implementing a custom UI for Android. The main difference between them is that you must tokenize payment methods manually. Use the CardBuilder class to tokenize your own payment methods.</p>

<pre><code>CardBuilder cardBuilder = new CardBuilder()
    .cardNumber("4111111111111111")
    .expirationDate("09/2018");

Card.tokenize(mBraintreeFragment, cardBuilder);
</code></pre>
