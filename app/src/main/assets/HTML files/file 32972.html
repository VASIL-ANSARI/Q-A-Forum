  <p>Q: Why isn't there a runtime error when I run the executable generated by clang?</p>

<p>Because undefined behaviour is undefined. The program tries to access an object after its lifetime is over. C++ defines no behaviour for such programs.</p>

<p><code>make_unique</code> and move semantics for <code>unique_ptr</code> etc are great, and things like this are just yet another reason they are what you should be using.</p>
