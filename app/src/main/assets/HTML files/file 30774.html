<p>This is the principle  of a structure, you can put all type of variable you want in it ..</p>

<p>I think you want to create an array of int.
Declaring like :</p>

<pre><code>int tab["number of int you want"];
</code></pre>

<p>And access it like that :</p>

<pre><code>tab["number of case of the int you want to access"];
</code></pre>
