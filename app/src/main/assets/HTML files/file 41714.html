<blockquote>
  <p>When an exception is thrown, code following the statement will not be executed, and PHP will attempt to find the first matching catch block.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The catch block for <code>Exception</code> will be executed since <code>Exception</code> is a parent of <code>UserException</code> and therefore any object of type <code>UserException</code> is also of type <code>Exception</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore you should refactor your code to have the catch block for child classes first. In your case <code>UserException</code> should be first.</p>
