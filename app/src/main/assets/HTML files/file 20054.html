<p>I've never used Angular - nevertheless this may help.</p>

<p>Does this JavaScript make an Ajax request to one of your CI's controllers? If so, CI now has the <code>is_ajax_request()</code> method, which allows you to check if a request (POST or GET) is coming via ajax. You can proceed differently based on a request coming from Ajax vs a normal request.</p>
