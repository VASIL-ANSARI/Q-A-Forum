<p>You need to have the device ID of all devices you use in the provisioning profile. The minimum OS version of the project must be &lt;= your device OS version. If the device is an arm6 based device you might have accidentially disabled dual builing for arm6/arm7.</p>

<p>I think you probably set the deployment target too high and/or statically linked a framework that required >= iOS 4</p>

<p>PS: it is also very likely that Jailbreaking is responsible for the device not being recognized by the organizer. Have a look at the console log both on Xcode and on the device. Jailbreaking might be causing a crash in your baseband when Xcode tries to probe it.</p>
