<p>You can't access GA withouth authentication for rather the same reason you cannot access you bank account without authentication (because that would allow everybody else to access your account without authentication which might cause some inconvenience).</p>

<p>Google provides a complete example for GA access via Javascript: <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/articles/hello-analytics-api" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/articles/hello-analytics-api</a>. However I don't think that's what you want (I think for that you need to be logged in to Google to actually retrieve data). </p>

<p>You could however use Google Apps Script to pull data into a Google Spreadsheet and embed  that into your page (at least I think that should be safe).</p>

<p>Updated: Google has since released the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy" rel="nofollow">Google Analytics superProxy</a> which allows to share Analytics data with the public safely.</p>
