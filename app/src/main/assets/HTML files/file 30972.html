<p>You can do this by using an expression in the <code>order by</code> clause.</p>

<pre><code>select *
from tablename
where tags like '%Cars%' OR like '%Luxury%'
order by (tags like '%Cars%') + (tags like '%Luxury%') desc;
</code></pre>

<p>MySQL treats booleans results as numbers.  So adding them together gives the number of matches.</p>
