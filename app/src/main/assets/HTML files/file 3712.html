<p>You can make a server-side page in ASP.Net that connects to any website and tells you whether it's up.<br>
Since it would be hosted at the same domain as your Silverlight app, it would work fine.  (ASP.Net has no such restrictions)</p>

<p>Note that it would then check whether the server can connect to the website rather than the client.</p>
