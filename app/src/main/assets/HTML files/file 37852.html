<p>Assuming the that different versions <em>are</em> needed, and the plugins are written following <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/" rel="nofollow">the correct pattern</a>, don't use <code>noConflict</code>, but simply position the scripts such that plugins have access to the correct <code>window.jQuery</code> when they are executed.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- plugins that "only work with" 1.7.2: $/jQuery refer to 1.7.2 --&gt;
&lt;script src="js/jquery.slicknav.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- everything else: $/jQuery refer to 1.9.1 (but consider 1.11+) --&gt;
&lt;script src="js/owl.carousel.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The use of giving a different name with noConflict is that so code that <em>knows</em> about the different name can use it - which is not the case for a standard plugin.</p>

<p>However, consider simply using the latest 1.x (currently 1.11.1) for <em>all</em> the plugins, as jQuery is very backwards-compatible with few surprising changes (the deprecation roadmap is long). In cases where legacy features are used, <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/" rel="nofollow">there is <strong>jquery-migrate.js</strong> to shim changes for older code</a> which can eliminate many such migration issues.</p>

  <p>[jQuery-migrate] can be used to detect and restore APIs or features that have been deprecated in jQuery and removed as of version 1.9. </p>
