<p>Unfortunately there is no language feature by which you can (portably) distinguish a pointer which points to a dynamically allocated memory from the one that doesn't. You can just manually keep a list of indices for which it was allocated dynamically. Or alternatively, choose to ALWAYS allocate on the heap, if performance is not a great issue.</p>
