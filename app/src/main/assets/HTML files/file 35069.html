<p>A possible solution is to set all the cookies to expired for each of the rquests at the end of a single test as so:</p>

<pre><code>    yield return ..
    yield return ..
    yield return ..

    foreach (Cookie cookie in LoadLoginFormPageRequest.Cookies)
                cookie.Expired = true;

    foreach (Cookie cookie in PostLoginData.Cookies)
        cookie.Expired = true;

    foreach (Cookie cookie in PostLoginPageRequest.Cookies)
        cookie.Expired = true;
</code></pre>
