<p>This is not a valid URL. Try running it through Postman or another REST tool and you'll see that no matter what it returns 400 Bad Request. Chrome just happens to display the <code>[]</code> in the browser instead of displaying an error message. Have you applied for a Steam API key?</p>

<p>It's rare that an API will allow public access without requiring that you include a token with your request. I don't see anywhere in your code where you're attaching it so I'm going to assume no. I suggest you sign up for their program.</p>
