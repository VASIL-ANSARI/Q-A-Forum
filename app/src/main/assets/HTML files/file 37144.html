<p><code>text()</code> shouldn't work to retrieve the value of an input. It's for retrieving the inner <em>text</em> of an element.</p>

<p><code>val()</code> is your friend here; not at all sure why you'd think it was vulnerable to injection. It simply collects the value -- as plain text, without interpretation -- that's been entered in.</p>

<p>By all means, output it later in a way that escapes any HTML that may be found - either by using <code>text()</code> to render it as the contents of an element, or <code>document.createTextNode()</code> to create safe text to append to an element.</p>
