<p>It's probably the <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/" rel="nofollow">awesome firefox3 fsync "bug"</a>, which is a giant pile of fail.</p>

<p>In summary</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database</li>
<li>Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times</li>
<li>SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written</li>
<li>Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.</li>
<li>The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.</li>
</ul>
