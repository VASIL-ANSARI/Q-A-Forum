<p>You should take a look at <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/websocket.html#websocket-stomp-message-flow" rel="nofollow">this part of the reference documentation</a>.
In a nutshell, <code>"/topic"</code> and <code>"/queue"</code> are both prefixes configured to the same destination.</p>

<p>In the documentation, <code>"/app"</code> is the configured "application destination prefix" - meaning all messages flowing in through the <code>"clientInboundChannel"</code> and matching those prefixes will be mapped to your application, for example with <code>@MessageMapping</code> annotations.</p>

<p>Here also, <code>"/topic"</code> and <code>"/queue"</code> are both prefixes configured as STOMP destinations - meaning all messages flowing in through the <code>"clientInboundChannel"</code> and matching those prefixes will be forwarded to the STOMP broker. In your case, that's the simple broker implementation.</p>

<p>So from Spring Websocket's point of view, <code>"/queue"</code> and <code>"/topic"</code> are treated the same way and are "typical" STOMP destinations - all messages matching those are forwarded to the messages broker. Now if you're using a full message broker implementation, those destinations may not have the same meaning and the message broker behavior could be different. Here are some examples with <a href="https://activemq.apache.org/apollo/documentation/stomp-manual.html#Destination_Types" rel="nofollow">Apache Apollo</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html#d" rel="nofollow">RabbitMQ</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if you want to, you can change those prefixes. But I would advise you to keep those as defaults unless you really know what you're doing.</p>
