<p>First you should use <code>$_GET</code> and not <code>$_POST</code>. Second you don't need to call your function parameter as <code>$_GET</code>. You can do this:</p>

<pre><code>function login($array)
{
   // do stuff with array
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then call the function in this way:</p>

<pre><code>login($_GET);
</code></pre>

<p>An additional suggest is to read the following quote and that is the difference of <strong>actual parameters</strong> towards <strong>formal parameters</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Formal parameters are the parameters as they are known in the function
  definition. Actual parameters (also known as arguments) are what are
  passed by the caller.</p>
