<p>You should decide what kind of similarity comparison you need. There are geometric algorithms. They use edge detection and then try to match detected edges in both images. They are probably useful when dealing with different colours of objects with the same shape. And there are algorithms that are more based on colour similarity. They compare what colours are in the image and how they are distributed.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a concrete algorithm, you probably should have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform" rel="nofollow">Hough Transform</a>.</p>
