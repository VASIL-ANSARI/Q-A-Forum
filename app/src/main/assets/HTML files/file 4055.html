<p>Global variables are "<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/runtime.html#App_Caching" rel="nofollow">app-cached</a>."  This means that <em>each</em> particular instance of your app will remember these variables' values between requests.  However, when an instance is shutdown these values will be lost.  Thus I do not think you really want to store these values in module-level variables (unless they are constants which do not need to be updated).</p>

<p>I think your original solution will work fine.  You could even create the original entity using the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html" rel="nofollow">remote API</a> tool so that you don't need an obscure page to instantiate the one and only <code>Company</code> object.</p>

<p>You can also make the retrieval of the singleton <code>Company</code> entity a bit faster if you retrieve it by key.</p>

<p>If you will need to retrieve this entity frequently, then you can avoid round-trips to the datastore by using a caching technique.  The fastest would be to app-cache  the <code>Company</code> entity after you've retrieved it from the datastore.  To protect against the entity from becoming too out of date, you can also app-cache the time you last retrieved the entity and if that time is more than N seconds old then you could re-fetch it from the datastore.
