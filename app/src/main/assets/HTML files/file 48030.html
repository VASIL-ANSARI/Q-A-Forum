<p>It depends on what you mean by unused code. </p>

<p>For unreachable dead code, like functions are were never called, classes that are never instantiated, you can use a pure static code analyzer to find them. <a href="http://pylint.org/" rel="nofollow">Pylint</a> is a good option. Bear in mind that this is not 100% accurate, false positive is possible:</p>

<pre><code># static analysis can't detect methods called this way
func = getattr(obj, "func_name")
func() 
</code></pre>

<p>For code that are reachable, but never reached. You have to rely on tools like <code>coverage.py</code>, and improve your test coverage.</p>
