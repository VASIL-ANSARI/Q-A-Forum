<p>It's not clear to me from the context what exactly you're doing (maybe the 2nd <code>points</code> is supposed to be <code>points_was</code>?).  For mildly improved clarity, depending on who you ask, and with fewer lines:</p>

<pre><code>...
  user_was = User.find(user_id_was)
  user_was.update_column :points, user_was.points - points_was
  user.update_column     :points, user.points     + points
...
</code></pre>
