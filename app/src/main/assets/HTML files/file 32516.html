  <p>So the issue isn't with the modem. </p>

<p>Troubleshooting problems get to be difficult when you eliminate the <em>one</em> source of the problem.  Of course it is a modem issue, you've verified that everything, up to the modem, works properly.  But yes, it gets to be difficult once it arrives at the modem okay, the fax protocol just doesn't have great ways to provide diagnostics.  Something as simple as the receiver thinking that you are sending it a spam fax with way too many pages cannot be diagnosed.  It unceremoniously hangs up the phone and that's the end of it.</p>

<p>Following the troubleshooting guidelines in the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736119%28v=ws.10%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Technet article</a>.  Especially take the next step, the one that the event log message recommends you take but you appear not to have taken.  I'll quote it from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To access the fax activity log:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>To open Windows Explorer, right-click Start, and then click Explore.<br></li>
  <li>In the left pane, click the disk that contains the operating system.<br></li>
  <li>On the toolbar, click Organize, click Folder and Search Options, click the View tab, and then click Show Hidden Files and Folders. Close the dialog box.</li>
  <li>In Windows Explorer, navigate to %systemdrive%\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\ActivityLog.</li>
  <li>View the file InboxLog.txt. Each row in InboxLog.txt is an incoming fax job. In the row for a given failed incoming fax transmission, review the Status and Extended Status fields for information about the failure.</li>
  </ul>

<p>If still necessary, ask more questions about this at the <a href="http://serverfault.com/">StackExchange site for server admins</a>, the one site where you can expect to find people that have dealt with fax problems before.</p>
