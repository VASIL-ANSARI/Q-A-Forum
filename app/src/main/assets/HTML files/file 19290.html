<p>When it comes to Database Connection object, the best is: <strong>To open as late as possible and close as early as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>In C# there is a <code>using</code> statement which works with objects implementing IDisposable interface. <code>using</code> statement works like try/finally block of code. IMO the general practice for handling connection should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
connection = new Connection();
connection.Open(); // open the connection
//work with the connection, DB CRUD operations
}
finally
{
if(connection != null)
     connection.Close(); // close the connection in finally block
                         // so that even if the exception occurs, connection gets closed. 
}
</code></pre>

<p>For your options, I believe the first one is the worst, which holds the connetion object along with the object of the class. </p>

<p>I think you <strong>should be more concerned about opening/closing the connection</strong> rather than holding the object of the connection in multiple places. </p>
