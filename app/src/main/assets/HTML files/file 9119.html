<p>The reason this happening more than likely is related to the following line.</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *rowData = [self.userArray objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to add a call to <code>[self.userArray removeAllObjects];</code> to the logout method and I would recommend adding to login method but required.</p>
