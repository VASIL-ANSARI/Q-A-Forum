<p>Bear with me if the procedure is quite long but this procedure helped me to create self-sign CA during our development.</p>

<p><strong>Steps on how to create self-signed certificate:</strong></p>

<p>Assumptions:   </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Visual Studio was already installed (2012/2013/2015).</p></li>
<li><p>You have already basic knowlegdge of digital certificate (x.509).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:    </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open Visual Studio Tools and choose Developer Command Prompt for
VS2013/VS2012 as an administrator. And navigate or cd to location
where you want to save your certificates.    </p></li>
<li><p>We need to create first Root Authority as our CA for signing
certificate. To create Root Authority certificate, we used
makecert.exe tool that comes from visual studio. For more detail
regarding makecert.exe please refer here.</p>

<pre><code>Command: makecert ân âCN=DevRootCAâ âr âsv DevRootCA.pvk DevRootCA.cer        
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Explanation: The command above will generate a root authority
certificate for signing certificate.
   Create self-signed certificate using our Root Authority certificate came from Step 2.</p>

<pre><code>Command: makecert âpe ân âCN= localhostâ âss my âsky exchange âsk DevCert âiv DevRootCA.pvk âic DevRootCA.cer âsr localmachine DevCert.cer
Explanation: The command above will create and store certificate named âDevCert.cerâ and it will be stored in Local Computer. To view certificates stored in your local computer Use Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe). Please refer here    
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In able for the server and client to trust each certificate named
âDevCert.cerâ you need to install Root Authority certificate in
client and server.</p>

<pre><code>Open Microsoft Management Console and follow here.
Navigate to Certificate (Local Computer)
