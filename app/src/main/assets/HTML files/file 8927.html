<pre><code>SELECT TOP 1 COUNT(*) as total FROM dbo.Table GROUP BY b_id ORDER BY total DESC
</code></pre>

<p>edit:
ups, mysql equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM dbo.Table GROUP BY b_id ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>edit2:

<pre><code>SELECT b_id FROM dbo.Table GROUP BY b_id ORDER BY COUNT(b_id) DESC LIMIT 1
</code></pre>
