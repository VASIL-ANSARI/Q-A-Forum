<p>i'm not familiar with the workings of c# and .net, but if this was java, i would say:</p>

<p>store the current parameters into an arraylist or map</p>

<p>you could either have 3 arraylists, one for each of the parameters that go into the addInParameters method call, or a map with all the values included in it (the type parameter would need to have some duplication as it does now) </p>

<p>use the array list as the only parameter in the insert/update methods
use a for loop so that the AddInParameter call is only written once, and the parameters are like (array1[0], array2[0], array3[0]) rather than the actual values.</p>

<p>in php you could use associative arrays, does .net have associative arrays?</p>
