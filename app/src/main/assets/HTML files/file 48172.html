<p>For me it doesn't seem like you are actually using port 8080. Apache tries to use the ports 80 and 443, which are already blocked by Skype.</p>

<p>And whatever that is <code>""D:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin\mysqld" --defaults-file="D:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\my.ini" MySQL"</code>, it blocks your port 3306 for mysql.</p>

<p>You should either kill those processes or change the ports for Apache and MySql again. For Apache use the "config" button and than edit the <code>httpd.conf</code> file. In that file change the line <code>Listen 80</code> to <code>Listen 8080</code>. After that make sure that you save your changes.</p>

<p>Same for MySql and port 3306 if you want to use it (here it is <code>my.ini</code>).</p>
