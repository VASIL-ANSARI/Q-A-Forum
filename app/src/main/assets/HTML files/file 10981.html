<p>If I m right then. You have a User Control. Say wucMyControl.ascx, where you have a gridview control gvGDG. And u are unable to access it from wucMyControl.ascx.cs. If its the problem then use the solution below:</p>

<p>In your user controls designer file check the access level of the Gridview control. Might be it will get changed to private, accidently , instead of  protected. If its private , make it protected or public and check whether you are able to access it now or not.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
FYI, you can't access directly the child controls. For this you need to access in  the controls DataBound event. </p>

<p>Here in your case :</p>

<pre><code>protected void GridView_RowDataBound(sender, e)
{
    if(e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowtype.DataRow)
     {
          var ddl = (DropdownList)e.Row.FindControl("ddlCountry");
          // do whatever you want with ddl. Similarly you can find all html and server control inside a gridview.
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will help you...</p>

<p>Adding event to gridview child controls</p>

<p>In your <code>GridView1_RowDataBound</code> method, add the handler when you create the drop down by calling <code>ddl.SelectedIndexChanged += new EventHandler(ddl_SelectedIndexChanged);</code></p>

<p>Then, declare the <code>void ddl_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)</code> method to handle your logic. The sender argument will be a reference to the drop down's that was selected. Also set AutoPostback property of the drodownlist to true.</p>
