  <p><strong>Option  1</strong></p>

<p>You need to create a trigger on the table for insert.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>create trigger forinsertrig1 
on salesdetail 
for insert 
as 
if (select count(*) 
    from titles, inserted 
    where titles.title_id = inserted.title_id) !=
    @@rowcount 
/* Cancel the insert and print a message.*/
  begin
    rollback transaction 
    print "No, the title_id does not exist in
    titles." 
  end  
/* Otherwise, allow it. */
else
  print "Added! All title_idâs exist in titles."
</code></pre>

<p>But in the trigger you'll update the slot that doesn't have any value (the last inserted) to be the value of the first missing id.</p>

<p>To discover the first missing id you can do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>select the min(id) from the table</li>
<li>Make a cycle incrementing the id and selecting the row from the table. The first one that doesn't have a row, it's your missing slot</li>
</ol>

<p>Another possibility, like stated by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/95353/elzo-valugi">Elzo Valugi</a> is to use the increment logic to build a function that will return you the next available slot and make the entry directly on the insert.</p>
