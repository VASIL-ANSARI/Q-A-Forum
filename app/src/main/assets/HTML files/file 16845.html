  <p>But I want my application to appear in this dialog only for urls opened from inside my app.</p>

<p>This is not possible, sorry.</p>

<p>You <em>might</em> be able to fake this behavior through enabling and disabling this component via <code>PackageManager</code> and <code>setComponentEnabledSetting()</code>, such that it is only enabled when it is likely that such a URL will be encountered. However, it may be difficult to get this to be 100% reliable.</p>
