<p>There is no interface or base type that you can apply to the type to ensure it has a parameterless constructor.  The only context in which you can make such a contraint is generic constraints:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Foo&lt;T&gt;()
    where T : new() {}
</code></pre>

<p>In such a case the only types that can be used with <code>Foo</code> must have a parameterless constructor.</p>
