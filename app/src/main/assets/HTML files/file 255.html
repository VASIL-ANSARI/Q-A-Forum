<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/mimetypes.html">mimetypes module</a> in the standard library will determine/guess the MIME type from a file extension.</p>

<p>If users are uploading files the HTTP post will contain the MIME type of the file alongside the data.  For example, Django makes this data available as an attribute of the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/file-uploads/#uploadedfile-objects">UploadedFile</a> object.</p>
