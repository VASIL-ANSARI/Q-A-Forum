<p>I've tested this with a csv file with one column and it worked. I'm assuming you only want to display your result</p>

<pre><code>import csv
import operator

sample = open("file.csv", "r")
csv_file = csv.reader(sample, delimiter=",")
sort = sorted(csv_file)
for eachline in sort:
    print eachline
</code></pre>
