<p>For your example, you can use <code>case</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select (case when my_year is not null and my_year &lt;&gt; 0 and
                  my_year between -4713 and 9999
             then TO_DATE(my_year || '-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
        end)
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, Oracle does not have a method of doing the conversion, if possible, and otherwise returning NULL.  SQL Server recently introduced <code>try_convert()</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>One option is to write your own function with an exception handler for the failed conversion.  The exception handler would simply return <code>NULL</code> for a bad format.</p>
