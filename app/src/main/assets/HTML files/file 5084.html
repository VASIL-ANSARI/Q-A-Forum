<p>Weird bug, I agree. I get the same behaviour that you are describing (Chrome 7.0.517.44 under Windows). In my case, if the bug occurs, I don't even get the entire text displayed when the script finishes.</p>

<p>One trick that seems to work for me is to alternate the appearance of the caret (I guess it forces Chrome to do some rerendering). It's ugly, I know, and obviously a lot slower (albeit not visibly on my machine), but perhaps you can use it as a temporary workaround? </p>

<pre><code>var letterIndex = 0;
var intervalId = 0;

function writeOneLetter(myString)
{
  var char = myString[letterIndex];
  $('#display').append(char);
  $('#caret').css("font-weight", letterIndex % 2 ? "bold" : "normal");
  letterIndex++;
  if (letterIndex &gt;= myString.length)
  {
    letterIndex = 0;
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: setting the caret character to bold doesn't actually visibly change its appearance, so you wont actually see the alternation for each character. </p>
