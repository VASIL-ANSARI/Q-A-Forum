<p>To get the result you want, you might try to turn on heavy optimization, so run the program in <code>-server</code> mode.</p>

<p>I first thought of making <code>f</code> <code>volatile</code>, but that would obviously screw the whole experiment.</p>

<p>Turn on the XML logging for the just-in-time compiler (if you are using the HotSpot JVM), and look at the generated machine code (using some external debugger or memory dumper). Then you can examine the generated code if that would even <em>allow</em> you to observe the result you want.</p>
