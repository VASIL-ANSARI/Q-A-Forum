<p>There is a Jquery Plugin called livequery which covers your requirements.</p>

<p>I like to think of this plugin as Jquery .live() but without the need for an event ('click') etc. (It actually listens for dom events)</p>

<p>You can find more info here//</p>

<p>Your example would be as follows</p>

<pre><code>$('.some_class').livequery(function() {  $(this).append('something');});
</code></pre>
