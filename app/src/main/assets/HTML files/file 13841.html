<p>I've resolved this by running:</p>

<pre><code>gem install bundler
</code></pre>

<p>If you try that and it shows you have bundler installed, try typing:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rake db:schema:dump
</code></pre>

<p>You may be running the command outside the scope of the current bundle. </p>

<p>Here's a bit more background information on why you need to add <code>bundle exec</code> in front of your rake commands:</p>

<p>Also, note that <code>rake</code> isn't required in your 'Gemfile' as long as you have <code>rails</code> specified. <code>rake</code> installs as a dependency of <code>rails</code>. To see the correlation, take a look at your <code>Gemfile.lock</code>.</p>

<p>Once you install rvm, add the following to a file named <code>.rvmrc</code> in the root directory of your project:</p>

<pre><code>if [[ -d "${rvm_path:-$HOME/.rvm}/environments" \
  &amp;&amp; -s "${rvm_path:-$HOME/.rvm}/environments/ruby-1.9.3-p125@MYPROJECTNAME" ]] ; then
  \. "${rvm_path:-$HOME/.rvm}/environments/ruby-1.9.3-p125@MYPROJECTNAME"  
else
  rvm --create use  "ruby-1.9.3-p125@MYPROJECTNAME"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Substitute your project name for "MYPROJECTNAME" and the appropriate ruby version where you see <code>ruby-1.9.3-p125</code>. Then when you change into that directory, rvm will automatically set the gemset and ruby version for you.</p>
