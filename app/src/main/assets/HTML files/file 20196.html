<blockquote>
  <p>Tie the generated license to individual's machine using machine unique
  identifier such as computer SID, HDD serial number, CPU Identifier,
  etc. Use float licenses and check the availability of the license on
  the server at runtime. Rhino Licensing provides necessary
  infrastructure for you to achieve this. Rhino Licensing can also
  include custom data in the license file so you have the ability to
  easily store your customer information in the license file. With all
  these said, having a licensing scheme on your application does not
  mean you are completely safe. Hackers and crackers try to reverse
  engineer your application code to see how the licensing is done, so
  you make look into other security concerns and it is advised to use an
  obfuscation tool to make this harder for malicious users.</p>
