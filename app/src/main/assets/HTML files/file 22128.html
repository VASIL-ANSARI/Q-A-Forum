<p>Try calling glViewport() function at the very beginning of the QTWindow::resizeGL() function:</p>

<pre><code>glViewport(0, 0, width, height);
</code></pre>

<p>And don't ever call resizeGL() with <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> set to 0 ;) Besides that, it is not necessary for you to call resizeGL() directly as it is being called by Qt whenever the window is being resized.</p>

<p>You can remove all calls to the swapBuffers() function - it is being called internally by Qt.</p>

<p>The makeCurrent() function should be called before all other GL calls, so it is good that you have called it in initializeGL(), but you don't have to call it in the paintGL() function (unless paintGL() is being called from another thread, but I bet it isn't in your code). </p>
