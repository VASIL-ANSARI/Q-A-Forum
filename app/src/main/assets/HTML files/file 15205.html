<p>I finally got this fixed. I used the shell script to check for whites pace as well as manually eyeballing through my entire app. From models down to my views. </p>

<p>Cleaned up the entire code and made sure there wasn't any unnecessary whitespace or unused methods such as debug and it's working fine now. I guess clean coding does help in getting your app run smoothly.</p>
