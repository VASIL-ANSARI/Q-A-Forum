<p>I have been using <a href="http://www.fusioncharts.com/javascript-chart-fiddles/?type=Combination--Charts" rel="nofollow">Fusioncharts</a> and have tried their Combination Charts many times, which has been very useful for displaying different data in a particular chart. Coming up to your issue Bar Chart is basically the horizontal bars in the charts, their data in the x-axis depends on the values of the bars, and when coming to Spline chart the data of the y-axis depends on the value of the line been created. </p>

<p>According to me it would be better if you try out a different Combination Charts, where <a href="http://www.fusioncharts.com/javascript-chart-fiddles/?type=Combination--Charts" rel="nofollow"><strong>FusionCharts</strong></a> have many options.</p>
