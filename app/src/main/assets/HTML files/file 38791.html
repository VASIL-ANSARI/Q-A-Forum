<blockquote>
  <p>An interface is an abstract class (in languages like Java where there
  is no multiple inheritance, sometimes there are other restrictions,
  such as a separate data type) that is intended to be used as a common
  base to access a number of similarly-behaving objects. Conceptually,
  there is no requirement for abstractness, but usually, an interface
  will have at least one abstract method. An interface is a method for
  your program to communicate with a number of similar classes, each
  with different semantics but the same general purpose.</p>

<p>An interface provides no functional benefit, but it does provide you with the guarantee that any inheriting classes will at least have some amount of commonality.</p>
