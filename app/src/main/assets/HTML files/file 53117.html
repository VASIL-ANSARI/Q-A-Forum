<p>I suspect that when you are running locally, it is picking up the file on the classpath from an exploded JAR file (i.e. as a regular file on the filesystem).</p>

<p>On Heroku, it is in the JAR file, which means it is not a regular file, and must be read as an input stream, which might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>ClassLoader cl = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
InputStream inputStream = cl.getResourceAsStream(pathToMyFile);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you might use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html" rel="nofollow">BufferedReader</a> to ready the lines. But maybe <code>ResourceUtils</code> has a better method.</p>

<p>You can probably reproduce the problem locally by running the same command that's in your <code>Procfile</code>.</p>
