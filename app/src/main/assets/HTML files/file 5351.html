<p>The comma operator evaluates both, but then overall returns the value of its second operand.  Since <code>stupid()</code> doesn't have any side effects, that means nothing much of use really happens here and you're overall just checking to see if <code>i&lt;10</code>.</p>

<p>When you change it to <code>&amp;&amp;</code> then both functions must return true (non-zero) for the iteration to continue.  On the first pass through on which the statement evaluates to false the <code>for</code> loop halts and control continues past it.</p>
