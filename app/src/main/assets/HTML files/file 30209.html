<p>You seem to be either missing the mysql plugin on your Windows or the proper mysql installation itself in which case you will need to get that done by installing all the necessary mysql libraries on your system where the plugin QtSql driver can recognize it.</p>

<p>The plugin should be available under the plugins/sqldrivers folder as a dll. You could also put it into an sqldrivers folder beside your application, so somethiing like this:</p>

<pre><code>- yourapplication.exe
- sqldrivers/qsqlmysql4.dll
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to grab it somehow, or build it yourself. This is the explanation from the documentation how to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/sql-driver.html#how-to-build-the-qmysql-plugin-on-windows" rel="nofollow">How to Build the QMYSQL Plugin on Windows</a></p>
  
  <p>You need to get the MySQL installation files. Run SETUP.EXE and choose "Custom Install". Install the "Libs &amp; Include Files" Module. Build the plugin as follows (here it is assumed that MySQL is installed in C:\MySQL):</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd %QTDIR%\src\plugins\sqldrivers\mysql
qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\MySQL\include" "LIBS+=C:\MYSQL\MySQL Server &lt;version&gt;\lib\opt\libmysql.lib" mysql.pro
nmake
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are not using a Microsoft compiler, replace nmake with make in the line above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is another problem with your code though. You should be using "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" for mysql databases.</p>
