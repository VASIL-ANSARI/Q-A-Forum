<p>Thank you for explaining the values used for <code>tileSize</code>. The value <strong>0.1</strong> cannot be represented in floating-point at any precision, it degenerates into a repeating fraction in base-2, much like everyone is familiar with 1/3 doing in base-10. Now, if you continue to add this number which is not exactly <strong>0.1</strong> to something, eventually the result will be appreciably different from what you would expect.</p>

<p>In general, it is best to avoid floating-point expressions for loop control. You may think that because the compiler happily accepts a floating-point constant such as <strong>0.1</strong> that all is well and that it can accurately represent that number, but if you do not understand the mechanics of floating-point math then weird things like this can happen.</p>

<p>In case you were curious, a more detailed explanation of the issue I mentioned can be found <a href="http://www.exploringbinary.com/why-0-point-1-does-not-exist-in-floating-point/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
