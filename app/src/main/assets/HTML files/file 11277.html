<p>I guess this should be simpler.. </p>

<pre><code>  int compare(const void *node1, const void *node2) {
      BINARY_ARRAY_RECORD *ptr1 = *(BINARY_ARRAY_RECORD * const *)node1;
      BINARY_ARRAY_RECORD *ptr2 = *(BINARY_ARRAY_RECORD * const *)node2;
      return strcmp(ptr1-&gt;name, ptr2-&gt;name);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And also I think the qsort function call could be definitely right if it were something like this,</p>

<pre><code>qsort(records, 2, sizeof(BINARY_ARRAY_RECORD*), compare);
</code></pre>

<p>I think the third argument must be the size of the structure and you can be definitely be sure if it were something like the above.. </p>
