<p>If you use a compatibility OpenGL context, you don't need a VAO.  In a sense, there is a "default" VAO which is always bound.  This is how it works in OpenGL 2.x, and this is part of what the "compatibility" means in "compatibility profile".</p>

<p>In you use a core OpenGL context, you do need a VAO.  If you don't, your code simply won't work.  If you want to continue pretending you don't need a VAO, you can create a single VAO and have it bound for the entire duration of your program.</p>

<p>The issue of choosing a core vs compatibility profiles has its nuances, but in general it is recommended to request a core profile if you are developing a new program.  Not all systems have great support for compatibility profiles anyway.  Mesa limits compatibility profiles to 3.0 and OS X limits them to 2.1.  If you want a core profile, you have to explicitly request a core profile when you create the context.</p>
