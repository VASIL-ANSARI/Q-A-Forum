<p>You should try this again - DKPY2 (just released) uses stand-alone scripts and is designed with the idea that each Vehicle object returned using the connect() function is completely independent. It is certainly possible to connect to separate vehicles in the same script (same process) so very likely you can connect to the same vehicle and from separate processes.</p>
