<p>The host is either down or very slow to respond. If it's slow to respond, you can try increasing the timeout via the <code>connection_timeout</code> option or via the <code>default_socket_timeout</code> setting and see if that reduces the failures.</p>

<p>You can also include error handling as zanlok pointed out to retry a few times. If you have users actually waiting on these SOAP calls then you'll want to queue them up and process them in the background and notify the user when they're finished.</p>
