<pre><code>strcpy(my_char, my_char+1);
</code></pre>

<p><code>strcpy</code> strings must not overlap.</p>

<p>From the C Standard (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(C99, 7.21.2.3p2) "The strcpy function copies the string pointed to by s2 (including the terminating null character) into the array pointed to by s1. <strong>If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
