<p>If you want to do it on your own, I recommend you to read the chapter <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5" rel="nofollow">Reference Resolution in RFC 3986</a>. It explains how to establish the base URI and how to resolve relative URIs by giving an algorithm.</p>

<p>But thereâs probably already a library in Java that does that for you.</p>
