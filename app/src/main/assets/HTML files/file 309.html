<p>There's the method_missing method. You could implement that in your Application Controller and catch all missing actions, maybe logging those and redirecting to the index action of the relevant controller. This approach would ignore everything that can't be routed to a controller, which is pretty close to what you want. </p>

<p>Alternatively, I'd just log all errors, extract the URL and sort it by # of times it occured.</p>
