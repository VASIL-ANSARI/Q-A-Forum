  should avoid doing anything like this with super globals in any sense.
  You're better off controlling each aspect as best as possible and
  assigning the variables properly, as best practice permits. i.e.</p>

<pre><code>$a = 'derp';
</code></pre>

<p>What you're doing is called <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php" rel="nofollow">Variable Variable</a> and is built into PHP. It essentially allows you to dynamically create variables for use within the current scope.</p>

<p>Take a <code>$_POST</code> array of the following:</p>

<pre><code>Array (
    [a] =&gt; 'derp'
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now with your current code, you'll be dynamically creating &amp; assigning a variable:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($_POST as $post =&gt; $var){
    ${$post} =  $var;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which in turn, allows you to access said variable as the key:</p>

<pre><code>echo $a; // would echo out derp
</code></pre>

<p>From personal experience, this isn't always necessary and an issue you could potentially run into is overwriting a variable that has already been set, in turn, producing unwanted/unexplained output.</p>
