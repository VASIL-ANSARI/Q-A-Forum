<p>I saw the following message in Android developer website:</p>

<p>"This can happen when a process is terminated on the device and ddms attempts
to close its connection to it.</p>

<p>You can safely ignore this exception, this is purely on the ddms side, and
has no impact on your processes running on the device.</p>

<p>The fix has already been implemented and will be part of the next release."</p>
