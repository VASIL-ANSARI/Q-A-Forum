<p>Those variables are managed by your shell. When <code>rake</code> does <code>ENV['verbose']</code> he's just asking the shell, "hey, do you have any value called 'verbose'? If yes, give it to me".</p>

<p>Shells are generally not able to handle hypens in their variable names; like in most programming languages, the hypen is reserved for the substraction operation.</p>

<p>The simplest fix would be replacing the hyphen by an underscore:</p>

<pre><code>rake deploy verbose=true environment=production dry_run=true
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another option would be using something more suited for command line management. <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor" rel="nofollow">thor</a> should allow you to define a command like so:</p>

<pre><code>deploy --verbose --environment=production --dry-run
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>It turns out that the values are passed verbatim to rake, not handled by the shell as I thought - see first comment on this answer for details. The solutions proposed on this answer work nevertheless.</p>
