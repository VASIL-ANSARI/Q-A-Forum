<p>I am new here and I am not sure if this is a good practice but I will post my observation and not a precise solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The same problem appears on Opera.</p></li>
<li><p>This seemed strange to me - when <code>li:hover a img{ border:1px solid black; }</code> or any similar css code that is not supposed to make any change to the current situation is added it all starts to behave very strange. ex - <a href="http://jsbin.com/operib/43/edit" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/operib/43/edit</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>And here it is the solution I do not find elegant, just a quick fix:
<a href="http://jsbin.com/operib/39/edit" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/operib/39/edit</a></p>

<p>EDIT: After testing @Carol McKay's result I realized that the transition is making the whole mess. The next link (node 58) is node 43 linked above (which is basically node 1 just added border to the image on hover) with removed transition and it works just fine  <a href="http://jsbin.com/operib/58/edit" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/operib/58/edit</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that any css rule should be added on hover so the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> dimensions are recalculated.</p>
