<pre><code>ALTER TABLE table
 CHANGE COLUMN old_col_name
 new_col_name column_definition;
</code></pre>

<p>This changes the column name without losing the data in the column (unless you change the data type as well and the new data type is smaller than the old data type, e.g. changing BIGINT to SMALLINT).</p>

<p>This command unfortunately requires that you repeat the current definition of the column, e.g. data type, NOT NULL, and other options.  There is no command in MySQL to simply rename a column.</p>

<p>The CHANGE COLUMN clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL, which provides no syntax to rename a column in place.  </p>

<p>Another solution if you want to stick to standard SQL is to add a new column, copy the data from the old column to the new column, and then drop the old column:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN new_col_name column_definition;

UPDATE table SET new_col_name = old_col_name;

ALTER TABLE table DROP COLUMN old_col_name;
</code></pre>
