<p>This is a late answer but I recently ran into a similar problem. I needed to filter through a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and filter out emojis that couldn't be rendered on the device (i.e., if the device was old and didn't support rendering them).</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was using <code>Paint</code> to measure the text width.</p>

<pre><code>Paint mPaint = new Paint();
private boolean emojiRenderable(String emoji) {
    float width = mPaint.measureText(emoji);
    if (width &gt; 7) return true;
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>width &gt; 7</code> part is particularly hacky, I would expect the value to be <code>0.0</code> for non-renderable emoji, but across a few devices, I found that the value actually ranged around <code>3.0</code> to <code>6.0</code> for non-renderable, and <code>12.0</code> to <code>15.0</code> for renderable. Your results may vary so you might want to test that. I believe the font size also has an effect on the output of <code>measureText()</code> so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Overall I am not sure if this is a great solution but it's the best that I've come up with so far.</p>
