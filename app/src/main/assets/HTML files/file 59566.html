<p>Define a bean in your local java config with the same name and type as the one inherited in the spring.xml file. </p>

<p>Annotate your bean with <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Primary.html" rel="nofollow">@Primary</a> which will make yours used over the imported one.</p>

<p>Your application will still use the definitions of all the other beans you inherit. </p>

<p>To prevent other defined beans loading that you do not actually need you have to change the bean creation to <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Lazy.html" rel="nofollow">lazy</a> configuration, that is, they only get created when explicitly used. </p>

<p>To do this in your main Spring boot class where the application is created, most likely annotated with <code>@SpringBootApplication/ @Configuration/ @EnableAutoConfiguration/ @ComponentScan</code> you should add <code>@Lazy</code> above it.</p>

<p>Usually you would explicitly annotate the Bean in question but here it cannot be done as it is originating in a spring.xml file in a 3rd party jar. The idea here is to cleanly state all beans are lazy from the highest point in the spring configuration.</p>
