<p>There is no problem in using AsyncTask like this. You don't have to use <code>doInBackground</code> return value. Concerning second question, yes <code>onPostExecute</code> will be called even in case of exception. If you don't want to call it, you would have to use <code>MyAsyncTask.cancel(true)</code></p>
