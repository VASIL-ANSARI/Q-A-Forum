<p>Maybe you're looking at it wrong. Why not make the delegate for the textField be the cell itself, ie, in the Cell's class, set the delegate to File'sOwner or self in the init... method.</p>

<p>Create a reference to the dataSource and pass the dataSource to your cell, along with the @"Key" for your dictionary.  </p>

<pre><code>cell.dataSource = self.dictionary;
cell.dataKey = @"Tastenote";
//in cell .m
//textFieldDelegate method...
[self.dataSource setObject:self.cellTextView.text forKey:self.dataKey];
</code></pre>
