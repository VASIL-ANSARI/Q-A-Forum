<p><code>GridLayout</code> I've never actually used but I'm not sure if it can do this.</p>

<p><code>BorderLayout</code> can do this and is simpler to use than <code>GridBagLayout</code>.</p>

<p><code>GridBagLayout</code> can do this.</p>

<p>In general <code>GridBagLayout</code> is one of the most flexible <code>LayoutManager</code>s and is well worth learning so I'd recommend using it here to get used to it on a simple case before you need it anyway for something more complex.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with HTML then think of <code>GridBagLayout</code> as working like HTML tables.</p>

<p>Very quickly - create the three panels and set the sizes/borders/whatever you need in them.</p>

<p>Add one in cell 0,0 with a colspan of 2.
Add one in cell 1,0
Add one in cell 1,1</p>

<p>After that you are done although you will probably want to specify resize/anchor/etc behaviour.</p>
