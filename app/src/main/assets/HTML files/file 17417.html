<p>Version 2.1 (the latest) still stores the files in the same location but solves the problem of files getting deleted. For iOS 5.1 it takes a backup of the database. For iOS 6 it sets a property that tells iOS to keep the databases and web content.</p>

<p>Until the next release you probably want to get the latest source from GitHub since the 2.1 release has a small bug where localStorage data is not persisted the first time you run the application. From the second time onwards everything is fine.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>This bug <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-330" rel="nofollow">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-330</a> talks about the issue in 5.1 and how PhoneGap work around it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT AGAIN</strong></p>

<p>This bug <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-1535" rel="nofollow">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-1535</a> details the code fix required to make localStorage data persist from the first install on iOS 6.</p>
