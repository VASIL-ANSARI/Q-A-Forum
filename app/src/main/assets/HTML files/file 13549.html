<p><strong>KISS solution:</strong>  If there are only a few number of pages and there really is no logic in the .aspx pages, you could always just load all of the possible web pages, and save them as .html pages via the browser functionality.  Google Chrome allows you to right-click on each page and choose <strong>Save as...</strong>  Internet Explorer &amp; Firefox have similar functionality.  These pages that you save can then be uploaded to your Go-Daddy site.</p>
