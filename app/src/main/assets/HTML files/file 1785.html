<p>There are two different ways of indexing ListView items, by position in the adapter, or by visible place on the screen. An item will always be at the same position within the adapter (unless you alter the list). The index into view.getChildAt() will vary depending on what is visible on the screen. </p>

<p>The position being returned by pointToPosition is the position within the adapter.  If you want to get the physical view, you need to account for if the view is scrolled. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>int adapterIndex = MainActivity.this.getListView().pointToPosition((int) e1.getX(),(int) e1.getY());
int firstViewItemIndex = MainActivity.this.getListView().getFirstVisiblePosition();
int viewIndex = adapterIndex - firstViewItemIndex;
View v = MainActivity.this.getListView().getChildAt(viewIndex);
</code></pre>
