<p>Describe is used to explain what is being worked on. Typically you're going to describe a class and it's going to surround all of the <code>it</code> calls. <code>it</code> is the test case(s) that is/are executed within the <code>describe</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>describe Foo do
  it "will return true" do
    expect(Foo.bar).to eq(true)
  end

  it "will return false" do
    expect(Foo.baz).to eq(false)
  end
end

# When run, rspec output is:
Foo
  will return true
  will return false
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case, the <code>it</code> method is describing how <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> will function on the <code>Foo</code> class. <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/example-groups/basic-structure-describe-it" rel="nofollow">A good read is the rspec documentation on this.</a></p>
