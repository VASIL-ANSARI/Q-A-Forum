<p>As a concept, change <strong>coins_so_far</strong> to <strong>coins_this_call</strong>.</p>

<p>Your recursion steps change to something of this ilk; although it's not complete, I hope you see the idea.</p>

<pre><code>for c in change(n-sum(coins_this_call), coins_available[:]):
    yield coins_this_call.append(c)
</code></pre>

<p>You locally keep the count of coins at the current denomination -- don't pass the whole load through the recursions.  When you recur, instead of passing the original amount as well as the coins already used, simply pass the <em>remaining</em> problem.  When that returns with solutions, append the current level's solution, returning the augmented list to whatever called <em>this</em> instance.</p>

<p>Is that enough hint to get you moving?</p>
