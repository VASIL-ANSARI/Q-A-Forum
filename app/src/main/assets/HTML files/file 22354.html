<p>Please confirm, but I am guessing from reading farther that scrolling rows out of view would result in the same problem, so on textFieldDidEndEditing as well as possibly on each insert in my case, needs to be handled to store "new" data in the corresponding entry of the Data storage array for each row. 
However, in my case without scroll I would probably need to do:
 - (void)reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:(NSArray *)indexPaths withRowAnimat....
for all rows in the section being modified and possibly all visible rows. Confirmation are greatly appreciated.</p>
