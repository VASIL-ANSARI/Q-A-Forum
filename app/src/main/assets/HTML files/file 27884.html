<p>Since IOS 5 you have <em>ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)</em> which is automatically releasing the object correctly. Anyway you are not allocating the memory for the <code>mySecondClasss</code> class. Not sure why it even worked in the first method.</p>

<p>Instead of using</p>

<pre><code>mySecondClasss *second = [[mySecondClasss init] autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>Try using</p>

<pre><code>mySecondClasss *second = [[mySecondClasss alloc] init];
</code></pre>
