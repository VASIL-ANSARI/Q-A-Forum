<p>Add the moment.js library to your project. If the p.myDate is a date string, and you want a date object, try using this.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; $scope.yourArray.length; i++) {
   if(moment($scope.yourArray[i].myDate).isValid()) {
     //if you want to keep the date string
     //$scope.yourArray[i].myDateString = $scope.yourArray[i].myDate;
     $scope.yourArray[i].myDate = new Date(moment($scope.yourArray[i].myDate));
   }
   else {
     console.log("not a valid date", $scope.yourArray[i].myDate);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If there are no spaces, / or - between YYYY, MM and DD you should reformat the string. Let me know if this is the case and you need help with that. </p>
