<p><strong>There are some way to do this</strong>, seem you want <strong>find a word</strong> and not a part of a word, so you can do in easy way with <code>like operator</code></p>

<p>You can have 3 cases to found a word</p>

<ol>
<li>'space'WORD </li>
<li>WORD'space'</li>
<li>'space'WORD'space'</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE Field like ' an' OR Field like 'an ' OR
  Field like ' an '</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope it helps</p>
