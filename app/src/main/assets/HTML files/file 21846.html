<p>The error message</p>

<pre><code>No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Means that the current directory does not contain files names <code>"TabletFilter.sys"</code> or <code>"TabletFilter.sys.old"</code>.</p>

<p>What you can do is either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Specify the full path to the file.</li>
<li>Ensure that the current directory, when your code executes, is the directory that contains your file.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, even when you do this, your program may very well fail. You may not have sufficient rights to modify the contents of that folder. And the file you are trying to rename may well be locked if the OS has loaded the driver. </p>

<p>And as @Hans points out, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/aa384187.aspx" rel="nofollow">file system redirector</a> could very well be confounding matters for you. The best way to avoid that is to us a 64 bit process.</p>

<p>I see no reason for using a C++ program here. Renaming files is a task best suited to a scripting language.</p>
