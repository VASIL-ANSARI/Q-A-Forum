<p>Like some other crypto systems, Paillier key generation starts out by picking two large primes <code>p,q</code> and setting <code>n=p*q</code>. Since messages have to be in <code>Z/nZ</code> (this denotes integeres modulo n), it is indeed correct that if you choose a 1024-bit implementation (i.e., <code>n</code> has 1024 bits), you can't encode messages larger than 1024 bits in a single step.</p>

<p>However, nothing prevents you from splitting your larger message into many smaller blocks and encrypting every block individually. In your case, the state of the first 32 radios would forn the first block, which you then encrypt and send. Repeat for the state of radios 33-64, etc etc etc. </p>
