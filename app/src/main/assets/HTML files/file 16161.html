<ol>
<li>In most cases // will be same as /.</li>
<li><p>'.' means current directory and '..' means parent directory.</p>

<p>/app/test/files/somefile.php,
  /app/test/files/another.php,
  /app/test/css/somecss.css</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to access somecss.css inside somefile.php and you don't know the absolute path from root of the application then you write.</p>

<p>../css/somecss.css -> Go to parent folder test then css folder and finally somecss.css file</p>

<p>Similarly if you want to access another.php you write</p>

<p>./another.php or simply another.php</p>
