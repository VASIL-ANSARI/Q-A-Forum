<p>You can get all the answers to your questions in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/uiview_class/uiview/uiview.html" rel="nofollow">UIView Class Reference</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q1</strong>: <code>ShowHideView</code>, as you have it, is not a method at all. It is simply an "application-supplied identifier for the animations". In reality, you don't need it. When I use this method, I just use <code>NULL</code> instead of supplying an identifier there.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong>: You don't set animations in the <code>beginAnimations:context:</code> call. You even illustrate it there by calling <code>setAnimationCurve</code>. You can set the animations from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/uiview_class/uiview/uiview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006816-CH3-SW65" rel="nofollow">this <code>typedef</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q3</strong>: Again, you don't declare animation types in <code>animateWithDuration:animations:</code> call either. Utilize <code>setAnimationCurve:</code> to do that in that example as well.</p>
