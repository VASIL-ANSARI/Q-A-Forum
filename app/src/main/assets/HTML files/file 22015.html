<p>You can't! The YAML you posted results in a dict containing just a single key, <code>a</code> which maps to the value <code>"b:x test2 test test3"</code> - you can easily test that by <a href="http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">pasting your YAML here</a>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that you cannot mix <code>key: value</code> pairs and keyless items (like there would be in an array).</p>

<p>However, let's assume that you have proper YAML that contains an object <code>a</code> containing another object that maps <code>b</code> to <code>x</code>. For example this:</p>

<pre><code>a:
    b: x
    c: test2
    d: test
    e: test3
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you'd use <code>foo['a']['b']</code> to access <code>x</code> with <code>foo</code> being the object returned by your YAML parser.</p>

<p>The python code to get <code>foo</code> could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>import yaml
with open('yourfile.yaml') as f:
    foo = yaml.safe_load(f)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using <code>safe_load</code> since you most likely do not intend to create arbitrary Python objects from your YAML document and thus you want to use a function that cannot open a security hole if ever passed a malicious YAML document.</p>
