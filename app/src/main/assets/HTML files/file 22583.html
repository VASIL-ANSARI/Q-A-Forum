<p>The problem description is incomplete (essential CSS missing etc.), but the main problem seems to be that you are setting left margin on an inline element. With the given markup, the following CSS modifications render it in a way that seems to be roughly what is meant:</p>

<pre><code>.comment_info {
  display: block;
  margin-left: 0px;
  color: #767676;
  /* margin-left:-20px; NOT set here */
}
#comment_content {
  margin-left: 90px;
  display: block;
}
.span2 { 
  width: 80px; 
  height: 35px; 
  float: left;
  border: solid 1px red;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>It would be more logical to use a <code>div</code> element and not <code>span</code> for the comment content; doing so, you could drop the <code>display: block</code> declaration.</p>

<p>P.S. You shouldnât really use <code>aside</code> here; itâs not meant for purposes like this, and it just confuses some old browsers; use <code>div</code> instead.</p>
