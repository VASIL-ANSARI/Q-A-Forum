<p>The simplest way to have unspecified number of rows in a grid is to use <code>GridLayout</code> with 0 as the row count:</p>

<pre><code>setLayout(new GridLayout(0, 2));
</code></pre>

<p>This will result in 2 columns, and rows being added as needed. The downside of <code>GridLayout</code> is that the labels and text fields  will have the same width, which may not be what you want.</p>

<p>Another easy approach is nesting layouts: you could place each label + text field combination to a JPanel, and then continue adding those panels to a vertical <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/box.html" rel="nofollow">BoxLayout</a> as needed. This neither, is flawless, and can result in a layout like:</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>label | text
-----------------
long label | text
</code></pre>

<p>If you need a grid that can make the columns and rows different width, investigate other grid based layouts: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html" rel="nofollow">GridBagLayout</a> comes with the standard library, and is capable of such grids, but is a bit complicated to use. If you find yourself making a lot of such layouts, consider using a third party layout manager, such as <a href="http://www.miglayout.com/" rel="nofollow">MiGLayout</a>.</p>
