<p>Add a comment to the class definition to remind you that you have to tweak the serializer when adding members. There are limits on what a computer could do for you -- that's why code review is important. Let any patches be reviewed by another programmer, have a rigorous set of test cases and hope for the best.</p>

<p>I'm sure you could e.g. write a clang plugin which will make sure that a particular method references every member of a struct, but do you really <em>need</em> this and can you invest your time into that?</p>

<p>That said, you have bonus points for trying to offload as much work to the computer as possible. Even the <code>static_assert</code> trick is a good one. If you protect it with a set of <code>#ifdef</code>s for one particular ABI and architecture where you build often enough, it might do a great job.</p>
