<p>You cannot add a read-write store that is in the bundle. The bundle is read only.</p>

<p>Instead, copy the sqlite file to the documents directory first and use that URL to add the store to the store coordinator.</p>

<p>I do not think that journal_mode "delete" and <code>NSReadOnlyPersistentStoreOption</code> are compatible. (Does not seem to make any sense, anyway.) Maybe a journal_mode "off" or no journal_mode option would be more promising.</p>
