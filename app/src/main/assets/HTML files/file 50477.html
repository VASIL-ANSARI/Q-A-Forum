<p>First, the obvious variable naming errors: <code>Matrix</code> is not defined.  You probably meant <code>list</code>, or you meant to name the function argument as <code>Matrix</code>. Btw <code>list</code> is not a good variable name to have, as there is Python data type <code>list</code>.  Also <code>Matrix</code> isn't a good name either, as it's good practice to have variable names lowercase.  Also, <code>srtd</code> is not defined.</p>

<p>Once you correct the naming errors, then the next problem is <code>sorted(xyz)</code> does not modify <code>xyz</code>, but returns a sorted copy of <code>xyz</code>.  So you need to assign it to something.  Well, don't assign it back to <code>Matrix[lineindex]</code>, because then the function will have the undesirable side effect of changing the input matrix passed to it.</p>
