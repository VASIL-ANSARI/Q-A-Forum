<p>You have to cast because the language definition says you have to cast.  Redundant?  Maybe.  But that's the way it is.</p>

<p>For your <code>switch</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>switch (IntTest)
{
    case (int)Test.TestValue1: DoSomething(); break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Enum values must be fully qualified with the name of the enum type.</p>
