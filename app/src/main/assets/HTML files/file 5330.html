<p>That is not how you read a file from the internet. Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>String imagePath = "http://duke.kenai.com/misc/Bullfight.jpg";
Image image = null;

try 
{
    URL url = new URL(imagePath);
    image = ImageIO.read(url);
} 
catch (IOException e) 
{
     System.out.println(e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can still use </p>

<pre><code>new ImageIcon(new URL(...));
</code></pre>

<p>But a String does not become a URL just because it starts with "http".</p>
