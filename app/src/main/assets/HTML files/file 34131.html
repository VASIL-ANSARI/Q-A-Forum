<p>Ok i finally managed to make it work better, i'm still not fully understanding how the manifest intent filters are supposed to work, but here is what i did:</p>

<p><strong>Intent intercept app</strong> showed me the mimetype of my files: "text/plain" so first i did is to add: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;data android:mimeType="text/plain" &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, at this point, my App is not showing for every files anymore.</p>

<p>Then, when i'm creating the file, i added: <code>sendIntent.setType("application/custom");</code>
and i added in manifest file the corresponding mimetype.</p>

<p>This way worked good on both Android 2 and 4 phones i tested.</p>

<p>If someone found or wrote something about how intent-filter is exactly working, please let me know !</p>
