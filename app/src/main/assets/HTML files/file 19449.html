<p>I found a comment to a different question which seems to have answered this.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10878695/how-to-read-a-table-in-a-pdf-using-itext-java#comment14421183_10878783">How to read a Table in a PDF using iText java?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can extract text from a content stream, but for ordinary PDFs, the result will be plain text (without any structure). If there's a table on the page, that table won't be recognized as such. You'll get the content and some white space, but that's not a tabular structure! Only if you have a tagged PDF, you can obtain an XML-file. If the PDF contains tags that are recognized as table tags, this will be reflected in the PDF.</p>
