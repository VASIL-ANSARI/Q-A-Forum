<p>you are adding your fragment to your sliding tab view. you wrote :</p>

<pre><code>fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.sliding_tabs, restaurantsFragment);
</code></pre>

<p>tab layout is a child of horizontal scrollview see documentation:    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TabLayout.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TabLayout.html</a></p>

<p>i dont know how your application works but you cant add your fragment to TabLayout here cause it makes multiple children for that that is now allowed (TabLaout is actually a horizontal scrollView inside)</p>

<p>in <code>fragmentTransaction.replace()</code> method that i mentioned you must specify the container in which you want to add the fragment. from what your code says you are using the tabLayput for title of your viewpager not for replacing your fragment in it.</p>

<p>make a place (container) in your main activity in which you want to add your fragment in. absolutely its not in your <code>R.id.sliding_tabs,</code> beside your titles of viewpager.</p>
