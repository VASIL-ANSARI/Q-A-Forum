<p>Because <code>.</code> will match one character, and in this case you have <code>'ro'</code> and  <code>', '</code> which are followed by one <code>b</code>. And with regards to this point that <code>finall()</code> function doesn't match overlapped patterns if you want to match such patterns, you can use a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html" rel="nofollow">positive look ahead</a> and put your pattern in a capture group :</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = re.findall('(?=(..b))', line)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
['rob', 'obb', ', b']
</code></pre>
