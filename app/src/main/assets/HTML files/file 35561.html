<p>I think you're looking for <a href="https://github.com/dciccale/grunt-processhtml" rel="nofollow">grunt-Process HTML</a> and its rather smashing <a href="https://github.com/dciccale/grunt-processhtml#buildincludetargets-value" rel="nofollow">include subtask</a>.</p>

<p>In your index.html file you can include... includes. :)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- build:include my-styles.min.css --&gt;
This will be replaced by the content of my-styles.min.css
&lt;!-- /build --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work for you, a simple bash script that concats the minified versions could also be run with <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-run" rel="nofollow">Grunt-Run</a>.</p>
