<p>You appear to be <strong>starting</strong> a network request when your app goes to the background.  This means, for example, that when the user closes the app, you begin making a network transaction.  That's not the way Apple intends for apps to work (<em>ideally</em>).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/applicationDidEnterBackground" rel="nofollow">the documentation on applicationDidEnterBackground:</a> (bold is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your implementation of this method <strong>has approximately five seconds to
  perform any tasks and return</strong>. If you need additional time to perform
  any final tasks, you can request additional execution time from the
  system by calling beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:. In
  practice, you should return from applicationDidEnterBackground: as
  quickly as possible. If the method does not return before time runs
  out your application is terminated and purged from memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you're probably seeing that your network transaction is not always finishing quickly enough.</p>

<p>I'd recommend rethinking your app.  <code>applicationDidEnterBackground:</code> is probably not the right time to do this work.  If you really need to do some work in the background, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/10319643/119114">this example</a> of using a background <em>task</em>.  If you put your code in a background task, then you should be able to use <code>NSURLConnection</code> either with a synchronous, <strong>or</strong> asynchronous request.</p>
