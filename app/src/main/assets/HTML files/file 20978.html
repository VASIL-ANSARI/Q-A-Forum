<p>Don't use COM ports. Yuk! :-)</p>

<p>Instead use Sockets or a Bluetooth API, then you can accept lots and lots of connections to the same Bluetooth 'server'.  For instance my library <a href="http://32feet.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">32feet.NET</a>.</p>

<p>See e.g. <a href="http://32feet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Bluetooth%20Server-side" rel="nofollow">32feet.NET docs -- Bluetooth%20Server-side</a></p>

<p>However. If you mean one client device (eg Android here) connecting to one server device then there is a restriction. With RFComm, as used by SPP, there can be only one connection from one device to the same server application. To get two connections between two device then there will need to be two RFComm/SPP servers running.</p>
