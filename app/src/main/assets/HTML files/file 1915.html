<p>How are you allocating things on the heap?</p>

<p>If you're allocating managed objects (<code>gcnew</code> etc) and then passing those to unmanaged code, or simply passing pointers to existing managed objects into unmanaged code, then the garbage collector comes along and collects or relocates them. This causes your unmanaged code to have garbage pointers, hence (most probably) the access violation</p>

<p>We'd almost definitely need to see a code snippet in order to give much more help. Cheers</p>
