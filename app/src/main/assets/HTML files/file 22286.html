<p>It's not clear what ResetPasswordEmailContents.aspx does.</p>

<p>I'd use <a href="http://www.intstrings.com/ramivemula/articles/how-to-send-an-email-using-c-net-with-complete-features/" rel="nofollow">SmtpClient</a> to send the message. I also wrote a post on <a href="http://www.leghumped.com/2012/12/28/templating-with-spark-and-wpf/" rel="nofollow">templating with the Spark view engine from a WPF app/windows service</a> which may help you.</p>
