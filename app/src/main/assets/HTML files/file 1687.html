<p>I think there is a certain confusion here. The main reason that you cannot interact with this information and for the lack of API is because none of these things (reviews, photos, videos, other content) is actually owned by Google. Google just indexes and aggregates information from the sites like Qype, ViewLondon, etc. It is a catalogue of sorts to get an overview and explore certain aspects further.</p>
