<p>It's a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html" rel="nofollow">for-each loop</a>, introduced in Java 1.5.</p>

<p>You can read it as "For each <code>Some</code> in <code>vc</code>".</p>

<p>It's effectively the same as using an iterator like so:</p>

<pre><code>for(Iterator&lt;Some&gt; i = vc.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
  Some obj = i.next();
  System.out.println(obj.getResult());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Only with less bloat.</p>

<p>Also, note that this syntax isn't limited to things that are <code>Iterable</code>.  This would also work if <code>vc</code> were an array of <code>Some</code> (i.e. <code>Some[]</code>).</p>
