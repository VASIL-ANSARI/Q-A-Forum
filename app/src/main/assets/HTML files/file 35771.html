<p>My name's Edwin with the Leap Motion Community Team. Unfortunately the "point clouds" that were featured in our early videos are visualizations from some of our debugging tools. Because theyâre not temporally or spatially consistent, they are not usable as methods of interaction. There is currently no point cloud to be had. It may be something we can reconstruct from the 3D information we do have, but probably not a feature we will add in the short term.</p>
