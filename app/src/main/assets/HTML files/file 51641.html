  <p>...but when gujarati has been broken into more than one string</p>

<p>When a text message exceeds the maximum message length (which depends on the character set you're using), it can be broken up into parts, and sent as a multipart message. That's what's happening in your case, and the way you've structured your code, it appears like you're receiving several different texts. The following code is an example of how to get the full message, as well as the originating number and timestamp.</p>

<pre><code>final Object[] pdusObj = (Object[]) bundle.get("pdus");
if (pdusObj.length == 0)
    return;

SmsMessage msg = null;
StringBuilder body = new StringBuilder();

for (int i=0; i &lt; pdusObj.length; i++) {
    msg = SmsMessage.createFromPdu((byte[])pdusObj[i]);
    body.append(msg.getDisplayMessageBody().toString());
}

String report = "SMS from " + msg.getDisplayOriginatingAddress()
                + " : " + body.toString();

long smsReceiveTime = msg.getTimestampMillis();
</code></pre>
