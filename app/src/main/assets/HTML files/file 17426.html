<p>I'm not sure if this is guaranteed across all ECMAScript implementations or not, but the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf" rel="nofollow">Mozilla documentation</a> states that it uses strict equality to make the comparison (===). As such this would exhibit the behaviour you describe, comparing by values on primitives, but by reference on objects (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Using_the_Equality_Operators" rel="nofollow">strict equality</a>).</p>
