<p>The first issue is due to your importing jQuery again at the bottom (as others have already mentioned).
So, remove the last jQuery import.</p>

<p>The main issue is that <code>scope.items</code> is undefined, so you never get inside the <code>if</code> and thus <code>popOverContent</code> remains undefined.
You probably mean to use: </p>

<pre><code>...
$scope: {
    items: '@',
    ...
}
</code></pre>

Not directly related to the question, but here is a <strong><a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/dlL3Lb6GFMVs1QTh0aHC?p=preview" rel="nofollow">modified implementation</a></strong> of the <code>popOver</code> directive. I have changed it a bit (to make it working with as little changes as possible), e.g. it doesn't have an isolate scope any more, it doesn't use a fixed template etc.<br>
The buttons are working as expected.
