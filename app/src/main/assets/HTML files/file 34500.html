<p>You have a problem of joining along two different dimensions, so the rows are multiplying.  You can solve this by pre-aggregating the data.  The following will fix this particular problem:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.*,
       (SUM(a.amount) + c.cnt) as accurred_fees
FROM practices p INNER JOIN
     adjustments a
     ON a.practice_id = p.id INNER JOIN
     (SELECT practice_id, count(*) as cnt
      FROM claims c
      GROUP BY practice_id
     ) c
     ON c.practice_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id;
</code></pre>

<p>You should probably preaggregate the adjustments as well:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.*,
       (a.amount + c.cnt) as accurred_fees
FROM practices p INNER JOIN
     (SELECT practice_id, SUM(amount) as amount
      FROM adjustments a
      GROUP BY practice_id
     ) a
     ON a.practice_id = p.id INNER JOIN
     (SELECT practice_id, count(*) as cnt
      FROM claims c
      GROUP BY practice_id
     ) c
     ON c.practice_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id;
</code></pre>

<p>And you might want to consider <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> rather than <code>INNER JOIN</code> so you get all practices, even those that might be missing adjustments or claims.</p>
