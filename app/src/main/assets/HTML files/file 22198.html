<p>Use a <code>ServerSocket</code> (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html</a>) to listen on port 80. </p>

<p>If a request comes in, <code>accept()</code> it and use the resulting <code>Socket</code>'s <code>getInputStream()</code> and <code>getOutputStream()</code> methods to grab stream objects to handle the data transfer with.</p>

<p>Then just parse out the request coming in on the <code>InputStream</code> and send your reply (<strong>including HTTP headers!!!</strong>) through the <code>OutputStream</code>. Then, close the connection and you're done.</p>

<p>If you need to write a server that can actually handle many simultaneous requests without taking a performance hit, you should definitely check out Java's NIO framework. Do <strong>not</strong> use one Thread per connection, if scalable performance is an issue.</p>
