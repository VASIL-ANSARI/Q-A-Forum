<p>You need to be very clear about the localisation of your bricks.
I suggest adding a UpperLeft property to your Brick class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Brick
{
    /* your other properties here */

    public Point UpperLeft {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure UpperLeft value is properly set to the coordinates of the upper left corner of your brick.
My assumption is that your X and Y follow the standard computer image representation where 0,0 is the top left corner of the image and y increases when you go south (which is different from the usual mathematical standard).
Then your collision check will be:</p>

<pre><code>Point ballRelativeToBrick1 = new Point(
    ballX - picBrick1.UpperLeft.X,
    ballY - picBrick1.UpperLeft.Y)
bool collide = 0 &lt; ballRelativeToBrick1.X &amp;&amp; ballRelativeToBrick1.X &lt; picBrick1.Width
    &amp;&amp; 0 &lt; ballRelativeToBrick.Y &amp;&amp; ballRelativeToBrick.Y &lt; picBrick1.Height
</code></pre>
