<p>I'm not really sure what you're trying to accomplish in the end, but <code>file_exists()</code> generally checks an absolute path in the root filesystem of the machine the webserver is running on, while you seem to try to check a path relative to the root directoty of the webserver (which is a subdirectory of the root filesystem).</p>

<p>You can access this subdirectory in PHP using the predefined variable <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php" rel="nofollow"><code>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']</code></a>.</p>

<p>So something like</p>

<pre><code>if (!file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/featured/JksCreations" . $JKSP)) {
    $JKSP = '/Pages/JKS-404.php';
}
</code></pre>

<p>might work for what you try to do, but it might also still fail due to missing permissions.</p>

<p>Also, be careful what you do with your result, especially in an untrusted environment. You should check that the parameter <code>p</code> only consists of valid characters for a filename (especially no dots and slashes).</p>
