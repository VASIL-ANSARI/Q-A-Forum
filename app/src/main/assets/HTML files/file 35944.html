<p>What I did is change the headerMenu plugin to introduce two features:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new item option, <code>keepOpen</code>, which prevents the menu to close after a command, and</li>
<li>refreshing the item details (specifically <code>iconImage</code> and <code>iconCssClass</code>) after a command (only if the menu was kept open).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try to set up the pull request on the SlickGrid repo if I find the time.</p>
