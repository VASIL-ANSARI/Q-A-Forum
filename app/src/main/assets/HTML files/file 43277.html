  <p>is doing the following the same?</p>

<p>Yes, <code>let foo; if ((foo = bar) === baz)</code> is the same as <code>let foo = bar; if (foo === baz)</code></p>

  <p>In which situations I should assign the value of a variable like in the first example?</p>

<p>When you want to do an amazing one-liner in code golf.</p>

<p>It's only really useful to write it like this very occasionally in the condition of a loop so you don't have to repeat code e.g. consider</p>

<pre><code>foo = bar();
while (false !== foo) {
    // ..
    foo = bar();
}
</code></pre>

<p>vs</p>

<pre><code>while (false !== (foo = bar())) {
    // ..
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing it for an <code>if</code> is just not necessary</p>
