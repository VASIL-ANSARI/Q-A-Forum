<p>You would typically code something like this (pseudo code):</p>

<pre><code>boolean inEventProcessing = false;

processEvent(event){
    if inEventProcessing return
    inEventProcessing = true
    doProcessEvent(event)
    inEventProcessing = false
}
</code></pre>

<p>The alternative is to make sure that by construction no loops happen. This is the conceptual cleaner way, but hard to do if you don't come up with it in the very beginning. One way would be to allow Observers only arguments to the constructors of Observables. This way it would be impossible to construct loops. But it is a extremely rigid structure which probably causes all kinds of different problems. </p>

<p>I do suspect the solution of those problems would lead to a really nice and clean architecture or to a complete and extreme mess, depending on the team working with it.</p>
