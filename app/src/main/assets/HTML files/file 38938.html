<p>I think you are better off specifying in storyboard editor that the textfield
is a phone type and let ios do the checking. One reason for that
is because user will get a better keyboard for text entry,
another is that ios will do it correctly allowing + prefix in addition to digits.</p>

<p>As for the name field I'd won't do any restriction on it if I were you.</p>
