<p>I guess I could stick these in a file with an extension ignored by the formatter and include this file where appropriate.  I tried this out and it works - the data structure gets picked up the indexer (i.e. autocomplete works).  Still, it would be nice to have an equivalent to the Java "@formatter:..." syntax.</p>
