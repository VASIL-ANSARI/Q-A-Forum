<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ty01x675(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">custom deserialization</a> to pull out the field's value by its old name.</p>

<p>Or, make this auto property virtual and derive a class from it. That way you can use <code>base.MyProperty</code> to access the auto-named backing field. You can have a new field in the derived class that is used preferably.</p>
