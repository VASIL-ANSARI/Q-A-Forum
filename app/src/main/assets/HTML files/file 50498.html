<p>I think your problem is that you are trying to set a property on your controller rather than on your controller's <code>$scope</code>.</p>

<p>try</p>

<pre><code>$scope.tomorrow = new Date();
$scope.tomorrow.setDate($scope.tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Remember you'll have to inject <code>$scope</code>!</p>
