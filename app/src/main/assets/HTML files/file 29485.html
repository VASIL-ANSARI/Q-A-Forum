<p>I would strongly advise not forcing IE10 through IE8 to behave as though they are a seriously non-standards-compliant browser from 2001.</p>

<p>But if you really have a case for needing to do that, I expect the venerable (and otherwise-to-be-avoided) <code>document.write</code> could do it for you:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (thisIsIE()) {
    document.write(
        '&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=' +
        thisIsIE11() ? "edge" : "6" +
        '"&gt;'
    );
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can't do that in XHTML.</p>

<p>Alternately, detect server-side and vary what you send back.</p>

<p>And again, really, if you can possibly avoid doing this (and you almost certainly can)...</p>
