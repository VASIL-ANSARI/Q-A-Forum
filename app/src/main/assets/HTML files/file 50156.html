<p>This should be what you need in c#. If you have custom relationships that you want to use, you would just set whatever the relationship schema name is into that Relationship object.  </p>

<pre><code>// Create an object that defines the relationship between the contact and contract.
Relationship relationship = new Relationship("contract_customer_contacts");

//Set up the EntityReferenceCollection that you are associating the contact to
EntityReferenceCollection contractRefs = new EntityReferenceCollection().Add(
    new EntityReference(Contract.EntityLogicalName, _contractId));

//Associate the contact with the contract(s).
_service.Associate(Contact.EntityLogicalName, _contactId, relationship,
contractRefs);
</code></pre>
