<p>No, partials don't call the controller.  You instantiate the objects you need in the controller.  So if you want to render an address partial you'd get the address in the controller.</p>

<p>If you need all 3 on all pages you could create controller concerns which have a before action on them</p>

<pre><code>module GetStuff
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_action :set_user
    before_action :set_address
  end

  def set_user
     @user = # code for getting user
  end
end

class UsersController
  include GetStuff
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or assuming you inherit from application controller you could simply set a before action for them there (but if you have other controllers inheriting from it that's probably not the best idea.</p>

<p>If you use them frequently you could put methods in application controller and set helper methods to allow the methods to be accessible from views as well as controllers.</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController
  def current_user
    @current_user = #code to get user
  end
  helper_method :current_user
end

# Some view
&lt;% if current_user %&gt;
  &lt;%= current_user.username %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could have methods in helpers</p>

<pre><code>module ApplicationHelper
  def current_user
    @current_user = #code to get user
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or presumably address is linked to user too you could create a facade and simply instantiate that in your controllers</p>

<pre><code>class UserController
  def show
    @user_facade = UserFacade.new(User.find(params[:id])
  end
end

class UserFacade
  attr_reader :user

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def address
    @address ||= user.address
  end

  def user_history
    @user_history ||= user.history
  end
end

# users/show.html.erb

&lt;%= render @user_facade.user %&gt;
&lt;%= render @user_facade.address %&gt;
&lt;%= render @user_facade.user_history %&gt;
</code></pre>
