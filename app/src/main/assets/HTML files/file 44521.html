<p>You are passing an argument to your first thread, <code>array</code>, and then immediately overwriting the contents of that struct with the arguments to the second thread.  Both threads will therefore see the arguments for the second thread.</p>

<p>What you should do is have two separate arguments.  For example make <code>array</code> an array of 2 structs and pass <code>&amp;array[0]</code> to the first thread and <code>&amp;array[1]</code> to the second thread.</p>

<p>Also, it is dangerous to declare <code>array</code> in the scope of the for loop.  Once the for loop ends, that variable is out of scope and your threads may read into a dead variable.  You should declare <code>array</code> at the function level so that it remains alive for the threads to access it.</p>
