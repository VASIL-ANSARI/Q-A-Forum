<p>Sreekanth Gundlapalli,</p>

<p>All you need to do is to add the TableView controller's view as subview to your view Controller. In order to simplify the process I personally prefer using the ContainerView,</p>

<p>Step 1 : Add a ContainerView to your View Controller and add the auto layout constraints to it, because your tableView will be loaded inside this container view you donate have to apply any auto layout constraint to your tableView to keep it in place :)</p>

<p>ex :

<p>Step 2 : Drag an IBOutlet to the container view.lets call it as containerView :)</p>

<p>Step 3 : Now its up to you to have two view controller 1 for loading map and 1 for loading tableView, or you will have map view as your view controller subview and you will either hide it or remove it and add container view but I personally prefer having code clean n neat so I prefer having two different VCs</p>

<p>so lets create 2 VCs lets call them as viewController1 &amp; viewController2 Savy ??</p>

<p>Step 4 :
lets write a method which actually loads VC and adds its view as subview to your ViewController</p>

<pre><code>func changeEmbededVC(for status : Int) {
        let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
        if status == 0 {
            mehereButton.tag = 1
            let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "viewController1")
            vc.willMove(toParentViewController: self)
            containerView.addSubview(vc.view)
            self.addChildViewController(vc)
            vc.didMove(toParentViewController: self)
        }
        else {
            mehereButton.tag = 0
            let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "viewController2")
            vc.willMove(toParentViewController: self)
            containerView.addSubview(vc.view)
            self.addChildViewController(vc)
            vc.didMove(toParentViewController: self)
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>I believe code is pretty self explanatory :D now what is <code>mehereButton.tag = 1</code> ?? Simple you want to toggle view on button press don't you :D hence I have created a IBOutlet for mehereButton and changing its tag :)</p>

<p>now finally in IBAction of mehereButton</p>

<pre><code>@IBAction func buttonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    self.changeEmbededVC(for: self.mehereButton.tag)
}
</code></pre>

<p>but we need to load one of the view by default isn't it :D
so change your viewDidAppear to</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    self.changeEmbededVC(for: 0)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope I answered your question In detail :P I know you can't neither up vote or accept answer as you don't have enough reputation :) but hope it will help somebody in future as well :)</p>
