<p>There are a couple things going on here.  First, the ArrowFormat overrides all other classes placed on a cell, so those cells do not have the <code>all-cells</code> class.  This is fine, as long as the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> has the <code>all-cells</code> class.  The <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>'s lose the <code>all-cells</code> class when you deselect them, because <code>all-cells</code> is part of both the even/odd row and selected row classes (and deselecting a row removes whatever classes you put on it.</p>

<p>If the reason you put <code>all-cells</code> as the selected row class is because you don't want the style from the default class, I suggest changing the class to something that has no styles associated with it, like this:</p>

<pre><code>'selectedTableRow': 'noStyle'
</code></pre>

<p>Also, on a side note, you have a typo in the even row classes: there should not be a <code>.</code> before <code>even-background</code>:</p>

<pre><code>'tableRow': 'even-background all-cells'
</code></pre>
