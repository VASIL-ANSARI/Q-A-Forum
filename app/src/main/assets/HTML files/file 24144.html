<p>Equality for a string has been overridden to be based on its value. </p>

<p>The documentation for <code>String.Equals</code> states it checks the value, but that also happens to be what <code>==</code> also does due to the <code>string</code> implementation.</p>

<p><em>Default</em> equality for reference types is based on the reference itself, but that can easily be overridden... so basically your assertion is flawed, as it doesn't take into account types that override default behaviour.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16836028/358221">Jon has stated</a>, reference equality can be forced via the <code>object.ReferenceEquals</code> static method, but as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16835940/358221">Jason has stated</a>, this may also fail if the strings have been interned.</p>

<p><hr/>
According to ILSpy, <code>String.Equals</code> ends up using <code>==</code> at any rate:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Equals(string a, string b)
{
    return a == b || (a != null &amp;&amp; b != null &amp;&amp; a.Length == b.Length &amp;&amp; string.EqualsHelper(a, b));
}
</code></pre>
