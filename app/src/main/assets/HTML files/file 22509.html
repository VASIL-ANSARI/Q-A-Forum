<p>Personally, I prefer your second option.</p>

<p>The issue with the first design is that your effectively adding unnecessary coupling to the design.  Your <code>PullData</code> and <code>PushData</code> methods cannot be used alone - they <em>require</em> that a call to <code>ImportAllData</code> or some other method that will setup and properly cleanup the <code>db</code> variable be called first.</p>

<p>The second option, while <em>slightly</em> more code (though not much), makes the intent very clear for each and every method.  Each method knows that it needs to work on an external <code>DbInterface</code> instance passed into it.  There is little or no chance of this being misused in the future.</p>
