<p>You can have both on the same line. <code>-lz</code> is adding zlib, <code>-ObjC</code> is telling the compiler to load anything that defines an Objective-C class or category. </p>

<p>In XCode, double click on "<em>Other Linker Flags</em>". Assuming its blank (no entryies) click + at the bottom and enter <code>-ObjC</code> (note capitalization). Then click + at the bottom and enter <code>-l"z"</code>. You should have two lines with the two linker flags. </p>

<p>If you have other linker flags in there, its probably OK to leave them, just make sure those two are there!</p>

<p>Another alternative is to integrate the Cast SDK using <a href="https://cocoapods.org/" rel="nofollow">Cocoapods</a> - that will automatically setup the linker flags for you!</p>
