<p>I suspect the answer is in the order of execution. <code>clears out previous DOM elements</code> is <em>very</em> likely to influence the effective scroll position.</p>

<p>Rather than removing and then adding nodes, consider applying a CSS <code>visibility:hidden</code> to all current images, and then swapping them out for the newly loaded images. If there are fewer new than old, remove the stragglers at the end of the function call; if there are more new than old, then continue to add them beyond replacement.</p>

<p>This approach would result in minimal scroll position change.</p>
