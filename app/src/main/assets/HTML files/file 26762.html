<p>You created an array (a holder for several <code>Tablet</code> objects), but you didn't actually create any <code>Tablet</code>s to go inside it. Right now, <code>T</code> (which really should be lowercase; <code>T</code> looks like both a constant and a type parameter) has the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>T: {null, null, null, null, null, null}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to create <code>new Tablet</code>s and put them inside your array, perhaps like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length /* don't hardcode the size twice */; i++) {
    array[i] = new Tablet();
    array[i].set("111");
}
</code></pre>
