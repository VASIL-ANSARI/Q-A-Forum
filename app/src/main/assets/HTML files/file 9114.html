<p>You could use as an alternative  approach the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html" rel="nofollow">Rails Internationalization API</a>. Then you could fill your locale file with the strings you want to use. Any parameter you want to give can be included like in the example ins section 4.2 in the tutorial.</p>

<pre><code>I18n.backend.store_translations :en, :thanks =&gt; 'Thanks %{name}!'
I18n.translate :thanks, :name =&gt; 'Jeremy'
# =&gt; 'Thanks Jeremy!'
</code></pre>

<p>So do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Visit the file <code>config/locales/en.yml</code></p></li>
<li><p>Insert there your localization: </p>

<p>en:
  created: "#{name} has been created!"</p></li>
<li><p>Call instead of <code>notice_message_created(object_name)</code> the following: <code>t(:created, object_name.capitalize)</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>At the end, everything should work as before, you have get rid of a lot of simple methods, and you are able to internationalize your application by including the locale, and adding locale files to <code>config/locales</code>.</p>
