<p>It seems that you have created an <code>average</code> Object in another class, and are calling the methods given from a main class.</p>

<p>I don't know what exactly you're having trouble with, but one problem is here:  </p>

<p><code>average = grade/totalaverage;</code>  </p>

<p>These 2 variables that you are dividing are both integers. That means that the result will also be an integer. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation" rel="nofollow">truncation</a>. What you want to do is first convert at least one of the integers to a double:  </p>

<p><code>... = (grade * 1.0) / totalaverage;</code></p>

<p>You also want your <code>average</code> variable to be a double instead of an integer so that it can be a lot more accurate.</p>
