<pre><code>document.getElementById("tblBlah").rows[i].columns[j].innerHTML;
</code></pre>

<p>Should be:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("tblBlah").rows[i].cells[j].innerHTML;
</code></pre>

<p>But I get the distinct impression that the row/cell you need is the one clicked by the user. If so, the simplest way to achieve this would be attaching an event to the cells in your table:</p>

<pre><code>function alertInnerHTML(e)
{
    e = e || window.event;//IE
    alert(this.innerHTML);
}

var theTbl = document.getElementById('tblBlah');
for(var i=0;i&lt;theTbl.length;i++)
{
    for(var j=0;j&lt;theTbl.rows[i].cells.length;j++)
    {
        theTbl.rows[i].cells[j].onclick = alertInnerHTML;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That makes all table cells clickable, and alert it's innerHTML. The event object will be passed to the <code>alertInnerHTML</code> function, in which the <code>this</code> object will be a reference to the cell that was clicked. The event object offers you tons of neat tricks on how you want the click event to behave if, say, there's a link in the cell that was clicked, but I suggest checking the MDN and MSDN (for the window.event object)</p>
