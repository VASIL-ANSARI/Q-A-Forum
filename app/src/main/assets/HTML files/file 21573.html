<p>Although I did not find an answer for my question, I managed to get the images by reading the tool bar image list and saving each one to a file according to the given image key.</p>

<pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; this.imageListToolbar3small.Images.Count; ++x)
        {
            Image temp = this.imageListToolbar.Images[x];
            temp.Save(this.imageListToolbar.Images.Keys[x] + ".png");
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This came from an answer to this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1729417/how-to-export-images-from-an-image-list-in-vs2005">How to Export Images from an Image List in VS2005?</a></p>

<p>I just added the code after the InitializeComponent call and saved all images in debug mode. I did not needed to run the full application.</p>

<p>If anyone does have a better idea or a small application to retrieve images from a tool bar using only the resource file, that would be appreciated. I will not mark as an answer since it is more a workaround.</p>
