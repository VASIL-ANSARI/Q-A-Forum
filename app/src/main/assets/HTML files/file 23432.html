<p>Try using <code>oder by</code> on the first column (returning count) using it's position as:</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT COUNT(movie_name), category FROM movies group by category order by 1 asc;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the column alias in the order query as:</p>

<pre><code> SELECT COUNT(movie_name) as total_movies, category
 FROM movies 
 group by category 
 order by total_movies asc;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Based on your inputs, you need to group by <code>movie_name</code> as </p>

<pre><code>  SELECT COUNT(like), movie_name 
  FROM movies 
  WHERE like=1 
  GROUP BY movie_name 
  ORDER BY 1 DESC;
</code></pre>
