<p>Also, By default, The LogCat only shows output from <em>your</em> app, so you might need to configure it to show output from <em>all</em> processes, including ActivityManager. This can be by unselecting "Only Show output from selected process" (next to the tabs in the LogCat panel) And selecting "No Filters" on the right.</p>
