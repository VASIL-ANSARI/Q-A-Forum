<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a phone developer, just a guy with some knowledge I've picked up on this subject.</p>

<p>Firstly, by "Windows Tablets" I imagine you're referring to the Windows RT OS? Or are you referring to Windows 8/8.1 apps in the Store?</p>

<p>In any case, Windows Phone 8 / Windows RT apps can all be developed using a front-end stack (HTML/CSS/Javascript).</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that you can develop apps for Windows/Windows Phone/RT using a variety of different languages, including JS with HTML/CSS. It might be a good idea to read that link and check out some of the samples/tutorials there, since some of them appear to directly apply to your situation.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
