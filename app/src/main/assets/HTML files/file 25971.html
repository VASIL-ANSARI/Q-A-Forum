<p>You need to allow for the status bar which is 20px. You could also turn off the status bar, but that is not recommended.</p>

<p>If you want the status bar to hidden, you need to set the <code>UIStatusBarHidden</code> property to true in your info.plist file. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;UIStatusBarHidden&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That takes care of the status bar when the app is launching. If you also want it invisible after launch, then you need to call the following code:</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES animated:NO];
</code></pre>
