<p>It looks like you're testing whether each read is different enough from <strong>any</strong> previous read, but what you really want is the set of reads that are different from <strong>all</strong> previous reads.</p>

<p>You could set a flag <code>different_enough = True</code> before you enter this loop:<code>for i in lineCharsList:</code></p>

<p>Then, when you test if <code>distance(lineChars, i) &lt; 2</code> set it to <code>different_enough = False</code>.</p>

<p>Don't print out anything inside the loop, wait until after it has completed and then check the status of <code>different_enough</code>. If your read passed every comparison it will still be True, so print out the read. If if even one read was too similar it will be False.</p>

<p>That way you'll only print the read if it passed every comparison.</p>
