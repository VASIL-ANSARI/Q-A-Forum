<p>I know of no such possibility. But you may be able to achieve something similar. As <code>man 7 signal</code> mentions, <code>SIGSEGV</code> can be caught. Thus, I think you could </p>

<ol>
<li>Start with dereferencing a byte sequence known to be a pointer</li>
<li>Access one byte after the other, at some time triggering <code>SIGSEGV</code></li>
<li>In <code>SIGSEGV</code>'s handler, mark a variable that is checked in the loop of step 2</li>
<li>Quit the loop, this page is done.</li>
</ol>

<p>There's several problems with that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since several buffers may live in the same page, you might output what you think is one buffer that are, in reality, several. You <em>may</em> be able to help with that by also <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>ing electric fence which would, AFAIK cause the application to allocate a whole page for every dynamically allocated buffer. So you would not output several buffers thinking it is only one, but you still don't know where the buffer ends and would output much garbage at the end. Also, stack based buffers can't be helped by this method.</li>
<li>You don't know where the buffers end.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Untested.</h3>
