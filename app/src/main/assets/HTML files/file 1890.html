<p>I know of at least two.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must be in control of the allocation.  Not a big one really, but some older api's like to return pointers that you must delete.</li>
<li>No custom deleter.  I don't know why this isn't supported, but it isn't.  That means your shared pointers have to use a vanilla deleter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty weak points. so try to always use make_shared.</p>
