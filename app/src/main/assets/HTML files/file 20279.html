<p>The heap never overflows it just runs out of memory at a certain point (usually when <code>malloc()</code> returns <code>NULL</code>) So to detect out of memory just check the return value of the <code>malloc()</code> call.</p>

<pre><code>if (newuser == NULL)
{
    printf("OOM\n");
    exit(1); /* exit if you want or can't handle being OOM */
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>malloc()</code> internally will request more memory from the OS so it expands dynamically so it's not really fixed size as it will give back pages to the OS that it no longer needs as well as requesting more at any given time that it requires them.</p>
