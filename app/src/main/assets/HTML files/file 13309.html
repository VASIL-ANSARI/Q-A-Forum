<p>Do you insist on having the <code>scrollTop()</code> function overridden? Originally it works for <strong>any</strong> element that you supply via the jQuery selector, while you seem to restrict it to only the facebook canvas. If any other javascript tries to use <code>scrollTop()</code>, it will fail miserably, won't it?</p>

<p>As for the solution, I've done infinite scrolling pretty much the same way - <code>setInterval()</code> to see if you've reached the bottom, then load content, then check scroll again, and so on. But I'm not triggering the original scroll event of the window at any time, as there is no need to - at least in my case.</p>
