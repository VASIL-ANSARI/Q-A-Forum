<p>I would just send the pdf in binary. </p>

<pre><code>fs.readFile(something.pdf,function(err,data){
    if(err){console.log(err)}
    ws.send(data,{binary:true});
}
</code></pre>

<p>And at the client side, I would create a blob and an object url from the received binary data. From this onward, you can pretty much do anything, says open the pdf file in a new window/tab.</p>

<pre><code>conn.onmessage = function(e){
    pdfBlob = new Blob([e.data],{type:"application/pdf"});
    url = webkitURL.createObjectURL(pdfBlob);
    window.open(url);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this help.</p>
