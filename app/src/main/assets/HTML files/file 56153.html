<p>Rails will already run your migrations inside a transaction <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#migration-overview" rel="nofollow"><em>if your database supports it</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On databases that support transactions with statements that change the schema, migrations are wrapped in a transaction. If the database does not support this then when a migration fails the parts of it that succeeded will not be rolled back. You will have to rollback the changes that were made by hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's up to you to use a database that respects transactions when performing schema changes. MySQL (as far as I know) doesn't, but Postgres absolutely does.</p>
