<p>I think that You can try:</p>

<ul>
<li>optimize table(s)</li>
<li>repair table(s) - data may be corrupted in fact or maybe there are some overloads   </li>
<li>check locks: maybe some more inserts is executed on the table(s)
queried by an aggregate queries (maybe some functionalities has been
added recently and users more often submits forms...)</li>
</ul>

<p>I assume that indexes are well defined and database structure was not updated by someone else without Your knowledge ;)</p>
