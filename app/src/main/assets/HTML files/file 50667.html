<p>You can't. You can only query for things that exist in an index. Things with no value unless explicity set to None (and you can't do that for parents) can't be queried.</p>

<p>The only way I can suggest is have a computed property or some other property that you set to None if no parent or the parent key or a flag.  Then you can query for all entities with parent=None.  <code>parent</code> being a property of the entity.</p>
