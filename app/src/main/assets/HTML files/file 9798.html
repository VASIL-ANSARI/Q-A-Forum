<p>PHP has no hands in this. SSL is handled by the webserver only. Apache can be configured to pass some information along in the CGI environment however.</p>

<p>See the manual on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_faq.html#envvars" rel="nofollow">SSLOptions</a> and the available list of <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html" rel="nofollow"><code>SSL_*</code> environment variables</a>. What you wanted to read out is probably:</p>

<pre><code>print $_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_S_DN'];
</code></pre>
