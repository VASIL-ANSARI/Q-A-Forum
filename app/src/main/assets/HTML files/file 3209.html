<p>Yes, these will point to the same string, because they're both defined as string literals.  If you create a string programatically, you'd have to manually intern the string.</p>

<p>This is because the .NET framework interns the string literals in your program into the intern pool.  You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern.aspx" rel="nofollow">String.Intern</a> to retrieve this reference, or to manually intern your own, runtime-generated string.  </p>

<p>For more details, refer to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern.aspx" rel="nofollow">docs for Intern</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consequently, an instance of a literal string with a particular value only exists once in the system.</p>
  
  <p>For example, if you assign the same literal string to several variables, the runtime retrieves the same reference to the literal string from the intern pool and assigns it to each variable</p>
