<p>Not out of the box. See this issue:</p>

<p>But, there are some reasons to not do it and I suggest you to don't fight the framework. If Play uses <code>/conf/routes</code>, stick to it because everything will evolve around this way of doing things. Per instance, by using a custom router that supports annotations, you will probably give up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reverse routing for your views and other controllers</li>
<li>Default controllers offered by the framework (<code>controllers.Assets</code>) or by module creators</li>
<li>Possible performance loss if your solution is not as fast as the default one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not sure if it is worth.</p>
