<p>From the code example you provided, there should be no problem in returning the value without saving it - provided you don't have to access the same value several times. If you do have to access the same value several times it may indeed be a good idea to save the result.</p>

<p>Basically I can see three ways in which this can go:</p>

<ol>
<li>You (normally) don't need to access the same value more than once. Don't save the result and maybe even make the method <code>static</code>.</li>
<li>You often have to access the last value. In that case, save it to a private member and add a getter.</li>
<li>You often have to access prior results, though not necessarily the last result. Also, the method is agnostic (= same input always leads to same output) or if it isn't that's irrelevant. Then save the results to a <code>Map</code> with the path as the key.</li>
</ol>
