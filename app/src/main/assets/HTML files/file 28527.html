<p>If you are redirecting with the Response.Redirect method in the C# Code then before you execute this redirect you can store the items in <code>Session</code> variables:</p>

<pre><code>Session["Test1"] = test1.Text;
</code></pre>

<p>Sessions are maintained per user. These will be retained for as long as the application is running, but be warned that if an Application timeout occurs or the user closes the application (closes browser) these values will be lost.</p>
