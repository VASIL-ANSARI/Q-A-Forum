<p>You have inconsistency between the signal and the slot signatures - the signal has no parameter, the slot requires one parameter. Signatures must match, it is OK if the signal has say an int and a float parameters, in this case you can connect to a slot that takes only an int parameter, and the float will be discarded. In your case you connect a <code>signal(void)</code> to a <code>slot(enum)</code>, but where does the enum value come from?</p>

<p>Instead create another slot that takes no parameters and connect the signal to it, and in that slot <code>m_uiInit.get()-&gt;ClickEvents(Buttons::PausePlayButton);</code></p>

<p>In Qt the signal parameter is not specified upon connection, but upon signal emission - <code>emit someSignal(param)</code>. </p>

<p>That being said, you can use the new connection syntax available in Qt5, and connect to a lambda, which will capture the needed data. It will be similar to creating the auxiliary slot, but it will be an unnamed function for each button instead (only works in Qt5+):</p>

<pre><code>connect(ui-&gt;playPauseButton, &amp;QPushButton::clicked, [=](){ m_uiInit.get()-&gt;ClickEvents(Buttons::PausePlayButton); }); 
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, <code>ui</code> is a pointer, so <code>ui.playPauseButton</code> is wrong as well.</p>
