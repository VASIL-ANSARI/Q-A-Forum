<p>I created an app with 300 Mb text. I uses SQlite DB because i needed fast search in my case. Then I archived DB, put in assets and extract on first run. Result archived DB was 56 Mb. In your case you may do the same. But you don't need use a sqlite if you don't need search, relation data etc. Is not so much choice really,  database or text files depending on the requirements       </p>
