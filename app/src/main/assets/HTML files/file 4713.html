<p>ICollection is not a COM object, which is what you would need for something like that to work.  You need something like:</p>

<pre><code>ICollection^ ptrPopItems = gcnew ArrayList();
</code></pre>

<p>ICollection is an interface, so you need to set it to an instance of a concrete class that implements its interace.  The <code>^</code> is a pointer to a managed object and <code>gcnew</code> calls the managed <code>new</code> to create the object.</p>

<p>Take a look at this C++/CLI page on Wikipedia to learn more</p>

<p>EDIT: If you need to use C++ without the managed extensions, then you need to create classes in C# that do what you want and add the <code>ComVisible</code> attribute to the classes you want to expose.</p>
