<p>Don't define the functions inside the <code>$(document).ready()</code> handler. The names are only accessible inside that function's scope, so they can't be used in inline handlers, which look up the names in the global scope.</p>

<p>The only thing that should be inside that handler are direct actions that need to take place after the document is loaded. Function definitions do not need to be delayed like that.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of using <code>onclick</code> attributes in the HTML, you can use jQuery binding:</p>

<pre><code>$("#savebutton").click(savelocal);
$("#readbutton").click(readlocal);
</code></pre>
