<p>Add a <strong>reference</strong> to the <code>System.Core</code> assembly to your project, and a <code>using System.Linq</code> statement to your source files.</p>

<p>Please note that a <code>using</code> directive does not import an <em>assembly</em> into your project, it only imports symbols from a specified <em>namespace</em>. In order for a namespace to become available, you must first reference an assembly that defines types in that namespace. </p>

<p>If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio and you want to add an assembly reference to your project, open the <em>Project Explorer</em> panel, right-click on your project and go either to <em>Properties</em> or <em>Add reference...</em>.</p>
