<p>Don't print the value.  Processing it (what you more likely are about to do) will work just fine.</p>

<p>If you really want to print it, first convert the unicode string to something your output medium can handle (e. g. a UTF-8 encoded string).  In case there are strange characters in there, you can use this to convert at least the rest:</p>

<pre><code>byteString = value.encode(sys.stdout.encoding, 'ignore')
originalWithoutTrouble = byteString.decode(sys.stdout.encoding)
print(originalWithoutTrouble)
</code></pre>

<p>But of course, then some characters might be missing (in this case the ellipsis <code>â¦</code>, as Martijn pointed out).</p>
