<p>This will only help if you are making a large number of calls to the same selector.  If you are doing this, then yes it could help, but you should be caching accesses in a locally scoped variable if they are exactly the same anyway.</p>

<p>However, you also <strong>break the selector</strong> in the case of dynamic content.  If you call <code>get('.mydiv')</code> and then add another <code>&lt;div class="mydiv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> later, <code>get()</code> will return an object with the latest <code>div</code> missing.</p>

<p>As you alluded to, there is also a memory cost here.  You are trading speed for memory footprint.  In general, this is not an issue, but neither is the performance of jQuery selectors unless you are doing a huge number of selector calls.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, I doubt anyone would have a need for this.  Don't go for optimization unless it is truly an issue.  You should always have a mind toward writing good code, but resist the urge to over-optimize.</p>
