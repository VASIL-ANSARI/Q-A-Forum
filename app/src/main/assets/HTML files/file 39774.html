<p>If you read the JavaDoc you'll see this:</p>

<pre><code>Gets the default TimeZone for this host. The source of the default TimeZone may vary with implementation.
</code></pre>

<p>Thus reason you're getting "America/Rio_Branco" is because the JDK implementation for your host (operating system) thinks you are in Rio Branco's timezone. In the comments you mention you're running Windows 7, so it might be the case that Windows incorrectly has a timezone set somewhere. I think Java on Windows checks in the registry here:</p>

<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/TimeZoneInformation
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you can check that value?</p>
