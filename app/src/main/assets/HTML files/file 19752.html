<p>Only way to suppress the error is if the code runs on your domain and you can catch it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onerror" rel="nofollow"><code>window.onerror</code></a>. If it is on theirs [in iframe/frame], there is nothing you can do.</p>

<p>Tell them to fix it or do not include their page. </p>
