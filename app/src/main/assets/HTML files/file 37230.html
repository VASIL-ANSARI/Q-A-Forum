<p>I'll put the code that fixed the issue for me here in hopes it helps somebody else someday that may search and find it.</p>

<p>By putting the below code in the head of the page, under the...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/UniqueIDprovidedInYourAccountGoesHere.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...library (which is the random characters/numbers .js that SublimeVideo gives you in your account area), I was able to finally get the above detailed problem to work (YAY!!!).</p>

<p>So, using the same example as above, this URL now works as I needed (by not only taking you to the resources page, but also by launching the particular video in its lightbox).</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/resources.php#video=interview2
</code></pre>

<p>...and by putting:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^resources$ resources.php [L]
</code></pre>

<p>...in the .htaccess file in the same dir, I was able to make it even easier for the user:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/resources#video=interview2
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it, the below JavaScript addition finds the hash, then looks for the "video=", then takes whatever is after that, and if it finds a matching "id" in an "a" tag, then it tells it to do it's SublimeVideo thing by launching that video in the lightbox. Brilliant!</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

        $(document).ready(function () {

            var lochash    = location.hash.substr(1);
            var mylocation = lochash.substr(lochash.indexOf('video='))
                             .split('&amp;')[0]
                             .split('=')[1];

            sublime.ready(function () {

                var lightbox = sublime.lightbox(mylocation);
                    lightbox.open();
            });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the HTML part (for reference):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="#video2" id="interview2" class="sublime" data-autoresize="fit"&gt;video2 text link on page that i left as reference for the user in case they close the video that was launched from the publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video id="video2" data-uid="video2" title="video2 description" poster="/assets/images/interview2.jpg" width="1084" height="574" style="display:none" data-autoresize="fit" preload="none"&gt;
    &lt;source src="/assets/videos/interview2.mp4" /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also note: I found out through trial and error that the name of the video in the URL, after the "#video=" must be the same as the "ID" in the "A" tag, not the "video" tag! So, you'll notice that the "id=" is (and needs to be) different between the two. The "id=" in the "video" tag is instead the same as the "href=".</p>
