<p>In the first example, you're appending an array of information to the <code>$crops</code> array, but in the second, you append an empty array to the <code>$crops</code> array, and then set a few keys in that same <code>$crops</code> array.</p>

<p>What you need to do is build your "current crop" array with the second method and then append that array to the <code>$crops</code> list, as before:</p>

<pre><code>$curcrop = array();

if($var1 == something) {
   $curcrop['Type'] = $value1;
}

if($var2 == something) {
   $curcrop['Method'] = $value2;
}else{
   $curcrop['Crop'] = $value3;
}
$crops[] = $curcrop;
</code></pre>
