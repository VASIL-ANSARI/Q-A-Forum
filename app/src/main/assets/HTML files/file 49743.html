<p>The fact that you are calling this code from a ConsoleApplication is an important factor here, since any <code>DependencyObject</code>, the <code>Canvas</code> being one, is required to be created in a Single Thread Affinity context. You should mark the Console thread as STAThread:</p>

<pre><code>[STAThread]
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(@"C:\Users\silviun\Desktop\Canvas.txt");
    XmlReader xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(sr);
    Canvas savedCanvasChildren = (Canvas)XamlReader.Load(xmlReader);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also when inspecting an <code>Exception</code> check the InnerException also, in this case it will have the following message - "The calling thread must be STA, because many UI components require this." which is a common issue when dealing with WPF.</p>
