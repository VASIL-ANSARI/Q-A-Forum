<p>I see three major problems with your import attempt.  First, if the file path is wrong, nothing is going to move.  Second, you should be using <code>IGNORE 1 LINES</code> at the end of the command to tell MySQL that your CSV file has a one line header at the beginning.  Third, I think you should be using <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code>, not <code>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</code>, as you are executing this code from the server, not the client.  Try something along these lines:</p>

<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/path/to/data.csv' INTO TABLE rame
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(giorno, lmedollton, changedolleuro, euroton, lmesterton, delnotiz, girm, sgm);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Unix:</strong></p>

<pre><code>LOAD DATA INFILE '\path\to\data.csv' INTO TABLE rame
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(giorno, lmedollton, changedolleuro, euroton, lmesterton, delnotiz, girm, sgm);
</code></pre>
