<p>I had a similar problem this week and the problem was that when the grid is rendered inside an element where the <code>displayed</code> css attribute is <code>none</code> the grid will be rendered as wide as it's parent container but only 0 pixels high.</p>

<p>You could try showing the dialog and then programmaticly building the grid inside the open dialog.</p>
