<p>Coming from someone who has just as much experience as you do (haven't developed any Eclipse based plugins or anything with GWT), this is purely an opinion from another set of eyes on your problem.</p>

<p>Purely from the standpoint of this application being served from a thin client, I would think GWT would fit the bill for this situation a bit better.  It would certainly be a bit lighter and would not require the overhead that an Eclipse Plugin would.</p>

<p>I also think this would make deploying updates a lot easier.</p>
