<ul>
<li>your computer is used as a client, so you don't make connections with other servers (just your provider), thus is it more time efficient on a server</li>
<li>the support is better on a web hosting environment, so is the security</li>
<li><p>installing, managing a database server can get complicated, so the web hosting company offers you Mysql out of the box (no complicated configurations/installations)</p></li>
<li><p>you might want to shut down your computer once in a while, so the mysql server stops</p></li>
<li><p>your hardware and os is optimized for client work, not for a server, so it's not cost efficient</p></li>
<li><p>it slows down your computer</p>

<p>The only advantage is if you also host your http server (or application server) on your computer, then you don't have to pay the web hosting fee. But it gets complicated, you can mess up easily and the electricity cost you more then a shared hosting (I did the math).   </p></li>
