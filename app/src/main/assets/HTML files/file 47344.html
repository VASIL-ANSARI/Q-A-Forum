<p>I think this is the query you're looking for:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    [RANK]
    , ID
    , NAME
    , SCORE
FROM (
    SELECT
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ID DESC) [RANK]
        , ID
        , NAME
        , SCORE
    FROM Hscore
    WHERE (score&gt;=@scorenumber)
) ResultSet
WHERE Name = 'Milad'
ORDER BY SCORE DESC
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming you're using SQL Server, since you're using the standard notation for a variable, with a @ before the variable name.</p>
