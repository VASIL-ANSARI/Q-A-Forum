<p><a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/1854" rel="nofollow">There's an open issue about it</a> in fullpage.js issues forum.</p>

<p>No solution was implemented yet. The default behavior of fullpage.js is the following one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fullPage.js will animate to the top if you come from a section above the destination one.
  It will animate to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Because the feature was originally though to be used for footers, and in that particular scenario this behavior is the expected one. </p>
