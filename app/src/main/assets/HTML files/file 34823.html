<p>So, in fact my problem was a code problem with one of my classes. I discover this running the tomcat from the console (I am in Windows 8 machine) and analysing the output.</p>

<p>I expected this output should be displayed on the eclipse console, but instead I see only the output from Maven. Anyone knows how to make for this two outputs be shown by eclipse, and avoid the OS console?</p>
