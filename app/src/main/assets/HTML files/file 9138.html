<p>After a bit of toying around with the css on the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Pcd9g/" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle</a>, I didn't find any CSS way to solve this : IE just doesn't want to consider the <strong>img</strong> as a part of the <strong>div</strong>.</p>

<p>I'd suggest you to solve this in javascript. Using onMouseDown.</p>

<p>pseudo : </p>

<pre><code>(div or img).onMouseDown(div.addClass:"active")
(div or img).onMouseUp(div.removeClass : "active").
</code></pre>

<p>I'd suggest using a js framework to make it easier. See <a href="http://api.jquery.com/mouseup/" rel="nofollow">jquery mouseup</a> and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/" rel="nofollow">mousedown</a>.</p>
