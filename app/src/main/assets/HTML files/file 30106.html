<p>Your pattern doesn't work because you have forgotten to put the alternation with month names in a non capturing group <code>(?:...)</code></p>

<p>An other notice:</p>

<p>It's a shame to load a module only to have the month names in english, when you can write them and optimise your pattern! Example:</p>

<pre><code>pattern_1 = r'\b(?:(?:jan|febr)uary|ma(?:y|rch)|ju(?:ne|ly)|a(?:pril|ugust)|(?:octo|(?:sept|nov|dec)em)ber)\s+[0-9]{1,2},?\s+[0-9]{4},?'
</code></pre>
