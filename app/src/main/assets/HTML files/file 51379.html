<p>This sounds like a basic algorithms homework...</p>

<p>Given your <em>existing</em> graph, find the maximum path. Unless you have only two nodes, this will be your answer.</p>

<p>Connect all your new nodes to any node that is not a leaf node of your maximum path.</p>

<p>(Lines that connect nodes are called "edges".)</p>

<p>Let me know if I have misunderstood your problem.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>
Here is a simple graph.
The maximal path is (a,b,c) [which is the same as (c,b,a) -- we'll always order the two leaves so that the smallest comes first].</p>

<pre><code>(a)--(b)--(c)
</code></pre>

<p>I can find it by picking any <em>leaf</em> node -- a node with exactly 1 edge -- and finding my way to another leaf node.
The furthest leaf node will be the longest/maximal path <em>from that node</em>.</p>

<p>Do it again from the leaf node you just found, and you will have the longest/maximal path for the entire graph.</p>

<p>Let's examine how that works with a new graph:</p>

<pre><code>(a)--(b)--(c)--(d)--(e)--(f)
           |
          (s)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to start at node (s). If I find the longest path from it I will find node (f). Node (f) <em>must be</em> one of the endpoints on the longest path in the graph. (I'll leave it to you to think about why.)</p>

<p>Now, I start again at node (f). The longest path from (f) leads to (a). I now have the longest path in the graph: (a,b,c,d,e,f).</p>

<p>Here is another graph:</p>

<pre><code>(a)--(b)--(c)
      |
     (d)
</code></pre>

<p>There are a number of longest paths to choose from. (a,b,c), (a,b,d), and (c,b,d). What matters is that they all exist and have the same length.</p>

<p>Now, to which node should I connect a <em>new</em> node (e) so that I don't change the longest path? Easy:</p>

<pre><code>     (e)
      |
(a)--(b)--(c)
      |
     (d)
</code></pre>

<p>You can guarantee this by only attaching a new node to nodes that are <em>not leaf nodes</em>.</p>

<p>As for your question about how to represent the graph, your idea will work fine, but remember, you have p nodes, not p-1. So, for example, I can represent my 3-node graph as:</p>

<pre><code>       from
      a  b  c 
   a  0  1  0
to b  1  0  1
   c  0  1  0
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the columns: a only leads to one other node. Likewise, c only leads to one other node. 
However, b's column shows that b leads to <em>two</em> other nodes (which is more than one).</p>

<p>Hence, a and c are leaves; b is not.</p>

<p>If I add a new node, I will want to connect it only to nodes that have more than one node already:</p>

<pre><code>   a  b  c  d            a  b  c  d
a  0  1  0  0         a  0  1  0  0
b  1  0  1  0   --&gt;   b  1  0  1  1
c  0  1  0  0         c  0  1  0  0
d  0  0  0  0         d  0  1  0  0
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
