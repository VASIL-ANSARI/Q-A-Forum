<p>If you return the DirectorySecurity dSecurity from AddDirectorySecurity then you could just call <code>Directory.SetAccessControl(directoryName, dSecurity);</code> once you were done with the modified access rules.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>If just SetAccessControl doesn't work the next step might be to explicitly remove the permissions you have granted using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zbfbabws.aspx" rel="nofollow">FileSystemSecurity.RemoveAccessRule</a>. </p>

<p>Just keep a reference to the FileSystemAccessRule you create:</p>

<pre><code>FileSystemAccessRule toRemoveWhenDone = new FileSystemAccessRule(Account, Rights, ControlType);
</code></pre>
