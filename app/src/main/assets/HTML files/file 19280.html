<p>An Order can be seen as a list of Products, a Product as a list of Categories (because it can pertain to multiple categories).</p>

<p>You can try using</p>

<pre><code>//...
using System.Xml;
using System.Xml.Serialization;
//...

[XmlRoot("Order")]
public class Order
{
    [XmlArrayItem(ElementName = "Product", Type = typeof(Product))]
    public List&lt;Product&gt; Products;
}

public class Product
{
    [XmlArrayItem(ElementName = "Category", Type = typeof(Category))]
    public List&lt;Category&gt; Categories;
}

public class Category
{
    [XmlAttribute("Name")]
    public string name;

    [XmlElement("Description")]
    public string description;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only trade-off is, that the <code>&lt;Products&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Categories&gt;</code> (plural) tags will be visible, because the variables are named that way, but from a point of view of parsing the XML afterwards, that's not an issue.
If any other fields show up in your XML that you don't want, you can have <code>[XmlIgnore()]</code> precede them.</p>
