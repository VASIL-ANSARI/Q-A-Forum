<p>From what I can understand from your question is you're wondering why when you go to install your newly added app to the Google Play Store on a tablet, it doesn't say that the app uses this permission:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" android:required="false" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is due to the fact that tablets cannot send SMS text messages, only mobile phones can and therefore it ignores this permission when the user accesses your app store page on a tablet device. </p>

<p>One of your permissions will not be applicable for tablets and therefore Google won't display it. Please note it shouldn't be one where the 'android:required' is set to false. It would be worth checking the others individually though.</p>
