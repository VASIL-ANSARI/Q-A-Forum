<p>That function should be written as a member of the class <code>Car</code></p>

<pre><code>void Car::fuelUp(double fuel)
{
    fuelLevel += fuel;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The way you wrote it, it does not have access to any of the member variables in <code>Car</code> because it is a different function than the one you declared in the class.</p>
