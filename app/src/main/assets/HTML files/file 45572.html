<p>I would suggest you should pass the <code>$index</code> with your <code>$parent.fooObj</code> that will give you track on which element your there</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller="fooControlle as fc"&gt;
    &lt;div ng-repeat"fooObj in fc.fooCollection"&gt;
        &lt;div ng-controller="barController as bc" ng-init="bc.init($parent.fooObj, $parent.$index)"&gt;
            bc output here
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For making it more better your fooObj should have an unique value that could differentiate that it, like you should have something like <code>fooObj = {id: 1, .....}</code></p>
