<p>You definitely can write to distinct elements, and your example is correct. You can have a look at the DRD documentation which provides a more elaborate example</p>

<p><a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html#drd-manual.openmp" rel="nofollow">http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html#drd-manual.openmp</a></p>

<p>Btw, this documentation specifies that "for most Linux distributions (...) you will have to recompile GCC" to use DRD and provides the path to the dedicated script. This might explain your problem in case you skipped this step.</p>
