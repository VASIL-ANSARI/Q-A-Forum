<p>Actually I have encountered with the same problem. After some checking I realized that the constructor of cv::FileStorage always return a bad pointer (Bad Ptr). Actually the same problem happens to other opencv library functions such as imread in the existing project.</p>

<p>I just solved the bug by revising the symbol file cache settings with checking the option:</p>

<pre><code>Options -&gt; Debugging -&gt; Symbols -&gt; Microsoft Symbol Servers
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe someone can give a clear explanation to the weird problem with this symptom and cure. </p>
