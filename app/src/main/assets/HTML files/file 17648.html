<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(u.firstName," ",u.lastName) as user ... WHERE user LIKE '%jay%'
</code></pre>

<p>will not work, but</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(u.firstName," ",u.lastName) as user ... HAVING user LIKE '%jay%'
</code></pre>

<p>will work, as <code>HAVING</code> works on the results of the query, whereas <code>WHERE</code> does not.</p>
