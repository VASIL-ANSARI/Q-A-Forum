<p>I recommend going the Management Service route.  In addition to the msdeploy features, the Management Service feature gives you the ability to remotely administer IIS 7/7.5 from your machine.  With all of your IIS servers in one console, you can easily export an application on one machine and import it onto another.</p>

<p>It seems like the most sophisticated msdeploy implementation from a security provisioning perspective and from a configuration perspective.  The IIS manager allows you to easily configure details around the endpoint (SSL certificate, port, etc.).  Well.. this is true on IIS 7/7.5 on Windows 2008 and R2, but not on Windows Vista or 7.  For some strange reason, there is no UI for the Web Management settings on non-server SKU's.</p>

<p>The agent is basically a self contained web server without any of the user-level permissions capabilities.  This is why it requires that the person doing the remote deployment has admin privileges on the target machine.  It's feels like a simpler, bare metal implementation.  Since you've already got IIS serving up HTTP/HTTPS and since IIS' HTTP implementation has kernel-level optimizations, you're not really gaining anything by going the agent route.</p>

<p>If you want to remotely administer Windows 2008 or R2 from Windows Vista/7, install this on your workstation: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=32c54c37-7530-4fc0-bd20-177a3e5330b7">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=32c54c37-7530-4fc0-bd20-177a3e5330b7</a> ... this was the icing on the cake for me.</p>
