<p>in javascript, reference types can't be compared using equality operator(==).</p>

<p>so <code>consoloe.log([1,2]==[1,2])</code> will return false. 
and because function are instance of Object so it will also return false.</p>

<p>You can NOT use equality operator except for primitive types such as strings and numbers</p>
