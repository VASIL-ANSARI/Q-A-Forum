<p>Not sure what your problem exactly is. If it's just about storing the processed images you can save them with the OpenCV <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#imwrite" rel="nofollow">cv::imwrite</a>. The other option is to use the <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#videowriter-videowriter" rel="nofollow">VideoWriter</a> to encode the images in a video file. There you can specify the frames per second and the encoding as shown in the example.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
