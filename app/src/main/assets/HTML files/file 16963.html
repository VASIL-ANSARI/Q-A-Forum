<p><code>$page_title</code> is just a variable. If you define it, then it will echo. You might want to have <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $page_title?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, again assuming you actually define that variable.</p>

<p>PHP isn't some magical force, it is a programming language and as such it does what you tell it to do.</p>
