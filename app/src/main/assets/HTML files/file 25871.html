<p>This is quite fine in my opinion. Except that, there is a bug in this code. This is because what if each request is done more than a second after one another? It will never go inside that <code>if</code> block. Thus, some kind of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak" rel="nofollow">memory leak</a></em> because the <code>_requests</code> will grow larger over time and possibly never be cleared if my scenario above <strong>always</strong> happens.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
{
   RateLimiter.CheckLimiter();
   Thread.Sleep(2000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you can do is to remove entries in your <code>_requests</code> that are exceeding the 1 second rule like adding this line at the end of your method.</p>

<pre><code>if (_requests.Count != 0)
{
    //remove irrelevant/expired entries
    _requests.RemoveAll(date =&gt; (DateTime.Now - date).TotalMilliseconds &gt;= _perMillisecond);
}
</code></pre>
