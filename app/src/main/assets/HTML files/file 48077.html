<p>It looks like your xdebug.so library is linked incorrectly. Try to link the shared library manually or download a version that matches your OS (including your kernel version) and your version of apache. Also this is a known bug in some versions of apache/php (<a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17147" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17147</a>): try to update your version of apache.</p>
