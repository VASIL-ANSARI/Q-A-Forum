<p>It is important, for thread safety among other reasons, to have a single instance of <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> that you use consistently. That in turn, will require you to have a single <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> class. The exception would be for totally independent database files (one <code>SQLiteHelper</code> per database), but that's not usually needed.</p>

<p>That is not "okay" at all. The highest number wins.</p>

  <p>The only other (reasonable) option I know of is to put all the DB code (covering multiple tables) into a single class that extends SQLiteOpenHelper - is doing so actually the preferred method? IOW, is my separation of the db code into several classes, one for each table, a help or a hindrance?</p>

<p>Breaking out "the db code into several classes, one for each table" is not necessarily a problem. What <em>is</em> a problem is having them be independent subclasses of <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say that you want these classes not merely to handle table creation and upgrades, but also other CRUD operations related to the table. Having a dedicated class for that is fine. However, the table creation and upgrade logic needs to be driven by a single <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> class. Simply have <code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onUpgrade()</code> on your <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> delegate the actual work to the per-table classes. This way, you get your code organization, without having multiple <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> classes.</p>
