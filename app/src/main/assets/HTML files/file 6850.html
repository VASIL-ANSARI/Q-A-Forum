<p>Yes you should concatenate the SMS by hand, but obviously you don't want to be starting up a new activity for each message segment.</p>

<p>I suggest setting your Activity's <code>launchMode</code> attribute to <code>singleTask</code> or <code>singleInstance</code> so that that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Alternatively have your SMS's received by a <code>Service</code>, which will fire up a new <code>Activity</code> only once it has a complete message.</p>
