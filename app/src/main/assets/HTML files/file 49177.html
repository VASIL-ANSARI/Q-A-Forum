<p>First, you should fix your data structure.  Storing two different values in a field is simply bad relational database design.  Storing character strings as numbers is also bad design.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, we are stuck with other people's bad design decisions.  In MySQL, this is pretty easy in your case:</p>

<pre><code>order by (substring_index(count, '-', -1) + 0) / nullif(substring_index(count, '-', 1) + 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>It basically splits the string apart and does the arithmetic.</p>
