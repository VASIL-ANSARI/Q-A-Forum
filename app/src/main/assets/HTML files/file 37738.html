<p>How they're stored in the backend is different for each Python implementation.</p>

<p>But how they're stored has almost nothing to do with why you can't change tuples. You can't change tuples because they were designed to be immutable. They don't implement a <code>__setitem__</code> method or an <code>append</code> method. In <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#abcs-abstract-base-classes" rel="nofollow">ABC</a> terms (which is almost always what you actually care about, not the underlying implementation), they implement only <code>Sequence</code>, not <code>MutableSequence</code>. Under the covers, on most implementations, they aren't much different from lists, except that they may not know how to expand; the difference is really just that the mutating methods are not implemented.</p>

<hr>

<p>In CPython:</p>

<p>Tuples and lists are a small header and a pointer to a contiguous array of pointers to <code>PyObject</code>. If you append to a list when it's already filled the array, it allocates a new, larger array, copies over the existing pointers, then erases the old one.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are a small header plus a pointer to a hash table,* where each bucket is a hash value, a key, and a value (with the keys and values being pointers to <code>PyObject</code>).</p>

<p>The details are documented as part of the C API, in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/concrete.html" rel="nofollow">Concrete Objects Layer</a>. The source code is in the <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Objects" rel="nofollow">Objects</a> directory. (Notice that at the C API level, you can actually call <code>PyTuple_SetItem</code>, and even <code>_PyTuple_Resize</code>, but you're strongly discouraged from doing so if any Python code may be able to see the tuple.)</p>

<p><sub>* Actually, in the latest versions, the hash table can be split into two parts, so that multiple dictionaries can share the same keys. See <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0412/" rel="nofollow">PEP 412</a> and the comments in <code>dictobject.c</code> for details on how that works.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>In PyPy, Python list, tuple, and dict objects are actually implemented in RPython (a subset of Python), which is translated to C through the usual PyPy magic. The tuple and list are pretty much what you'd expect, but the dict has some clever tricks that are worth reading.*</p>

<p><sub>* It basically takes the same "split table" idea furtherâor, more accurately, CPython borrowed PyPy's split table idea and didn't take it as far.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>In Jython and IronPython, they're implemented in Java and C#, respectively. IIRC, early versions of Jython directly used Java collection types for Python types, but they stopped that a long time ago and the code is more similar to CPython (just on top of a Java Array instead of a C pointer-to-a-<code>malloc</code>-region). The implementation is pretty similar to CPython in the 2.5-2.7 days. I assume IronPython is similar, but I haven't looked.</p>

<hr>

<p>In both of the partial Python-in-JavaScript implementations I know of, all three types are implemented on top of JS <code>Object</code>s, but they have to do some ugly stuff with the keys for <code>dict</code>.</p>
