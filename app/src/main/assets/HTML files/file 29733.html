<p>The <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html" rel="nofollow">Spring MVC documentation</a> explains this in the <code>Supported method return types</code> section</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following are the supported return types:</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A String value that is interpreted as the logical view name, with the
  model implicitly determined through command objects and
  @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Your method returns a <code>String</code>, so its value is therefore interpreted as a view name. You probably have declared an <code>InternalResourceViewResolver</code> in your context which takes the view name and tries to resolve an <code>InternalResourceView</code>. This is done by using <code>HttpServletRequest#getRequestDispatcher()</code> with the view name (prefixed and suffixed as configured).</p>

<p>Read the documentation <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-viewresolver" rel="nofollow">on resolving views.</a> </p>
