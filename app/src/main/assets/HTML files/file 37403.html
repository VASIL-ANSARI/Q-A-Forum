<p>Yes, it's still true. Web API 2 has support for async action filters, but MVC 5 still does not. I was just personally frustrated by this not too long ago. For the time being, you will either need to run your async method as sync inside the action filter, or repeat the async code that you would have had in an action filter inside each action that requires it, which you then <em>can</em> run as async.</p>
