<p>If you look at the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.html" rel="nofollow">Android documentation</a> regarding the <code>ViewPager</code>, you can see a full example using <code>ViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener()</code>.</p>

<p>I think that's a good start. From there you notify the current <code>Fragment</code> that it is "selected" (so bold text in your case) and "unselect" the previous one.</p>
