<p>Divide by zero is valid for floating point numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/0 yields Infinity.</li>
<li>(-1)/0 yields -Infinity.</li>
<li>0/0 yields NaN.</li>
</ul>

<p>These "numbers" are properly defined in IEEE 754. </p>

<p>Integer division by zero, on the other hand, throws because one cannot represent infinity as an <code>int</code>.</p>
