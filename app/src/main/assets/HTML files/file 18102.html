<p>Sounds like you have come from a bit of a C background. C# is a little different in the way that we pull in external code, and its actually quite a bit easier than C.</p>

<p>To reference some code using Visual Studio, you will need to add a reference to that dll. once you have the dll included (via a reference) in your project you can use it in your code by adding a using statement and then instantiating objects from that library</p>

<p>MSDN docs around this are here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky.aspx</a></p>

<p>EDIT:
if you are outside of VS as you have specified there's a few things you will need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let your compiler know where the assembly is so that it can correctly link</li>
<li>Add the assembly to your running directory (it should sit alongside your executable)
<ul>
<li>OR add your library to the GAC</li>
<li>OR manually load it with an Assembly.Load call</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
