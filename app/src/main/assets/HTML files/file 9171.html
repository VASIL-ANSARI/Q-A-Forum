<p>I wouldn't let the resizable issue stop you, it's on the way:

<p>Datatables is far and away the most featured, well written, and best supported grid solution out there, and I've probably either used or researched them all.  Just the Ajax options alone make it more powerful than its next nearest competitor.  While you're waiting for resizing, get it fully working and get all the features in that you want.  </p>

<p>I was thinking I needed resizing too, but found with intelligent UI planning that it really wasn't at all missed.  My clients LOVE the sorting, paging, ajax load, etc, and I love the fact that it's fully integrated with ThemeRoller so I can rebrand an app in just minutes.</p>
