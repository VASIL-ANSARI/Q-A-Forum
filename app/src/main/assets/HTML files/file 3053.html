<p>It should have enough knowledge to do its work and no more. It's fine to have a lookup for artists by slug if "slug" is an attribute of the "artist" record, because the layer knows that already. If the assignment of slugs to artists follows complex, intricate rules (think heraldry, or something like that), then the repository should not implement those, except if you absolutely have to use clever optimizations that only work on this level, e.g. special database query constructions.</p>
