<p>Since i needed this to work i explored other ways... What i did was transform Publication::all() to Publication::query() ( this will get you QueryBuilder ) Then i worked with Query Builder ->where(field,comparison,value) and then finally retrieved the result with $records->get(); That Way you will still get the Model Collection because if you use DB::table('publications') and then the same code when you do ->get() you will only get the array of elements and no relationship loading like in model. Hope i made my point and explained well. And sorry if i did not. I really tried my best. This is now SOLVED!</p>
