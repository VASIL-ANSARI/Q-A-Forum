<p>When you pass array as an argument to function it decays as an pointer to its first element.    </p>

<p>So,      </p>

<pre><code>void Name1(int x, int y, int *z)
</code></pre>

<p>will work.<br>
But arrays are not assignable so:      </p>

<pre><code>c = z;
</code></pre>

<p>does not work, you will need to explicitly copy each array element from source to destination.</p>
