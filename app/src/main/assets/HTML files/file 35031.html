<p><code>search</code> returns nothing. But the event handler needs to be a function. So either you do <code>U.addEvent(U.$('searchBox'), 'click', search);</code> or make <code>search()</code> return an event handler.</p>

<p>Basically right now you are immediately invoking the search handler and your form does nothing.</p>

<p>You also have the <code>click</code> handler on an <code>input</code> field. That will be pretty much useless, since you don't want anything to happen when the user just clicks the input field.</p>
