<p>If you want to animate the height of a View, you need to write your own <strong>custom-animation</strong> and modify the <code>LayoutParams</code> of your animated view.
In this example, the animation animates the <strong>height</strong> of the animated View.</p>

<p>This is how it could look like:</p>

<pre><code>public class ResizeAnimation extends Animation {

    private int startHeight;
    private int deltaHeight; // distance between start and end height
    private View view;

    /**
     * constructor, do not forget to use the setParams(int, int) method before
     * starting the animation
     * @param v
     */
    public ResizeAnimation (View v) {
        this.view = v;
    }

    @Override
    protected void applyTransformation(float interpolatedTime, Transformation t) {

        view.getLayoutParams().height = (int) (startHeight + deltaHeight * interpolatedTime);
        view.requestLayout();
    }

    /**
     * set the starting and ending height for the resize animation
     * starting height is usually the views current height, the end height is the height
     * we want to reach after the animation is completed
     * @param start height in pixels
     * @param end height in pixels
     */
    public void setParams(int start, int end) {

        this.startHeight = start;
        deltaHeight = end - startHeight;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean willChangeBounds() {
        return true;
    }
}   
</code></pre>

<p>In code, <strong>create a new Animation and apply it to the RelativeLayout</strong> that you want to animate:</p>

<pre><code>View v = findViewById(R.id.youranimatedview);

// getting the layoutparams might differ in your application, it depends on the parent layout
RelativeLayout.LayoutParams lp = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) v.getLayoutParams();

ResizeAnimation a = new ResizeAnimation(v);
a.setDuration(500);

// set the starting height (the current height) and the new height that the view should have after the animation
a.setParams(lp.height, newHeight);

v.startAnimation(a);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>To your LayoutParams problem:</strong> </p>

<p>My guess is that you are getting a <strong>ClassCastException</strong> because you are not using the correct LayoutParams class. If your animated view for example is contained by a RelativeLayout, you can only set <code>RelativeLayout.LayoutParams</code> to it. If your View is contained by a LinearLayout, you can only set <code>LinearLayout.LayoutParams</code> for your View.</p>
