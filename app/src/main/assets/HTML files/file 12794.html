<p>Nginx does not support chunked requests indeed. It would return <code>411 Content Length required</code> in absence of <code>Content-Length</code> header.</p>

<p>Since you are controlling your client code, I guess the only choice is to avoid using chunked requests and to specify <code>Content-Length</code> explicitly.</p>
