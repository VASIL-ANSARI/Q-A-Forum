<p>Both scenarios have their pros and cons and both are widely used in the Umbraco community / solutions. I prefer 2nd solution, as especially on larger sites it gives you ability to restrict access for different language editors for example and not each site has a requirement to be 1-1 content structured.</p>

<p>There is an Umbraco TV episode covering this topic here: <a href="https://umbraco.tv/videos/umbraco-v7/implementor/multi-lingual/creating-a-multi-lingual-site/introduction/" rel="nofollow">https://umbraco.tv/videos/umbraco-v7/implementor/multi-lingual/creating-a-multi-lingual-site/introduction/</a>.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>you need to create copy of your root language node</li>
<li>then setup the culture for it</li>
<li>use dictionary items to translate static content for each language</li>
<li>create simple language picker choosing related site or just redirecting to selected language root</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding your questions:</p>

<p><strong>Ad.1.</strong> I don't have :)</p>

<p><strong>Ad.2.</strong> It's selecting culture set up on the node(s), so it may be forced. Other than that it use standard .NET culture detection, so yes - it's using "accept-language" headers.</p>

<p><strong>Ad.3.</strong> There is a key "umbracoHideTopLevelNodeFromPath" which enables you to include top level roots in the url paths.

<p>And still, if you prefer to go with option 1, there is an awesome article about it with example code as well: <a href="http://24days.in/umbraco/2015/multilingual-vorto-nested-content/" rel="nofollow">http://24days.in/umbraco/2015/multilingual-vorto-nested-content/</a>. I will be playing with it now too! :)</p>
