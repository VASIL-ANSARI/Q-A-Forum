<p>I can see you are using a grid system on your markup, you should take a look if this grid system provide you a option to do that, that would be the better way to accomplish what you want.</p>

<p>Anyway for do that you should use `%``instead of pixels or auto, example:</p>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>input{
    width: 80%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if its possible a url so we can't take a look would make much easier to help you out</p>
