<p>In order to validate numeric data with precision and scale I used reg ex as my first method would handle length not numeric data validation.</p>

<p>The mistake in following code was 
1. I was trying to match column name and not data
2. "match" was not working for me so I used "test"</p>

<p>The code should be like</p>

<pre><code>var currentRowKey = [eventArgs.get_displayText()];
var regex = [
        ["total_amount"],
        ["price"],
        ["market_value"]

              ];
              for (var i = 0; i &lt; regex.length; ++i) {
                  if (currentColumnName == regex[i].toString()) {

                      var re = /^(\d{0,22}\.\d{0,8})$/;
                      if (!re.test(currentRowKey)){
                          var error = (regex[i]+"is incorrect");
                          alert(error);
                          eventArgs.set_cancel(true);

                      }
                  }
</code></pre>

<p>reg ex: The one in code works fine for those who want to handle decimal positive numbers only.</p>

<p>I wanted to handle whole numbers, +_ numbers, decimal numbers and nulls so I used the following:</p>

<pre><code>var re = /^-?\d{0,22}(\.\d{0,8})?$/;
</code></pre>
