<p>You are really trying experimental things here and, to be honest, I wonder why you're not using one of the <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/jBPM3TargetContainers" rel="nofollow">supported container</a> (well, the matrix is actually not up to date and if I remember well, the installer of jBPM 3.3.1 suggests JBoss 4.2.2, JBoss 4.2.3, JBoss 5.0.0).</p>

<p>Anyway, JBoss Web being based on Tomcat, did you try to follow the steps of <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JbpmOnTomcat" rel="nofollow">JbpmOnTomcat</a>? It seems that you need to build a jbpm-console.war customized for deployment on TC. There is no guarantee that all this will work though. If it doesn't, just use a supported platform.</p>
