<p>The problem is that although you create instance for the container class <code>Nested</code> you don't create instances for the enclosed classes <code>FirstNested</code> and <code>SecondNested</code>. In order to make these kind of instances you can change your class like this</p>

<pre><code>public static class Nested
{
    public static class FirstNested
    {
        public Object nestedField1;
        public Object nestedField2;
    }

    public static class SecondNested
    {
        public Object nestedField3;
        public Object nestedField4;
    }

    public FirstNested nested1;
    public SecondNested nested2;

}
</code></pre>

<p>You have to make the inner classes static so they can be accessed easily by reflection. Then you have to implement (maybe in a recursive way) the creation of new instances and registering those instances to your container class instance.</p>

<p>Something like this</p>

<pre><code>Object memberClassInstance = field.getType().newInstance();
field.set(classInstance, memberClassInstance);
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can keep the classes as they are and use something like this</p>

<pre><code>Object memberClassInstance = field.getType().getConstructor(Nested.class).newInstance()
</code></pre>
