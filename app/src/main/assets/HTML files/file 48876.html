<p>As I wrote in comment it is connected with how floats are stored in memory</p>

<p>From manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never trust floating number results to the last digit, and do not compare floating point numbers directly for equality. If higher precision is necessary, the arbitrary precision math functions and gmp functions are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know what you want to do with this float variable but if you want to compare then you need some $epsilon</p>

<p><code>if(abs($a-$b) &lt; $epsilon)</code></p>

<p>if you want to round then probably you should ignore last digit. number_format() seems like better solution.</p>
