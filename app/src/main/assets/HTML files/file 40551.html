<p>First thing to do would be open the developer tools in the browser, before the getJSON request is made. Then (e.g. in Chrome) click on the Network tab. Find the Http Get request made for the getJSON call, and click on it. Inspect any errors, check that the cookies were sent correctly, check the response data, right click the Url and open in new tab, what result do you get?</p>
