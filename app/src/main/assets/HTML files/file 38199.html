<p>The context you are using the function keyword in (on the RHS of an assignment) makes it a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function" rel="nofollow">function <em>expression</em></a>, not a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function" rel="nofollow">function declaration</a>.</p>

<p>Putting a name between <code>function</code> and <code>()</code> makes it a named function, but since it is not a function declaration it doesn't create a variable in the current scope.</p>

<p>Note that named function expressions have <a href="http://kiro.me/blog/nfe_dilemma.html" rel="nofollow">memory leak issues</a> in old-IE.</p>
