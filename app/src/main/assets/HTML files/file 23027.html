<p>You're right, some indexes are created with a length greater than the max limit. The issue is that MySQL 5.6 does not silently truncate indexes anymore. This behavior does not seem to be expected (see <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-restrictions.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-restrictions.html</a> and the bug <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68453" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68453</a>).</p>

<p>All that to say that Sonar 3.5 fixes this issue by creating indexes with the correct length (see <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONAR-4137" rel="nofollow">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONAR-4137</a>).  </p>
