<p>Why not this?</p>



<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>  float val = 1.23456789

  float rounded_down = floorf(val * 1000) / 1000;   /* 1.2345 */
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>as pointed out in the comments keep in mind that this is an approximation, but it might be acceptable in many situations. 
Also yo might want to round to the nearest value or to round up as follows:</p>



<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>  float val = 1.23456789

  float near = roundf(val * 1000) / 1000;   /* nearest */
  float up = ceilf(val*1000) / 1000; /* up*/
</code></pre>
