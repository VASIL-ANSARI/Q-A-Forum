<p>The designer cannot supply a <code>ObvervableCollection&lt;Part&gt;</code> instance to the MyWindow constructor, because it does not know how. so your constructor should never be called in the designer. 
that is why the designer "cannot resolve symbol 'DoImport' due to unknown datacontext".
the designer in visual studio expects a parameter-less default constructor in order to work properly.</p>

or better yet ... let blend create design sample data for you.</p>
