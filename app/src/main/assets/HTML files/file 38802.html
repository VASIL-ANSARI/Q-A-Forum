<p>Since your var_dump of $product['price'] shows it is a string you need to convert it to an integer first - use</p>

<pre><code>if (intval($product['price']) == 0) {
    //do something
}
else {
    //do something else
}
</code></pre>

<p>If possible though, it would be better to change your actual database so that the field you're looking at is an integer to begin with (stops someone saving a price as "SomeRandomLetters" instead ;)</p>
