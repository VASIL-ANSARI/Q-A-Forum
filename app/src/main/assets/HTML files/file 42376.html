  <p>Thanks a lot for your responses. Special thanks @AnthonyBCodes for your advice instead of a check box use a radio button which solved my problem. I changed my code from a check box to a radio button as below.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>                RadioButton chk = new RadioButton();
                chk.GroupName = "radio";
                chk.Text = e.Row.Cells[i].Text;
                e.Row.Cells[i].Controls.Add(chk); 
</code></pre>
