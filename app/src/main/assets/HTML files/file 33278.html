<p>According to the <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/database/configuration.html" rel="nofollow">documentation page</a> for the CodeIgniter DB drivers, the available values are <code>mysql, postgres, odbc</code>. So, change the <code>$db['offline']['dbdriver']</code> value from <code>postgre</code> to <code>postgres</code> and try again. It should connect without problems as long as your username and password are right.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There are other sources which suggest that the driver name is actually <code>postgre</code> instead of <code>postgres</code>, contrary to the documentation (that's a shame, really). So I'd suggest that you try with <code>postgres</code> and <code>postgresql</code>. If it's still not working, check your php.ini, and check if you have uncommented the PostgreSQL module (search for <code>extension=php_pgsql</code> line). </p>

<p>The module is called <code>php_pgsql.so</code> on Linux boxes, and <code>php_pgsql.dll</code> on Windows. </p>

<p>If you see it and it has <code>;</code> before the line, remove the <code>;</code> and restart the Apache server (it should be available on Windows). If not, you need to install it first and then add it to php.ini. The installation varies from distro to distro, but there are plenty of tutorials on how to install it on a Linux box.</p>
