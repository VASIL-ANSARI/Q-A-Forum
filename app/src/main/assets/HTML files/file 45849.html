<p>I think you are looking for the foreach loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($products as $product){
    if($product['handmade'] === 'true'){
       //do this
    }
    else {
       //do that
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will iterate through the items in the product array, and check each one to see if it is handmade.  If this is not what you are trying to do, give more information.</p>
