<blockquote>
  <p>As of 4.x, Express no longer depends on Connect. All of Express' previously included middleware are now in separate repos. Please view <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#middleware" rel="nofollow">the list of middleware</a>. The only included middleware is now express.static().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have to explicitly include all the needed middlewares in the <code>package.json</code>, as a dependency. See the link in the quoted text to get to know the repository information of all the middlewares.</p>
