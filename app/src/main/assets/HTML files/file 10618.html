<p>For the most part, the answer is no, and intentionally so. In particular, you cannot run executable code that you download. If you figured out a workaround to allow it technically (and I have at least one or two thoughts in mind on how I'd attack it), it would definitely run counter to Apple's approval process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a nib file is data, not code. That you can definitely read from disk and instantiate using <code>[UINib nibWithData:bundle:]</code>. This is a pretty big hassle, though, and I don't particularly recommend it. But it's relatively straightforward (unless you want to correctly handle low memory situations, in which case it's a bit more of a hassle).</p>

<p>Of course you can always have dynamic code by putting it in a webview and writing it in JavaScript.</p>

<p>In the end, though, the review process is the way it is on purpose, and I recommend developers adapt their development cycle to include it. That generally means having fewer releases with heavier testing because "one quick fix" is expensive.</p>
