<p>As Eric Lippert himself says <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2970322/3832080">here</a>, this is "perfectly acceptable practice; the C# language has been carefully designed so that this is legal and practical."</p>

<p>Furthermore, in this case it seems unambiguous what your String property means: you have a class which is like a string, but serializable, and this property returns the underlying string. Suppose in fact that <code>String</code> was not a primitive type, and the primitive type was <code>str</code> or something. Then it does not seem to me that there would be any problem or ambiguity in calling this property (the central property of your class) simply "String" (with return type <code>str</code> in my hypothetical case)</p>
