<p>I'd recommend that you refactor your code as it's hard to follow as it is - for example the <code>showTable()</code> method could be renamed <code>getTable()</code> as you're returning the table that you have created.</p>

<p>From my comment - add the table to the layout and set it to <code>BorderLayout.CENTER</code>. See the docs on layouts <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/border.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>What I mean is that you'd layout your components onto the BorderLayout based on their respective location. </p>

<p>You want the table to inhabit the center which will leave the <code>SOUTH</code> (otherwise known as <code>PAGE_END</code>) open to its own component, i.e. the space.</p>

<pre><code>JPanel btnPanel = new JPanel("Button");        // Add your logic to create the button panel
frame.add(btnPanel , BorderLayout.PAGE_START); // Or BorderLayout.NORTH

JPanel tblPanel = new JPanel("Table");         // Table panel
frame.add(button, BorderLayout.CENTER );       // Inhabits center

JPanel southPanel = new JPanel("South Panel");
frame.add( southPanel,BorderLayout.SOUTH );
</code></pre>
