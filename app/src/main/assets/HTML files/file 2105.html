<p>My understanding is that MySQL enum type is very proprietary and not well supported by Hibernate, see <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBSEAM-637?focusedCommentId=12349681#action_12349681">this comment</a> from Gavin King (this related issue is a bit different but that's not the important part). </p>

<p>So, I actually think that you'll have to use your own <code>UsereType</code> and I'd recommend to use the <strong>Flexible solution - working version</strong> from the <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/272.html">Java 5 EnumUserType</a> (see Appfuse's <a href="http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Java+5+Enums+Persistence+with+Hibernate">Java 5 Enums Persistence with Hibernate</a> for an example).</p>

<p>Personally, I'd just forget the idea to use MySQL enum, I'm not convinced that the "benefits" are worth it (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766299/mysql-enum-performance-advantage">this answer</a> for more details).</p>
