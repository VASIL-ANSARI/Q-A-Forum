<p>It depends on how <code>parentClass.php</code> is loaded.</p>

<p>Unless you use <code>require_once</code> or <code>include_once</code> the file will be included multiple times, which in return will lead to a Fatal Error, as each class may only be defined once.</p>

<p>If you are using an autoloader the file will only be included once, as it will only load unknown classes.</p>
