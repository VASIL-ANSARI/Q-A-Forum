<p>The OpenFileDialog is spitting out an absolute path behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If you know the location of raf file you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>string parentPath = Directory.GetParent(rafFilePath);
string imagePath = Path.Combine(parentPath, imageFileNameFromRaf);
</code></pre>

<p>imagePath will now contain the absolute path to your image derived from the image name contained in the raf file, and the directory the raf file was in.</p>
