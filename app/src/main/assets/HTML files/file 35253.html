<p>If you have access to your php.ini, simply enable the <code>zlib</code> extension to use <code>gzencode</code>. Each compression method has some slight differences. </p>

<p>All of these are usable. I would use gzencode() because it is self-contained; its output is the same as if you had used the gzip command line tool.</p>

<p>There is not really much difference between the three.</p>

<ul>
<li>gzencode() uses the fully self-contained gzip format, same as the
gzip command line tool </li>
<li>gzcompress() uses the raw ZLIB format. It is
similar to gzencode but with less header data, etc. I think it was
intended for streaming. </li>
<li>gzdeflate() uses the raw DEFLATE algorithm on
its own, which is the basis for both the other formats.</li>
</ul>
