<p>Your <code>for</code> loop is always executed exactly five times, no matter how often you encounter a <code>null</code> within the loop's body. You can verify this by manipulating the size of <code>deck</code> to something <code>&lt; 5</code>. If your method were working correct, it should get caught in an endless loop. instead, you will get at least <code>5 - deck.size</code> many <code>null</code>s. A quick&amp; dirty fix would be to decremt <code>l</code> in case you encounter a <code>null</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (deck[index] != null) {
    // ...
} else /* if (deck[index] == null) */ {
    --l;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend a different strategy alltogether. Instead of generating a random index every time you want to draw a card, you could determin the order of all cards up-front, e.g. with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="nofollow">Fisher-Yates-Shuffle</a>. This way, you need only to remember how many cards were drawn and extract the next card from your array/list/queue.</p>
