<p>I think your issue is <em>probably</em> that the tool you're opening up the CSVs with on the other end doesn't want more than 65535 rows, not that Java's doing anything wrong.  It's a bug on the other end, not your Java code, almost certainly.  (<code>FileWriter</code> wouldn't care at all about 65535 lines, for example.)</p>

<p>If you're using Excel 2003, for example, you'd see this issue: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7121871/how-to-get-around-64k-row-limit-in-excel">How to get around 64k row limit in excel</a></p>
