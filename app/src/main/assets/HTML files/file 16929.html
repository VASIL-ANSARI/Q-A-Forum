<p>Are you just talking about making your app run using the full screen on an iPhone 5 (getting rid of the letterbox)? If so, you don't use the new image size as a background image somewhere in code; you have to add it to your project file as a launch image. See the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconsImages/IconsImages.html" rel="nofollow">Launch Images</a> section of the Apple docs for more info.</p>
