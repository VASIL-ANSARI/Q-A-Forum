<p>The changing of the day of month is the expected behaviour, documented here, as "Add rule 2": <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>add(f, delta)</strong> adds delta to field f. This is equivalent to calling set(f, get(f) + delta) with two adjustments:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Add rule 1.</strong> The value of field f after the call minus the value of field f before the call is delta, modulo any overflow that has occurred in field f. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Add rule 2</strong>. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field f is changed or other constraints, such as time zone offset changes, then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. HOUR is a smaller field than DAY_OF_MONTH. No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system determines what fields are expected to be invariant.</p>

<p>With these rules in place, there's no way to keep the day of month if you add 1 month, followed by adding -1 months.</p>
