<p>I don't know what type of project it is whether it's Maven or not. Just do this things hope it will help : </p>

<ol>
<li>Goto Project -> Clean</li>
<li>If you are using maven project do a Maven clean &amp; install.</li>
<li>Clean your server.</li>
<li>Remove already deployed item.</li>
<li>Restart your server.
If still the problem persists checks if there is any service using that port or not.</li>
</ol>
