<p>If you're concerned about memory not getting released, I think the analysis will be simplified if you focus on the generations after you return to <code>TitleScreen</code>. Looking at generations when you're at <code>ChoosePlayer</code> are probably only confusing the situation.</p>

<p>So, fire up the app and get the initial title screen, do generation A. Go to <code>ChoosePlayer</code> (don't do a generation) and then return to <code>TitleScreen</code> again (wait a second) and do generation B. Repeat that process for generation C and D.</p>

<p>Having done that, focus your attention on generations C and D. Don't worry about A (which has everything consumed during startup), nor even B (which might include stuff that might be cached). You really want to focus your attention on generations after you return the second, third, and subsequent times.</p>
