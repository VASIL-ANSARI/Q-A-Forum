<p>It would seem that "ball" is an instance created from Bodies. You should make an instance for every ball you want to add to the world.</p>

<pre><code>var ball = function () {

    return Bodies.circle(400, 20, 23, {
        density: 0.0005,
        frictionAir: 0.06,
        restitution: 0.3,
        friction: 0.01,
        render: {
            sprite: {
                texture: 'face2.png',
            }
        }
    });
}

$('.add').on('click', function () {
    World.add(engine.world, ball());
})
</code></pre>
