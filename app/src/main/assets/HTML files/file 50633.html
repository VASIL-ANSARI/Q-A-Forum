<p>Best practice is to avoid <code>static Singleton</code> and replace them by <code>contextual Singleton</code>.</p>

<p>Common pattern for <code>static Singleton</code> access is using a <code>static getInstance()</code> method. Which can be easily change to factory method or complex initialization process without changing signature.</p>

<p>However, if signature doesn't change, behaviour does. So it might require changing code at caller site.</p>

<p><code>Type B</code> and <code>Type C</code> are strictly equivalent. Only <code>Type A</code> may be broken (in future) due to change in internal state of the class (such as lazy loading).</p>
