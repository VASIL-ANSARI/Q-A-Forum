<p>So I'm just guessing at what your problem is since you didn't really explain what problem you're running into, but it looks like you didn't define foreign keys in your schema, so you're database doesn't know how to do the look ups on your association.  I would rewrite your migration like so:</p>

<pre><code>create_table "users", force: true do |t|
  t.string  "name"
  t.string  "email"
  t.string  "password_digest"
  t.integer "tel"
end

create_table "roles", force: true do |t|
  t.string  "description"
  t.string  "name"
  t.references :user
end

execute &lt;&lt;-SQL
  ALTER TABLE roles
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_roles_users
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES users(id)
SQL
</code></pre>
