<p>.NET is .NET ... the difference between VB.NET and C# is merely syntax.  You won't ever "finish" learning VB.NET anyway, so you might as well learn the C# syntax for doing the same things you know how to do in .NET. :-)</p>

<p>Any new objects or libraries you learn with one language will be usable in the other, with only the minor syntax difference in how to call it.  So even while learning a new syntax with C#, you will also be improving the ".NET" part of your VB.NET knowledge.</p>
