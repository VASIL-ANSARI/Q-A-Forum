<p>Using above as your image source path would suggest that its physical path is in "/var/www/home/image.jpg". Is this correct? I would also assume that your apache's root directory is at /var/www/html. You can try hard-coding the actual and complete physical path of your image for tracing purposes, but it's not going to a good practice. Finally, you can trace it in your apache logs as to what actual location is being accessed in your given img source path. </p>
