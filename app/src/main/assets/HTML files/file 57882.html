<p>You are using very old version of Java JDK7 update 21. Crash occured in GC. GC Issue is caused by any bug that corrupts heap memory. It could be an issue with GC, with the compiler, with bad native code. Without reproducer it is hard to debug. Do you have any specif test case that can reproduce this issue, then possibly there will be solution. Suggested solution is to upgrade your java version</p>
