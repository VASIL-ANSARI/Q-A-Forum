<p>You can't return a structure only a pointer to it, provided we are talking about <code>C</code>. Assuming you allocated the space for your <code>struct</code> via <code>malloc</code>/<code>calloc</code> it is the pointer which would be returned. It is difficult to tell whether it would be returned in a register or on the stack, that depends on the optimisation level.</p>
