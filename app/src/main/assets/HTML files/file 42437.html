<p>A place to start would be this line in the phpunit-skelgen file:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (array(__DIR__ . '/../../autoload.php', __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php') as $file) {
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that the autoload.php file(s) referred to actually exist.  The way to test is to add something like:</p>

<pre><code>echo __DIR__ . '/../../autoload.php' . "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>...before foreach loop and see if what it spits out is actually in your file system.  I am using Laravel 5, and the autoload.php is located in a directory called "bootstrap".  I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (array(__DIR__.'/../bootstrap/autoload.php', __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php') as $file) {
</code></pre>

<p>...and was able to take things to the next step (still not able to generate a skeleton test, but there are other issues).</p>
