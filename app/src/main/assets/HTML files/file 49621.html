<p>A very good coordinate converter is this one: <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/WikiStart" rel="nofollow">Proj4</a>
It is written in C, In order to use it in C#, you can use this wrapper: <a href="http://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/Public/BDB/Tools/proj4/" rel="nofollow">.NET wrapper for Proj4</a></p>

<p>Another very good library written in C# is <a href="http://dotspatial.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">DotSpatial</a></p>

<p>Other projects are <a href="http://proj4net.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Proj4Net</a> and <a href="http://projnet.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Proj.Net</a>, however I don't know their quality, perhaps they are just copy/paste of other projects. For sure they are all inspired by the original Proj4 project.</p>
