<p>I think it should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= div_for @comments do |comment| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm a bit surprised it does not throw any error here.</p>

<p>Edit: You also don't set <code>@comments</code> instance variable anywhere in the controller: <a href="https://github.com/rocka0/blog-in-rails/blob/master/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb#L13" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rocka0/blog-in-rails/blob/master/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb#L13</a> You should do it or use <code>@post.comments</code> instead.</p>
