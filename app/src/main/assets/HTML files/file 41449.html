<p>This probably happens due to caching. when you open the css itself, it retrieves a new copy from the server, but when you open a page that uses the css file, the css file is being cached as the page's resource and the browser just shows the cached resources until you force it to reload them.</p>

<p>a trick i learned to fix the issue, is to link the css file to the aspx page and include a random query string to the linking, that way it tricks the browser to think that its a new resource and reload it from the server anyway.</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="../stylesheets/MyCSS.css?&lt;%=DateTime.Now%&gt;" 
      rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>we  use the aspx preprocessor directive <code>&lt;%=DateTime.Now%&gt;</code> to append the current time as a query string, to ensure the link is always different.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dont forget the question mark between the css filename and the preprocessor directive</li>
</ul>
