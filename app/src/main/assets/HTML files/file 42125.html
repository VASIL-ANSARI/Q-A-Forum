<p>You have no OS installed in your VM.  Creating a VM with a new virtual disk in VirtualBox manager just creates an empty virtual drive with nothing on it.  You have to install something or point it an an existing image of some sort.  It's just as if you had installed an empty hard drive in your PC and tried to boot.</p>

<p>That said, if you have installed Genymotion and want to set up some VMs as Android Studio targets, you shouldn't have to do anything directly with VirtualBox.  In fact, Genymotion VMs cannot be created directly with VirtualBox because the images have to be first downloaded by the Genymotion launcher.  Once downloaded, Genymotion takes care of creating the necessary vbox files and images. Just open the launcher, press the Add (+) button (shown below) and follow the prompts. When done, use the Start (>) button to launch the VM. Under normal circumstances, you'll never see or have to use VirtualBox directly.</p>

<p>As far as removing a VM through the VirtualBox Manager, yes, if you select Delete All Files, the entire directory and everything in it will be gone.</p>
