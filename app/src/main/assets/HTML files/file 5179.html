<p>First of all, do not use "ex.Message". It only shows you the text of the top-level exception. Use ex.ToString() instead.</p>

<p>Secondly, look at the properties of the XmlReader at the time of the exception. Also, look carefully at all of the properties of the <code>XmlException</code> you are being passed. It has <code>LineNumber</code> and <code>LinePosition</code> properties.</p>
