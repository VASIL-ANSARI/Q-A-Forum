<p>You have to call <code>CFBridingRelease()</code>  to decrease the retain count.
So store a pointer to the object returned by <code>CFBridgingRetain()</code> and release it when you no longer need it.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/miscellaneous/foundation_functions/reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CFBridgingRetain" rel="nofollow">Documentation on Foundation Functions</a></p>

<p>Alternatively you could use a bridge cast instead of calling <code>CFBridgingRetain()</code></p>
