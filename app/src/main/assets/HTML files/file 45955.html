<p>You give no information about the crash, but from the look of those commented out lines, you are having problems accessing the results of your fetch.  First, you need to set the predicate for the fetch request <em>before</em> you execute the fetch.  Then, the return value from <code>executeFetchRequest</code> is an array - even if there is only one matching object.  So rearrange your fetch as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var error: NSError?
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Plants")
let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "name == %@", name)
fetchRequest.predicate = predicate
let appDel: AppDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate
let contxt: NSManagedObjectContext = appDel.managedObjectContext!
let fetchResults = contxt.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest, error: &amp;error)
// You should check whether fetchResults is nil, and if so log the error. 
//  You should also ensure that at least one object is returned.
let object = fetchResults![0]
println("\(object)")
</code></pre>
