  <p>Was instructed, for a university-level assignment, to receive user

  precisely this means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would generally mean the input to the program you are writing will come from a file or from input the user types at the command line. If you are not familiar with terminal, this might be a good introduction for this aspect: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal</a></p>

  <p>Basically, what I found was receiving user input was originally done
  via standard input methods (hardware). However, and this is where
  things get complicated, now the process has been abstracted. Instead
  of requiring hardware, now, through something called
  redirection/pipelining, we can modify where the input will come from.</p>

<p>This information you provide here sounds like it comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's article on standard streams</a>. Please reread it, because it does answer your background questions quite well, in particular, reread the headings Background, Application, Standard Input, and Timeline. </p>

<p>To clarify the part about pipelining/redirection a bit, try executing this command from terminal in a directory that contains some known file. Then, try to understand what it does either with Google or using <a href="http://www.linfo.org/man.html" rel="nofollow"><em>man</em></a> (its essentially 'pipelining' the result from a directory listing to grep as input to do a search).</p>

<pre><code>ls | grep &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or try this command and open the resulting file:</p>

<pre><code>ls &gt; listings.txt
</code></pre>

<p>As for your Java specific questions, why not go to the source itself:
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/index.html</a></p>

<p>Also, I would advise you go beyond this and read a little from unix and c perspective with these links:
<a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_input.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.linfo.org/standard_input.html</a>

  <p>Furthermore, when receiving input in the above way, is it worth
  checking for null?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't used Java in sometime, but I'm guessing you won't need to, because you can't get out of the System.in without at least pressing Enter--which would be enough for input. Why not write some code and check it?</p>

<p>For files and network inputs, I would imagine you could have failed transfers and so null is possible here. To handle this type of situation,  you can use a try/catch or something like that. See the docs because you can also use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html" rel="nofollow">try-with-resources</a>.</p>
