<p>I think there is either something wrong with your view definition, or possibly your network permissions. I created a simple jsbin example (<a href="http://jsbin.com/kukoju/1/edit?html,console,output" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/kukoju/1/edit?html,console,output</a>) that I think does essentially what you described and it seems to work fine for me. In attempting to simplify the problem I omitted the use of the XML view and simply directly instantiated the DateTimeInput in javascript. If my jsbin example works for you then I'd recommend you post more of your code so we can see what might need to be changed. If that doesn't work then I suspect you need a local system administrator to help you with the problem.</p>
