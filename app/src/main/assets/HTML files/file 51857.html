<p>No need to reinstall. Just disable the extension by removing the symlink from the <code>conf.d</code> directory. Where the conf.d folder is located depends on your installation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Homebrew: <code>/usr/local/etc/php/5.6/conf.d</code></li>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>/etc/php5/[sapi]/conf.d/</code></li>
</ul>
