<p>The only hints the error gives are the name of the class and that something went terribly wrong during initialization of that class. So either in one of those static initializers, field initialization or maybe in a called constructor.</p>

<p>The second error has been thrown because the class has not been initialized at the time A.getId() was called. The first initialization was aborted. Catching that error was a nice test for the engineering team ;-)</p>

<p>A promising approach to locate such an error is to initialize the class in a test environment and debug the initialization (single steps) code. Then one should be able to find the cause of the problem.</p>
