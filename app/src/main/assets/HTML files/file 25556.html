<p>If your <code>Account_vod__c</code> is a lookup to Account object, you can fetch fields from Account by typing <code>Account_vod__r.Name</code> etc (with "r" instead of "c" and using a dot).</p>

<p>So try with something like this?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Account_vod__c, Account_vod__r.Category__c, Account_vod__r.Segment__c, WEEK_IN_YEAR(Call_Date_vod__c), CALENDAR_YEAR(Call_Date_vod__c)
FROM Call2_vod__c
WHERE Call_Date_vod__c = LAST_N_WEEKS:7
GROUP BY Account_vod__c, Account_vod__r.Category__c, Account_vod__r.Segment__c, WEEK_IN_YEAR(Call_Date_vod__c), CALENDAR_YEAR(Call_Date_vod__c)
</code></pre>

<p>A similar one that should work for everybody who doesn't have your objects:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT AccountId, Account.Name, COUNT(Id) countOfContactsCreatedThatWeek, WEEK_IN_YEAR(CreatedDate) week, CALENDAR_YEAR(CreatedDate) year
FROM Contact
GROUP BY AccountId, Account.Name, WEEK_IN_YEAR(CreatedDate), CALENDAR_YEAR(CreatedDate)
</code></pre>
