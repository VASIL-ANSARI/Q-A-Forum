<p>You don't have to reopen a new group unless you really want to create a new group. So once you open a group, whatever you <em>log</em> will be attached to that group until you close it.</p>

<p>So with your example it would be</p>

<pre><code>console.log('before');

console.groupCollapsed('main');
console.log('test1');
console.log('test2');
console.log('test2');
console.groupEnd();

console.log('after');
</code></pre>

<p>It shouldn't bother you but it takes a bit of a time for the browser to log these in groups. Just an additional note.</p>
