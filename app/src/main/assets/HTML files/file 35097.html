<p>I think your issue is that you are calling <code>json_encode</code> on the <code>$micromarket_participants</code> object, which I don't think that will return what you want.  Instead, try just calling the <code>toJson</code> method on the returned collection:</p>

<pre><code>$json_micromarket_participants = $micromarket_participants-&gt;toJson();
</code></pre>
