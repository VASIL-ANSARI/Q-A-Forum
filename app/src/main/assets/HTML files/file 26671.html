<p>.htaccess should be able to do the trick have a look at: <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond" rel="nofollow">https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond</a>. It would require checking the browser agent unless you have a mobile specific url setup. It would be done something like this.</p>

<pre><code>...
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} *user agent to redirect*
RewriteCond %{URL} *url to redirect from*
RewriteRule specificpage general page
...
</code></pre>

<p>Both the user agent and url are considered regexp. I don't know any other way besides javascript on the page. Also the answer to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3680463/mobile-redirect-using-htaccess">question</a> may be helpful.</p>
