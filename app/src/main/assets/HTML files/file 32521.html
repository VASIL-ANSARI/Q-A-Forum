<p>Turns out the problem was that I'm running both VMWare and, to support Genymotion, VirtualBox.</p>

<p>I discovered this with help from the Genymotion support, who pointed out that when I run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo netstat -nm
</code></pre>

<p>the result is something like:</p>

<pre><code>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface

</code></pre>

<p>I was able to fix this by going into VirtualBox, and from the Network section of the Preferences dialog, I changed every reference to 192.168.56.* in the vboxnet0 configuration to 192.168.57.*.</p>

<p>THANK YOU Genymotion support team!</p>
