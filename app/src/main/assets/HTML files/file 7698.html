<p>Since you're implementing the interface <em>explicitly</em>, you need to cast yourself to the interface:</p>

<pre><code>((IDrilldown)this).Sample1(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you don't like the in-line cast:</p>

<pre><code>IDrilldown idd = (IDrilldown)this;
idd.Sample1(true);
</code></pre>

<p>If you did a normal, implicit implementation, you'd be able to call the method directly.  Explicit interface implementations are only usable on a variable specifically defined as that interface.</p>
