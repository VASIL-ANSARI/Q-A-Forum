<p>You have to give <code>name</code> a size inside the string. Otherwise the compiler doesn't know how large the struct is.</p>

<p>When declaring a variable like</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t myString[] = "Foo";
</code></pre>

<p>the compiler can figure the size out from the size of <code>"Foo"</code>, but if you declare an array without an initial value, <em>you</em> have to tell the size.</p>

<hr>

<p>(The comments question if a <code>uint8_t</code> array can really be initialized with a string. On systems where <code>char</code> is unsigned, <code>uint8_t</code> <em>could</em> be a typedef for <code>char</code>.)</p>
