<p>One thing you could do is actually use some sort of pdf class, and then setup a script (cron job) that could call the page, put the current results into a pdf, and then save it on the server at the time intervals you would like.</p>

<p>The server would execute the script on it's own, and no need to have a browser open. The only problem with that tho is that if you are storing pdfs on the server at a 10 second interval, that's 6 pdfs per minute, x 60 minutes, x 24 hours which would equal over 8k pdfs for a single day.</p>
