<p>This is an expected behavior. Whenever an interpolation expression <code>{{}}</code> is met in html template there is a watch created to track changes in that expression. During a <code>$digest</code> cycle the expression can be evaluated dozens of times.<br>
Never use function calls in interpolation expressions. Only reference properties defined in <code>$scope</code>. In your case it should be something like</p>

<pre><code>$scope.testValue = $scope.test();

{{testValue}}
</code></pre>
