<p>Use multithteading. Since most of the time is actually spent waiting for a response, you can safely create 100 (or even 200) threads, reducing the total time by two orders of magnitude. Use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Executors</code></a> class to create a thread pool and submit one task per each host.</p>

<p>Remember that the <code>serverList</code> collection will then have to be thread safe. Use <code>shutdown()</code> and <code>awaitTermination()</code> pair to wait for results. Alternatively use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletionService.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CompletionService</code></a> to collect results as they arrive.</p>
