<p>Use strstr:</p>

<pre><code>while (*names)
{
    char *next = strstr(names, "\r\n");
    if (next != NULL)
    {
        // If you want to use the key, the length is
        size_t len = next - names;

        // do something with a string here.  The string is not 0 terminated
        // so you need to use only 'len' bytes.  How you do this depends on
        // your need.

        // Have names point to the first character after the \r\n
        names = next + 2;
    }
    else
    {
        // do something with name here.  This version is 0 terminated
        // so it's easy to use

        // Have names point to the terminating \0
        names += strlen(names);
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to note is that this code also fixes an error in your code.  Your string is terminated by a single \0, so the last iteration will have names point to the first byte after your string.  To fix your existing code, you need to change the value of names to:</p>

<pre><code>// The algorithm needs two \0's at the end (one so the final
// strlen will work and the second so that the while loop will
// terminate).  Add one explicitly and allow the compiler to
// add a second one.
char *names = "Name1\0Name2\0Name3\0Name4\0Name5\0";
</code></pre>
