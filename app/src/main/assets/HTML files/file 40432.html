<p>I'm assuming you want to append all of your inputs into your divs and then your divs into the body.</p>

<p>Use the function <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.appendChild" rel="nofollow">appendChild</a>, which is available on all DOM nodes, furthermore, your code will not work since <code>inputVN</code> is undefined.</p>
