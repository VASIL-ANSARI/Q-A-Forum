<p>I guess you have some difficulty expressing your problem here, but the title suggests me you need some kind of client random number generation, don't you?</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="Random Number between 1 and 100" onclick="alert(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:
Ok you edited your request, now it's clear you want it from your database, it wasn't before! You should really explain HOW you generate the number, and what you're looking for is probably an AJAX request, just a guess.</p>
