<p>Firebase is a NoSQL database and as such should not be treated like a normalized SQL database.</p>

<p>To oversimplify you store data in the way you want to retrieve your data, even if that means saving the same data in separate places.</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve a list of workouts, have a workout names object that contains just the workout names (e.g. Heavy chest and arms, Light back and shoulders). Then if you want to retrieve the child elements, do so from another object that matches what you provided in the question.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/guide/structuring-data.html" rel="nofollow">good reading</a> to cement this idea.</p>
