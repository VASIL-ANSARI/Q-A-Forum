<p>You edited your <code>R.java</code> manually. You shouldn't do that really. because actually ADT regenerates that file everytime you insert a new string, xml, .. into your directories. </p>

<p>To solve it maybe you can try to delete the file so the ADT will generate it again for you.</p>

<p>And what is that string <code>Select Image From Gallery</code> in your file? You should really have any strings in that file! That are names in that file. </p>

<p>And string names cannot contain spaces. That causes an error when compiler tries to compile the java file.</p>

<p>If you want to add a string you can go to the <code>values/strings.xml</code> and add the string there. and adt will update the <code>R.java</code> automatically!</p>
