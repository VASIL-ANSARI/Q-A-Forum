<p>After lot of google and debuging i finally found solution and i hope it may help someone.</p>

<p><strong>Actual Problem:</strong> </p>

<p>this problem is less concern to battery but more with Garbage collector which goes crazy after calling socket.disconnect() method.
it cause your app to slow down and drain battery quickly. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>use java-websocket.jar version 1.3.0 instead of websocket.jar to resolve this.</p>

<p><strong>More information:</strong></p>
