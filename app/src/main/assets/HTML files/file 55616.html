<p>You can restrict your MySQL server to listen only for localhost connections with <code>bind-address = 127.0.0.1</code> configuration option as it was suggested in the comments.</p>

<p>If you want to make changes only for this particular user you can check the grants with the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;
</code></pre>

<p>If it is not restricted only to <code>localhost</code> you can restrict it:</p>

<pre><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &lt;username&gt; @'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '&lt;password&gt;';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &lt;username&gt; @'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '&lt;password&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>In general, I would recommend adding a password because you can make some other configuration changes in future or run other apps using the same MySQL server. It is better to be safe than sorry.</p>
