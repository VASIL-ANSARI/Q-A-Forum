<p>Just coding <code>super</code> doesn't call the superclass version of the method.  For calling a superclass method, you can treat the keyword <code>super</code> as if it were an instance of the superclass, calling the method with dot notation:</p>

<pre><code>super.display();
</code></pre>

<p>You can remove the <code>System.out.println</code> from that line, because the superclass method has its own printing statements.</p>
