<p>Your <code>min</code> method seems to work well, maybe there is no number in your array that is less than 0.</p>

<p>This answer is not exactly to make your actual method work but is just a suggestion for a much easier way to do this.</p>

<p>You could use <code>Collections</code> and <code>Commons Lang</code> to find the min/max of an array and to convert a primitive array to a List. </p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import org.apache.commons.lang.ArrayUtils;

public class tst {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 23, 43, 2, 4, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3};

        List lst = Arrays.asList(ArrayUtils.toObject(arr));

        System.out.println(Collections.min(lst));
        System.out.println(Collections.max(lst));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will output <code>min:1</code> and <code>max:43</code>.</p>

<p>This is a good solution to consider if you are not forced to use primitive arrays and do everything by yourself. </p>

<p>Hope it helps :)</p>
