<p>Since you are using SQL Server 2008, you can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177410%28v=sql.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>PIVOT</code></a> function to get the result.  This function will convert your rows of data into columns through the use of an aggregate function.  Since your data is a string, then you will be limited to using either the <code>max</code> or <code>min</code> aggregate functions.</p>

<p>If you have a limited number of columns, then you can hard-code your query.  The basic syntax will be:</p>

<pre><code>select name,
  [father' name], 
  [favorite fruit],
  [first teacher]
from
(
  select q.question,
    a.answer,
    s.name
  from student s
  left join answers a
    on s.student_code = a.student_code
  left join question q
    on a.question_code = q.question_code 
) d
pivot
(
  max(answer)
  for question in ([father' name], [favorite fruit],
                   [first teacher])
) piv;
</code></pre>

<p>But if you have an unknown number of questions, then you will need to use dynamic SQL to generate the result.  This will create a list of the questions that you want to have in the final result and you will create a sql string that will be executed. The code will be similar to:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @cols AS NVARCHAR(MAX),
    @query  AS NVARCHAR(MAX)

select @cols = STUFF((SELECT ',' + QUOTENAME(question) 
                    from question
                    group by question_code, question
                    order by question_code
            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE
            ).value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)') 
        ,1,1,'')

set @query = N'SELECT name, ' + @cols + N' 
            from 
            (
              select q.question,
                a.answer,
                s.name
              from student s
              left join answers a
                on s.student_code = a.student_code
              left join question q
                on a.question_code = q.question_code 
            ) x
            pivot 
            (
                max(answer)
                for question in (' + @cols + N')
            ) p '

execute sp_executesql @query;
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!3/1dee6/8" rel="nofollow">SQL Fiddle with Demo</a>.  Both will give a result:</p>

<pre><code>|  NAME | FATHER' NAME | FAVORITE FRUIT | FIRST TEACHER |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| katia |        katia |         banana |        (null) |
|   ken |       (null) |         (null) |        (null) |
| roger |          ken |         (null) |        (null) |
</code></pre>
