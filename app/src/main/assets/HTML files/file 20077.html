<p>I hope I get your question right.</p>

<p>What you need to do is call your function with the start date, then add seven days to the start date and call your function again... You have to do this until you reach the end date.</p>

<p>Here is some untested code:</p>

<pre><code>$current_date = strtotime($start_date);
$end_date_as_date = strtotime($end_date);

while($current_date &lt; $end_date_as_date){
getWeekDates($current_date);
$current_date= strtotime("+7 day", $current_date);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. If you need any further information leave a comment.</p>
