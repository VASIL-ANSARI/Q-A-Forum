<p>JOINs are not supported for DELETE queries in DQL, because some of the supported RDBMSes don't support it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you must first select the IDs of the elements to delete, then do a <code>DELETE FROM foo WHERE bar IN (?1)</code> and pass the array with the IDs as parameter. </p>

<p>Remember to use an explicit transaction when deleting from multiple tables.</p>

<p>An alternative would be a native query, given that the underlying RDBMS supports JOINs in DELETE queries.</p>
