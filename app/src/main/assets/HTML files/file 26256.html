<p>My guess is that you're getting confused by assertions not being enabled by default. Use the <code>-enableassertions</code> command line option:</p>

<pre><code>java -enableassertions asserttest
</code></pre>

<p>You can also limit assertions to specific packages, and specify packages to <em>disable</em> using <code>-disableassertions</code> too.</p>

<p>Personally I prefer to <em>unconditionally</em> validate parameter values, precisely because of this - I don't like the idea of running the code in a "safe" mode in test, but then letting it loose in production with the safety off. It's like learning to drive with a seatbelt on, but then entering an F1 race without any protection...</p>
