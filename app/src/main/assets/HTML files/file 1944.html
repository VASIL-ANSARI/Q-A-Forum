<p>I presume you are using SQL from within PHP language.</p>

<p>This syntax with <code>{}</code> is used to interpolate array elements embedded in quoted string.</p>

<p>For example, composing the following string:</p>

<pre><code>"Good morning {$_POST['user']} !"
</code></pre>

<p>will compile output with the value of variable (array element) dereferenced, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>"Good morning noname !"
</code></pre>

<p>SQL queries in PHP are composed from strings, so this <code>{}</code> syntax is used fairly often.</p>

<p>p.s. It's always a good idea to provide as many details as possible in your question.</p>
