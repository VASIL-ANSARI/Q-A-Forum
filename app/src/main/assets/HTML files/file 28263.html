<p>Please notice that this line</p>

<pre><code>System.out.print(coins[swap] + ", ");
</code></pre>

<p>displays the already moved (swapped) coin. Maybe you were thinking about displaying <em>the new coin</em> at <code>i</code> index: <code>coins[i]</code> (which wouldn't be correct anyway, as the already displayed coin still can be swapped in the next iterations). Probably it's better to create a second <code>for</code> loop to display final coin values.</p>

<p>But this isn't only problem here. To randomly shuffle an array you should use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="nofollow">Fisher-Yates</a> algorithm which is slightly different than your method. You can find Java implementation of this algorithm on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519736/random-shuffling-of-an-array">SO</a>.</p>

<p>If you had a <code>List&lt;Coin&gt;</code> instead of <code>Coin[]</code> (list instead of array) you could use the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#shuffle%28java.util.List%29" rel="nofollow"><code>Collections.shuffle</code></a> method and be sure that the algorithm is correct and you'll always get random result.</p>
