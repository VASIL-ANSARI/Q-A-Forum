<p>Various programs, including IDLE, sometimes ask the computer to 'beep' when the user does something that the program considers an error.  In general, to not hear a beep, you can 1) stop doing whatever provokes the beep, 2) turn your speaker down or off, or 3) plug in earphones and not wear them while editing.</p>
