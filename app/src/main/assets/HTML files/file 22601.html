<p>You simply add it in the anchor tag.</p>

<pre><code>array_unshift( $action_links, "&lt;a href=\"" . STT_OPTIONS_URL . "\" alt=\"Alt text Here\"&gt;" . __( 
   'Settings', 'scrollto-top' ) . "&lt;/a&gt;" );
</code></pre>

<p>However if you want this to work cross browser you will need to provide the <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The alt text is alternative text for the image when the image either cant be loaded or the user is using a screen reader. The title text is intended as the tooltip. However not all browsers see it this way so including both should work in all browsers</p>
