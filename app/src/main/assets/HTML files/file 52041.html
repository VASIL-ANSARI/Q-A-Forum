<p>You should not rely on user agent, it is sent by the client, it can be defined by the user in the browser, the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17801135/2257664">cURL</a> client, etc. One user who would like to increase this counter may perform an infinite number of requests with random user agents, even from the same IP address, and fill your database with fake data.</p>

<p>For example it can be done with a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/" rel="nofollow">Firefox add-on</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I suggest to use only the IP address in order to distinguish visitors. It's much harder to change the IP address (using a VPN is not easy) than change the user agent. The numbers will be close to the number of actual visitors.</p>
