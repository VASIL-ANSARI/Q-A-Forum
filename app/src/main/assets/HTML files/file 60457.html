<p>solution 1) use -static (full libraries) or compile-in only libstdc++ as static to the binary</p>

<p>solution 2) distribute the appropriate libstdc++ version with the binary (possibly using LD_PRELOAD)</p>

<p>solution 3) use exactly the same g++ libstdc++ version for crosscompiling (at least matching)</p>

<p>usually better is to use solution 1) - you will have no problems across distros upgrade</p>
