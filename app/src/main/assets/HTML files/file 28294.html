<p>Remove the second function() so it has no exit hover function.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.hover').hover(function(){
        $('.techinfo').fadeIn(500)
    })
})
</code></pre>

<p>The second function is run whenever you stop hovering the image, so removing it will stop that occurring and the div will stay shown.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I didn't fully read the question, Chris Kempen's answer is more inline with what was being asked.</p>
