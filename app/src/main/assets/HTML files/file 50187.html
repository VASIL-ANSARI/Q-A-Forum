<p>To do this, you'll need to loop through both objects and count the matches.</p>

<pre><code>$cnt = 0;
foreach($products as $pkey=&gt;$pobj) {
    foreach($carts as $ckey=&gt;$cobj) {
        if($cobj-&gt;chemID == $pobj-&gt;barrels-&gt;chemID &amp;&amp; $cobj-&gt;catID == $pobj-&gt;barrels-&gt;catID) {
          $cnt++;
        }
    }
}
echo 'Count of matches: ' . $cnt;
</code></pre>
