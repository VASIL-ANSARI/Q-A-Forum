<p>The problem I found is that inside <em>keystone.js</em> the method <code>keystone.init()</code> is expecting a <em>String</em> instead of and <em>Array</em>.  Change the line that reads <code>'views': ['templates', 'templates/views'],</code> to <code>'views': 'templates/views',</code>.  Hope this fixes your issue.  </p>
