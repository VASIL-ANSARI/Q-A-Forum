<p>It cannot be helped, the completion handler indeed won't be called because there is no score entry in the leaderboards. Although I still don't understand why doesn't it just return an error saying so.</p>

<p>Since the custom friend list just shows statistics, I just put a loading icon in place for each statistic. If the handler is not called for more than 10 seconds, I assume that there is no score entry and just display a 0.</p>
