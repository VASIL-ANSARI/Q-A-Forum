<p>Frankly I have not understood everything that you want to achieve here. But you should consider the sequence of events. See my comments: </p>

<pre><code>  if (self.loginView)
  {
    self.loginView = nil;
    //self.loginView is nil now. What so you think doese happen on the next line? 
    self.loginView.delegate = nil;
    // change the sequence of this lines and it will be ok. 
  }

  LoginView *loginPage = [[LoginView alloc]initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
  [loginPage setDelegate:self];

  self.loginView = loginPage;

  [loginPage release]; //here you release the object. it is gone now. However, there are still references to it. 

  [self.view addSubview:self.loginView]; // here you add the released object. What do you expect to happen? 
  // Switch those two statmetns and you should be fine. 
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it may even work as those statmens are next to each other. And when you remove it from its super view it gets released again. And there your app might crash. </p>

<p>BTW, without having it retained you should not release it at all. Or am I wrong here? However, addSubview should retain it and removeFromSuperview will release it, so no additional release would be required. Onece removed it should be gone. (If not retained somewhere else) </p>
