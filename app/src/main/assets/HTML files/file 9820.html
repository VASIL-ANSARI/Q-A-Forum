<p>The error is <code>ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.</code>. Usually it means something is missing in your system. Ruby development libraries or a dependency of the gem. In this particular case i think libevent (its a dependency of eventmachine) is not in your system.</p>

<p>You will find a complete description of what went wrong at:
<code>/www/&lt;hostname&gt;/.gems/gems/eventmachine-0.12.10/ext/gem_make.out</code></p>
