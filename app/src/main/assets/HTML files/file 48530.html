<p>A little-known use for breakpoints is to use them as bookmarks for your code. I use them to quickly navigate to pieces of my code that I revisit a lot. 
Just create a breakpoint as you would normally (click the gutter to the left of a line of code) and then disable it by right-clicking on it and selecting "Disable Breakpoint". You can display all the breakpoints by bringing up the Breakpoint Navigator with this hotkey:  </p>

<p>â7 : Breakpoint Navigator </p>

<p>or just click on the breakpoint icon in the navigation bar on the left-hand side

<p>Clicking on the breakpoint in the navigator will instantly take you to that line of code just like a bookmark.</p>

<p>Just remember to make sure they are disabled and light blue in colour otherwise they will cause your program to halt at that breakpoint.</p>
