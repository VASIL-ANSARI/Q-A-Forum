<p>I suppose that your system don't have MinGW compiler!! If that's the case, download it by visiting their site. If you have already done that, the only thing I can think of is that you have not edited the path variable value in your system properties.</p>

<p>For this, follow these simple steps : </p>

<ol>
<li>Go to "My Computer" or "This PC" or whatever name you have given to it.</li>
<li>Right click and select "Properties".</li>
<li>Click on "Advanced system settings" present on left hand side.</li>
<li>Click on "Environment Variables" present at the bottom under "Advanced" tab in the "System      Properties"</li>
<li>Select the "Path" variable in the "System variables" and select the "Edit" option.</li>
<li><p>At the end of the contents written in "Variable Value", add this </p>

<p>;C:\MinGW\bin</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and your .c files should compile and run.</p>
