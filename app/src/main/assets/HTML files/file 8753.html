<p>It sounds like you need an iframe per file upload.  So what I would do is have hidden fields for every other field in your normal form (in each iframe).  Then when you click the submit button, you take all the visible fields and place the values in the corresponding hidden fields for each image.  Then call post on each iframe now that they all have the data they need.</p>
