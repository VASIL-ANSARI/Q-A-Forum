<p>Pantomime is too big and not well documented. You can try:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mronge.com/m/MailCore/API/" rel="nofollow">MailCore</a> (it works, check how are you including it)</li>
<li>libetpan, plain c, low level, it's the underlying library in MailCore (last time I checked)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ccgus/letters" rel="nofollow">letters</a>, Cocoa, IIRC requires blocks</li>
</ul>
