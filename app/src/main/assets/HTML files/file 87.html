<p>I don't think there are hard and fast rules for this type of thing, but I usually go by the guideline of using the lightest possible way until absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have a <code>Person</code> class and a <code>Group</code> class. A <code>Group</code> instance has many people, so a List here would make sense. When I declare the list object in <code>Group</code> I will use an <code>IList&lt;Person&gt;</code> and instantiate it as a <code>List</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Group {
  private IList&lt;Person&gt; people;

  public Group() {
    this.people = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, if you don't even need everything in <code>IList</code> you can always use <code>IEnumerable</code> too. With modern compilers and processors, I don't think there is really any speed difference, so this is more just a matter of style.</p>
