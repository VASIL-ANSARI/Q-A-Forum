<p>I don't know if anything of the following solves your problem, but ...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>why does your "working" handler of the CheckedChanged has the wrong signature? It needs the sender and the eventsargs.</p>

<p><code>protected Sub AssignElegibility(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Why do you iterate the Gridrows to get the Checkbox and the row that has changed? This works also:</p>

<p><code>Dim checkbox As CheckBox = DirectCast(sender,CheckBox)</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>To get the Row you only have to cast the NamingContainer of your Checkbox to GridViewRow.</p>

<p><code>Dim row as GridViewRow =DirectCast(checkbox.NamingContainer,GridViewRow)</code></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Do you rebind the ElegibilitySelectedGridview-Grid on Postback?
You should only do that when <code>not Page.IsPostback</code>, otherwise events won't fire.</p>
