<p>So I wasn't clearly reading the error message in detail. I was missing out exclamation marks because I copied and pasted the UIApplicationDelegate swift generated headers. I should have entered:</p>

<pre><code>override func application(application: UIApplication!, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>Command clicking on UIApplication delegate does show:</p>

<pre><code>protocol UIApplicationDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {
... 
optional func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject : AnyObject]) -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. without the '!'s</p>
