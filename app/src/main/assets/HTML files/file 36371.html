<p>You are pulling by the amount?  How can you be sure you're even getting the correct record?  What you should be doing is pulling the record you need by a unique ID, like a user ID or something.  Then pull the amount from THAT.  Us PHP to write a simple if statement to see if it is >, =, or &lt; whatever was entered.</p>

<p>In response to comment...
Your syntax is still wrong.  if you are trying to see if the FULL is populated and the same, that's one part.  Then you want to see if that also happens to be within a range.
This is what it should look like:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE full='".$full."' and full BETWEEN 1 AND 1,000,000"; 
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do this same thing but check against a balance, you don't need to match anything.  All you need to do is take the input and compare it to the balance.  So, ignoring your syntax, this is what your statement should look like.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT CASE WHEN ".$full." &lt; [balance] THEN 'sufficient funds'
 WHEN ".$full." &gt; [balance] THEN 'insufficient funds'
END AS 'result', [balance]
 FROM transfers
</code></pre>

<p>With that, you are checking the input amount for the possible results (add as many as you need), and returning the current balance you just checked against.</p>
