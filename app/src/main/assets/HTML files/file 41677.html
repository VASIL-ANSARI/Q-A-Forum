<p>You should respect Swing's threading policy and have the GUI initialized on the GUI thread:</p>

<pre><code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; new OpacityBug());
</code></pre>

<p>I can't tell whether this is all it will take to correct the behavior on your side, but it has done just that on mine (OS X).</p>
