<p>I didn't get that method working but I did get email sending through SES from php using the php PEAR package's MAIL extension. In the AWS dashoard you can setup your SES account to use SMTP authentication, so I did that and now SES lets me send mail as expected via smtp.</p>

<p>Hope this saves someone else out there some hours and headaches</p>
