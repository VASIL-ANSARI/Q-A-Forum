<p>Have you tried overriding the </p>

<pre><code>public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev)
</code></pre>

<p>This method is inherited from the activity, so you should have access to it. </p>

<p>You didn't post any source code, so I can tell for sure that it'll work. Please try and let us know.</p>
