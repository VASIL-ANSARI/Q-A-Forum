<p>You're using a relative path, <code>../etc...</code> in your include, which means the path being checked is RELATIVE to the location of the script you're running the include directive from.</p>

<p>That means, assuming your document root is <code>/var/www/site/html</code></p>

<pre><code>/var/www/site/html/index.php           -&gt; /var/www/site/~13097377/include/head.html
/var/www/site/html/contact/contact.php -&gt; /var/www/site/html/~13097377/include/head.html
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you have a <code>~13097377</code> directory in BOTH your doc_root and doc_root/contact directories, this is why you get your errors. You're telling PHP to look for your file in a place that doesn't exist.</p>
