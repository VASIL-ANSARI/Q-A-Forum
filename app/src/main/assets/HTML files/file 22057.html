<p>So, I think I've found the answer. It's everything right on the code above. But I also had some 'script' line where I've added another jQuery library. When I deleted this line everything started work.
I found this mistake by analyzing the code and resources of this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/jquery-text-change-custom-event" rel="nofollow">http://www.zurb.com/playground/jquery-text-change-custom-event</a></p>

<p>(just download everything, and comment each line while found something which may cause the bug, but didn't found)
So, now everything works. The only advice I can give to someone with the mistakes like this is to be more attentive to your code:)</p>
