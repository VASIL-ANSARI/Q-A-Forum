  <p>Is this proverbially bad? What limitations does this have?</p>

<p>Global variables tend to impose a certain set of restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>they often don't clean up their resources properly</li>
<li>are not thread safe (e.g. can be used from one thread or may introduce state per thread)</li>
<li>they may not necessarily be safe to nest</li>
<li>they can combat some of these problems by serializing requests -- introducing excessive suspension and locking.</li>
<li>they become very difficult to 'extend' safely (i.e. adding global variables makes it more fragile)</li>
<li>they are hard to test, and can lead to bugs which are very difficult to reproduce</li>
</ul>

  <p>What are the alternatives, and what is best?</p>

<p>Just move those variables to ivars, and create instances of the class rather than relying on global state. Then you can extend and abstract in a way which will not affect your clients significantly.</p>

<p>Note that <code>static NSString* const url = @"http://local.namehidden.com:90/json.html";</code> would not be a mutable variable (added <code>const</code>). So it's only <code>_configData</code> and <code>try</code> which would need to be ivars.</p>
