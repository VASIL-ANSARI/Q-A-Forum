<p>You don't need to use quotes when binding a parameter to the query:</p>

<pre><code>query = db.GqlQuery("SELECT * FROM EmailDatabase WHERE emailaddress = :1", self.request.get('emailaddress'))
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise it will read it as a string and actually only return objects that have <code>:1</code> as their emailaddress value.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you validate the user input (<code>self.request.get('emailaddress')</code>) before inserting it into the query.</p>
