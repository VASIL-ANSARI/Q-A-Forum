<p>All right, I'll answer my own question to sum things up. 
Thanks to Darek Rossman, I've found some interesting links. The main point is that position fixed is gradually gaining more support on tablets, so it's a matter of time before this problem isn't a problem anymore. The workaround that seems to work for me is using the javascript solution Darek Rossman mentioned in his first comment. However javascript is still not working flawless on some tablets. Until better times arrive, I'll use a different stylesheet for tablets (using media queries). Special thanks to Darek Rossman who posted the interesting stuff!</p>
