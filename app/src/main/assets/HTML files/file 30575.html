<p>That's the sort of thing I would expect from something trying to read a four-byte float as an eight-byte double, with the other four bytes being ... well, whatever.  This really shouldn't work, but if you put an explicit cast <code>(double)flt_var</code> as the third parameter, does that help?</p>
