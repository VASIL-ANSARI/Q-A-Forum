<p>This should do what you're looking for. It will do a DNS lookup on the hostname of the website, which should give you the IP Address that it is listening on.</p>

<pre><code>string dnsHostname = "yourwebsite.com";
IPAddress[] addresslist = Dns.GetHostAddresses(dnsHostname);

foreach (IPAddress theaddress in addresslist)
{
   Console.WriteLine(theaddress.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will likely only need the first result of the array.</p>
