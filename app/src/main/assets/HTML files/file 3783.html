<p>This had bothered me in the past, but I shelved it until I saw your question.  The <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/zigen/home/plugin/dbviewer/about_en.html" rel="nofollow">DBViewer</a> plug-in seems to do a fairly decent job of this, but I only tested it with basic SQL.  For example, it will transform </p>

<pre><code>select * from urbase order by foo;
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
        *
    FROM
        urbase
    ORDER BY
        foo
</code></pre>

<p>This does the best job out of any that I tested, although there might be better plug-ins out there.</p>
