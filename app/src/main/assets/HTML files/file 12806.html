<p>It's a matter of preference. For example, <code>DateTime</code> throws an exception in its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z2xf7zzk.aspx" rel="nofollow">constructor</a>. If you'd rather not, you could use a static method like <code>Build(Calibration calibration)</code>. A good practice is to use XML comments to let users of your type know that the constructor throws an exception in an <code>&lt;exception&gt;</code> tag.</p>
