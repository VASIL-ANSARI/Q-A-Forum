<p>It looks like you're  </p>

<ol>
<li>appending a bunch of redundant frames to your video, </li>
<li>labouring under a misapprehension: that video files must have a constant framerate that is high, e.g. 30fps.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you're showing a slideshow of 3 images over a duration of 15 seconds, then you <em>need only output 3 images</em>, with presentation timestamps of 0s, 5s, 10s  and an <code>assetWriter.endSession(atSourceTime:</code>) of 15s, not 15s * 30 FPS = 450 frames . </p>

<p>In other words, your frame rate is <em>way too high</em> - for the best interframe compression money can buy, lower your frame rate to the bare minimum number of frames you need and all will be well<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p><sup>*<sub>I've seen some video services/players choke on unusually low framerates,<br>
so you may need a minimum framerate and <em>some</em> redundant frames,   e.g. 1frame/5s, ymmv</sub></sup></p>
