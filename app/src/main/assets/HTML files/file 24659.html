<p>The <code>CountDownTimer</code> is still active even if the activity onDestroy() is called and <code>forSend()</code> would be called in <code>onFinish()</code>; Just put a log in onTick and you will see. However if you kill the app then the process would be killed and the CountDownTimer would also be killed.</p>
