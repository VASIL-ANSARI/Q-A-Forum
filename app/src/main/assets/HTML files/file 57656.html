<p>For me, it's more a matter of electronic. </p>

<p>In fact, for that kind of library, <strong>we can assume that the functions work correctly</strong> (I suppose that you wrote correct code that was built like that: <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/buttons_and_switches/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/buttons_and_switches/</a>). </p>

<p>I believe that the electronic problem can come from several sources: </p>

<ul>
<li>Either your <strong>ground is badly connected</strong> (or it's not the same for the arduino and the rasperry pi). So, the reference tension isn't the same and a 0V for the arduino can be 1V for the raspberry pi. </li>
<li><p>It can also be a result of a bad interpretation of when your circuit is on and off. <strong>Don't forget that to put a plain 0V in the input of the raspberry pi</strong> (when the circuit is off). You need to explicitly write 0V at the output of the arduino (I mean: <code>digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);</code>) otherwise your pin would not be "grounded" but "floating" and the tension can fluctuate from any value (close to 0) to another depending on environmental factors. 
(to achieve it, you can also use pull down resistances, see: <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/CommonTopics/PullUpDownResistor" rel="nofollow">http://playground.arduino.cc/CommonTopics/PullUpDownResistor</a>). </p></li>
<li><p>It can also be a <strong>transient phenomenon</strong> due to unwanted capacitive reactions. So, when your current changes quickly, the circuit cannot follow it instantaneously and it will produce some voltage glitches. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest <strong>checking the two first points</strong>. If it cannot solve your problem, it should be related to the second point and you could handle it with capacitors and wait times. </p>

<p>I hope it will help :)</p>
