<p>I had the same problem and found the solution by setting the protocol to 'mail' (of course this is not the case that always you need to use "mail" as protocol, I used "smtp" as protocol in another website, and was working fine, but the same code I copied and pasted for some other website and did not work, so I had to change it to 'mail'). My sample configuration looks like this(replace uppercase words with your own credentials):</p>

<pre><code>'protocol' =&gt; 'mail',            
'smtp_host' =&gt; 'mail.YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN.com.au',            
'smtp_port' =&gt; 25,            
'smtp_user' =&gt; 'YOUR_EMAIL_ACCOUNT@YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN.com.au',            
'smtp_pass' =&gt; 'YOUR_PASSWORD_FOR_YOUR_EMAIL_ACCOUNT',            
'smtp_timeout' =&gt; 5,// The default value            
'mailtype' =&gt; 'html' //default: text        
</code></pre>
