<p>According to the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>data</h2>
  
  <p>Type: PlainObject or String or Array</p>
  
  <p>Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if
  not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See
  processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must
  be Key/Value pairs. If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple
  values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting
  (described below).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in other words, although <code>data</code> accepts a string, that string has to be in a JSON format.</p>

<p>Something like this would work better:</p>

<pre><code>var DATA = { date: 'date=' + date };
</code></pre>
