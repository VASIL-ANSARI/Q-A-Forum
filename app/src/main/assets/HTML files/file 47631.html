<p>RippleDrawable added in API Level 21 and unfortunately,This is not yet part of support library. It will most likely show up in future update, but there's no time frame announced.</p>

<p>Luckily there are few custom implementations already available:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/traex/RippleEffect
https://github.com/balysv/material-ripple
https://github.com/siriscac/RippleView
https://github.com/ozodrukh/RippleDrawable
</code></pre>

<p>including Materlial themed widget sets compatible with older versions of Android:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/keithellis/MaterialWidget
</code></pre>

<p>so you can try one of these or google for other "material widgets". </p>
