<p>You cannot set <code>height:100%;</code> on an element if the parent hasn't a set height.</p>

But as you said, you tried to use JavaScript, so I assume this should be what you're looking for : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4926297/1561269">Answer to the same kind of question</a> (Have a look at its fiddle.)
Seemingly, you won't have the choice.</p>
