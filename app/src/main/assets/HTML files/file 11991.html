<p>You should use a <code>ModifyListener</code> instead and query the current value of the combo's text box like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void modifyText(ModifyEvent e)
{
  String text = ((Combo) e.getSource()).getText();
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this will only give you the content of the text box. The combo viewer won't have - as far as I remember - any selection until you select an element from its drop down list or you programmatically set one using <code>setSelection(..)</code>. The visible text is basically only the label (as far the the combo viewer is concerned) and since labels don't have to be unique, it won't try to find the model element that belongs to the label. So I don't know what you expect the combo viewer's selection to be while someone is typing in the combo's text box. What kind of behaviour exactly are you trying to achieve?</p>
