<p>This issue was happened because of wrong format of JSON passing. Then i changed the parameter as follows </p>

<pre><code>let parameters = ["payment":["amount": "100" , "payment_method": "check", "date": "2015-11-25", "details": "Payment description dimuth Lasantha"]]
</code></pre>

<p>Now it passes the correct format which is </p>

<pre><code>{
payment: {
    "amount" : "100",
    "payment_method" : "check",
     .....
    }
}
</code></pre>
