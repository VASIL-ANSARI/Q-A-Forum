<p>Hint for the future - there is no need to reboot. Enable X kill sequence (usually ctrl-alt-backspace, but disabled by default in modern distros, you have to enable it manually) as last resort, but usually it is just ctrl-alt-f1, login to tty, kill offending process, then return back to X with ctrl-alt-fN (the number of tty where X sits, most often 7). If you're working with graphics you probably will need that sooner or later.</p>

<p>Not sure if your problem was exactly the same as I've seen when running your program, but it is very likely so. You display FPS in window title, sending it to window manager on each frame, 15 thousands times per second. Window manager gets confused by so many window title updates (at least openbox does. Haven't tested with different WMs). Not sure if it will eventually flush accumulated changes or just hang forever; didn't wait.</p>

<p>Basically don't update window title more often than 10 times per second.</p>
