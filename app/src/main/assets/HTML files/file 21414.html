<p>I would suggest using a sub-query as opposed to looping. More efficient that way. This may not be exact but something like...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    *
FROM
(      
SELECT
    customer.customer_id,
    service.service_RecID,
    Resource.Date_Time_Start,
    Recurrence.Recurrence_RecID,
    RecurType,
    RecurInterval,
    DaysOfWeek,
    AbsDayNbr,
    SelectInterval,
    NextAppointmentDate=
    CASE 
        WHEN RecurType='m' THEN DATEADD(MONTH,RecurInterval,Resource.Date_Time_Start)
        WHEN RecurType='y' THEN DATEADD(YEAR,RecurInterval,Resource.Date_Time_Start)
    ELSE 
        NULL
    END        
FROM
    Recurrence
    INNER JOIN Resource ON Resource.Recurrence_RecID=Recurrence.Recurrence_RecID
    INNER JOIN service ON service.service_RecID=Resource.service_RecID
    INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_ID=service.customerID
)AS X
WHERE
    NextAppointmentDate&gt;=GETDATE()
ORDER BY Fields...
</code></pre>
