<p>You are getting this error because of dynamic IDs.  The ID of an element is different every time you open the page.  I really need to see the HTML of the page you are trying to interact with...but I'll try to write you a selector anyways.</p>

<p>On the line that fails, you have to rewrite your selector to: <code>css = "*[id^="id"] &gt; span"</code></p>

<p>I don't think that the above will work, because it will select more than the element you want...and if it doesn't, please post the HTML of the element you want to select (plus surrounding HTML), or read up on CSS yourself.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you wanted to select the "Camping Sites" link, you could either do it by link text, or with the following selector:  <code>css = .tab1 span</code></p>
