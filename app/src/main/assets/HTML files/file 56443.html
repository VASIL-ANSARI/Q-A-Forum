<p>Apparently the ".title" references an actual column in their example.
When I used <code>hit.doc.FIRSTTAG</code>, FIRSTTAG being a column in MY NoSQL-db it worked.
Still does not explain the missing method, but I am happy with it for now.</p>

<p>So to anyone having the same problem:</p>

<p>Use your own columns names when evaluating the response object e.g. in my example:</p>

<pre><code>for hit in response:
  print(hit.doc.FIRSTTAG)
</code></pre>
