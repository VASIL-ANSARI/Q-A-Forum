<p>This Part of the code shouldnt be written into your main() function.</p>

<pre><code>// the file is passed to this function
void fileinfo1(string filename) {

    //the user will input a link e.g www.espn.com
    cout &lt;&lt; "What is the link name? ";

    cin &gt;&gt; Link_Name;

    // and also input date range (start-end)
    cout &lt;&lt; "What is the starting date? " ;

    cin &gt;&gt; Date_Accessed;

    cout &lt;&lt; "What is the ending date? " ;

    cin &gt;&gt; Date_Accessed;

    // Now, here's where I'm having trouble

    // I need to find the wwww.espn.com in my file based on the range date , so that i will be able to increment the number of hits

    unsigned int curLine = 0;
    while (getline(filename, line)) { // I changed this, see below
        curLine++;
        if (line.find(search, 0) != string::npos) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "found: " &lt;&lt; search &lt;&lt; "line: " &lt;&lt; curLine &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>and you are using way to many global variables which are really not necessary. And you dident declare the variables line and search. This shoudnt even compile.</p>
