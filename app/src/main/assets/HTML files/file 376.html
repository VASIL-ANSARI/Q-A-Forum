<p>You want <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb856484(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">ComboBox_SetCurSel</a>:</p>

<pre><code>ComboBox_SetCurSel(hWndCombo, n);
</code></pre>

<p>or if it's an MFC CComboBox control you can probably do:</p>

<pre><code>m_combo.SetCurSel(2);
</code></pre>

<p>I would imagine if you're doing it manually you would also want SendMessage rather than PostMessage. CBN_SELCHANGE is the notification that the control sends <em>back to you</em> when the selection is changed.</p>

<p>Finally, you might want to add the c++ tag to this question.</p>
