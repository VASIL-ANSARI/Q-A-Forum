<p>(assuming that this code snippet is an entire query)</p>

<p>May be wrong but your statement does not have a SELECT ... in short it looks like this:</p>

<p>t1 JOIN t2 WHERE ...</p>

<p>There is no SELECT something FROM t1 JOIN t2 WHERE ...</p>

<p>Not sure if I make myself clear...</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>Not sure what you re trying to achieve, but this code bellow returns random IDs from your tables (variation of your query) so perhaps you can use it. A bit messy perhaps but then again I have no idea what are you trying to achieve :).</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM 
  (SELECT table1.id as id1 
    FROM table1 
    INNER JOIN table2 
    ON table1.id = table2.id)  as t1
JOIN (
  (SELECT ROUND(RAND() * (SELECT MAX(table1.id) FROM table1)) AS id2) 
AS t2 )
WHERE t1.id1 &gt;= t2.id2
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can select id1 or id2 instead of *, depending on what is your goal...</p>
