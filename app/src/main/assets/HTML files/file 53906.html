<p>As I understand, antiword is not a python module that you can import. It's an executable that can be run directly from the command prompt (cmd).
I installed antiword as explained in <a href="http://www-stud.rbi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~markus/antiword/00README.WIN" rel="nofollow">00README.WIN document</a> and could run it in cmd after adding its folder to PATH environment variable as well as creating a HOME environment variable exactly as outlined in README. I could successfully run the following example using testdoc.doc found in antiword\Doc\</p>

<pre><code>antiword -m cp852.txt filename.doc &gt; filename.txt
</code></pre>

<p>I think if you need to do this in Python, you can run antiword similar to any cmd command as previously <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14894993/running-windows-shell-commands-with-python">explained</a>.
The same thing was previously <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/125222/extracting-text-from-ms-word-files-in-python">suggested</a>. You could also give IronPython a try as previuosly <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">recommended</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
