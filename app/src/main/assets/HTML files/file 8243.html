<p>It seems like you are confused between two different things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Having the jar on your classpath when compiling your own classes.</li>
<li>Having the jar available at runtime</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use Eclipse for Java EE developers (see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>) and create a dynamic web project instead of a regular java project, then jars placed into WEB-INF/lib will automatically be added to the classpath for compilation, and will also be added to the WAR archive that will be deployed to Tomcat.</p>
