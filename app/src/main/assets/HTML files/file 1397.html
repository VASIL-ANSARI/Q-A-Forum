<p>Yes, you're right. To reuse the the second part of the execution plan you need to split the first statement into 2 separate execution plans. You can do this either by executing them with separate <code>MSSqlCommand.Execute</code> calls or by using two calls to <code>sp_executesql</code> in one query (this adds one level of indirection). It would look something like this (in pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>MSSqlCommand.Execute('exec sp_executesql stmt1; exec sp_executesql stmt2");
</code></pre>
