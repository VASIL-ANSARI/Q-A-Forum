<p>You can try this:</p>

<pre><code>select count(*) as TotalValues
  , (select count(*) from test where id in(1, 3)) as TotalGood
  , (select count(*) from test where id not in (1, 3)) as TotalFailed
from test
</code></pre>

<p>Based on your comment, if you need the percentage you would use this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TotalValues
  , TotalGood
  , TotalFailed
  , Cast(TotalGood as decimal(10, 2))/Cast(TotalValues as decimal(10, 2)) as PercentGood
FROM 
(
  select count(*) as TotalValues
    , (select count(*) from test where id in(1, 3)) as TotalGood
    , (select count(*) from test where id not in (1, 3)) as TotalFailed
  from test
) x
</code></pre>
