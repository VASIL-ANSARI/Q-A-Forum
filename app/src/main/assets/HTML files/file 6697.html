<p>Small remarks to improve the design :
1) Use shared_ptr instead of raw pointers
2) use std::string instead of char*</p>

<p>You have to cast, because types Creator, Creator and Creator&lt; DerivedB > are completely different types. The way to fix that is to remove casts :</p>

<pre><code>//Register
Factory&lt;Base, char*&gt; temp;
temp.Register("DA", new DerivedCreator&lt;Base&gt;);
temp.Register("DB", new DerivedCreator&lt;Base&gt;);
</code></pre>
