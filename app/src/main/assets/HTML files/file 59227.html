<p>Instead of re-doing something like this, why not try something that works?  In doing something very similar to what you want to do, I used the <a href="https://blueimp.github.io/Gallery/" rel="nofollow">Blueimp gallery</a>.  It was simple to set up, and the previous / next buttons work, including using the arrow keys and on mobile.</p>
