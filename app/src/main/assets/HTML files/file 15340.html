<p>Since you're allocating raw memory, a closer equivalent would be:</p>

<pre><code>void *mem = operator new(sizeof(T));
T *myobj = new(mem) T();

// ...

myobj-&gt;~T();
operator delete(mem);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you've overloaded <code>::operator new</code> for a particular class, this will use that class' <code>operator new</code>, where yours using <code>new char []</code> would ignore it.</p>

<p>Edit: though I should add that I'm ignoring the possibility of exceptions here. @Mankarse's answer seems (to me) to cover that part fairly well.</p>
