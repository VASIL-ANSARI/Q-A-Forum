<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the old cyanogen tethering app (android 1.6, before tethering was officially offered) create an ad-hoc network for the tether clients?   (I ended up using it not to tether, but just to set up a network so I could ssh into the phone from a laptop while I was playing around with USB host drivers and so couldn't use ADB.)</p>
