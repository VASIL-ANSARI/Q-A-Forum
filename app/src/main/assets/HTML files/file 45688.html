<p>First off, make sure that you aren't running anything like <code>Application.RequestUserAuthorization(UserAuthorization.Microphone)</code> anywhere.</p>

<p>Second, according to <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/589261/my-ios-app-doesnt-use-the-mic-but-the-app-asks-for.html" rel="nofollow">this guy on the Unity forums</a>, the only way to permanently disable asking for microphone permissions is by unchecking the <code>Prepare iOS for Recording</code> box in XCode and renaming the game.  I believe that the renaming portion only applies if you have submitted to Apple, in which case you would have to do a factory reset on your device (or just rename), but I cannot be completely sure.</p>
