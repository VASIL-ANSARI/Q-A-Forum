<p>Well if your Service is already running and you try to start service again, there will be no new instance created for the Service it will consider the previous running instance only. So, there is nothing to worry in that case. If you call the Service while its running its <code>onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)</code> will be called and not <code>onCreate()</code>.</p>
