<p>What your program lacks is the "is the number not divisible by 13" check.</p>

<p>Remember, when you write an <code>if</code> statement, whatever is in its corresponding block will only be executed if the expression between the parenthesis is true. So <strong>inside</strong> your while loop, write an <code>if</code> statement, and only print the number if it is not divisible by 13. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (x &lt;= 1000) // notice the &lt;= operator
{
    if (/*change this multiline comment for an expression
        that checks wheter x is not divisible by 13*/) {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
    x++; // Increment x whether it is divisible or not.
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would write the actual expression there, but then I'd be answering your homework for you. I just wish you get the logic for this, so you can then answer your homework by yourself - and internalize the knowledge. May it be that this is useful for you.</p>
