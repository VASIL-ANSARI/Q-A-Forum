<p>The launching of your keyboard seems to be "normal" from the gif files you have provided. However assuming if it is slow, maybe you could try this if it does load faster. </p>

<p>Just to mention I've not tried this code and typing off from here.</p>

<p>For slow display of keyboard.</p>

<pre><code>textField.placeholder = "Out of"
textField.keyboardType = .NumberPad
textField.becomeFirstResponder()
</code></pre>

<p>For slow hiding of keyboard.</p>

<pre><code>alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .Cancel, handler: {
            (alert: UIAlertAction) in
       self.view.endEditing(true)
}))
</code></pre>
