<p>Found my mistake. It was very silly. I did not make the auth token into a string (wrapped it with ""). Also, you may get an error like </p>

<pre><code>Faraday::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
</code></pre>

<p>but to fix that, I just did this in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>rvm osx-ssl-certs status all
rvm osx-ssl-certs update all
</code></pre>
