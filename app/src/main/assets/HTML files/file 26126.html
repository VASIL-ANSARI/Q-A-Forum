<p>This solved my problem </p>

<pre><code>   key = ''
    for physical_disk in w.Win32_DiskDrive():
    logical_disks = []
    for partition in physical_disk.associators ("Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition"):
        for logical_disk in partition.associators ("Win32_LogicalDiskToPartition"):
            key = logical_disk.Description
            if key not in all_logical_disks:
                all_logical_disks[key] = []
            logical_disks.append(logical_disk.Caption)
    if logical_disks:
        all_logical_disks[key].append(logical_disks)
</code></pre>

<p>This helped me to get a dict of type: {u'Local Fixed Disk': [[u'C:', u'D:'],[u'E:', u'F:']]} which grouped logical patitions in different physical disks. Now I can compare if the logical paths lie in the same list.</p>
