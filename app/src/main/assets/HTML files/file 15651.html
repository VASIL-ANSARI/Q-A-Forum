<p>Well, I only see three alternatives:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Robot Entity is created with the value</li>
<li>The value is passed into the Robot Entity at some point in time</li>
<li>The Robot Entity obtains the value, most likely from some sort of Factory or Singleton</li>
</ol>

<p>I would think that option 3 would be the best way to go.</p>
