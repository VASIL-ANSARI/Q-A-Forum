<p>The way your code is written, you are putting the literal string "end_date" into your javascript. If you want this to be ruby, you would need to wrap it in <code>&lt;%= %&gt;</code> brackets. That being said, the syntax for the bootstrap datepicker is to use a number followed by 'd'. Try:</p>

<pre><code>  $('#date').datepicker({
    endDate: "+100d";
  });
</code></pre>
