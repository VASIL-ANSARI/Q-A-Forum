<p>The behavior you are seeing is frustrating, but correct. When you serve a page with HTTPS, you must also serve all linked content under HTTPS as well. </p>

<p>Check our Protocol-relative URLs (<a href="http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/" rel="nofollow">http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/</a>) </p>

<p>Basically, they look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="//domain.com/img/logo.png"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your page is HTTP, the resource loads under HTTP, and if its HTTP, it loads securely, under HTTPS. </p>

<p>You must set up your server to serve out the CSS/JS/WS content under both, but once you do, the relative link above will allow you to switch seemlessly between the two. So for links in your master page, use the relative format, and then it won't matter if a content page is running under HTTP or HTTPS, the resources will pull from the same protocol as the page.</p>
