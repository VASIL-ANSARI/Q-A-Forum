<p>As an opinion! You know it depends on data that you add to cache storage. If it's some static data such as status, position etc. you can set the second param <code>duration</code>. You can read about at official <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-caching-data.html#query-caching-usages" rel="nofollow">doc</a>.<br>
If you make a few same queries on the page you can set 1 or 2 seconds and it helps you a little.</p>
