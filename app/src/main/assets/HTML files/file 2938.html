<p>Say the view you created is called <code>newView</code> and the controller is <code>newController</code>. The simple approach would be:</p>

<pre><code>newController.view = newView;
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd rather subclass <code>UIViewController</code> and override its <code>- (void)loadView</code> and <code>- (void)viewDidLoad</code> methods and create and/or manipulate the view there - that's the way Apple wants you to do it, and for good reason.</p>
