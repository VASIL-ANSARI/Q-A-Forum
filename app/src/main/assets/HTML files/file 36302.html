<p>Hello I would like to help you but your description is very vague and confusing could you please make a list describing the steps that this program is intended to do. I looked at your code and from I could gather from your description this may help.</p>

<pre><code>    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Enter Number of Records: ");
    int numOfRecords = scanner.nextInt();

    for(int x = 0; x &lt;= numOfRecords; x++) {
    String EmpNo[] = new String[numOfRecords];
    String EmpName[] = new String[numOfRecords];
    String Salary[] = new String[numOfRecords];
   }

   //Whatever else you want to do
</code></pre>
