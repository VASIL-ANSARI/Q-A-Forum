<p>Yes, in Java, <code>new int[X]</code> creates a zero-initialized array.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.5" rel="nofollow">JLS Â§4.12.5</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each class variable, instance variable, or array component is initialized with a default value when it is created (Â§15.9, Â§15.10) ... For type int, the default value is zero, that is, 0. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the reason you're getting zeros is because you increment <code>pathlen</code> <em>twice</em> every time you insert an element, so you insert an element and then skip the next element (leaving it at 0):</p>

<pre><code>paths[pathlen++] = tree.val;
pathlen++;
</code></pre>

<p>You only have to increment once.</p>
