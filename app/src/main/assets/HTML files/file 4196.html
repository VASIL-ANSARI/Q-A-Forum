<p>I Figured out my own issue.</p>

<p>There is a DLL NTidy.dll in the bin folder.  </p>

<p>This dll required the following dlls to be in the system32 folder:</p>

<ul>
<li>msvcp71d.dll ( Microsoft C++ Runtime Library )</li>
<li>msvcp71.dll ( Microsoft C++ Runtime Library )</li>
<li>msvcr71d.dll ( Microsoft C Runtime Library )</li>
<li>msvcr71.dll ( Microsoft C Runtime Library )</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I added those dlls the application began to work.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
