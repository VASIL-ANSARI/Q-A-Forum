<p><code>range(0, len(a) - 1)</code> should be more performant of the 2 options.  The other makes an unnecessary copy of the sequence (sans 1 element).  For looping like this, you might even get a performance boost by using <code>xrange</code> on python2.x as that avoids materializing a list from the <code>range</code> call.</p>

<p>Of course, you <em>usually</em> don't need to loop over indices in python -- There's usually a better way.</p>
