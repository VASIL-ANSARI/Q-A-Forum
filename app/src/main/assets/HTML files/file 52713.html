<p>If the null character is on it's own row you should be able to just skip it within a list comprehension. This searches for None but can easily be adjust to search for "" or "Null"</p>

<pre><code>csv_as_list = [row for row in csv_file if row is not "\0"]

for row in reader:
    try:
        # do stuff with row
    except:
       continue
</code></pre>
