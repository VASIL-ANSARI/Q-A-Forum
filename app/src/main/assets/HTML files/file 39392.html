<p>Consider reading documentation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ExecuteSqlCommandAsync</p>
</blockquote>

<p>does not return the selected value in the SP as return value. It returns an error code - of the SP. Which you never set. And which is an int.</p>

<p>You need to open a data reader or use a scalar version of execute (which returns row 1 column 1) to get the GUID.</p>

<p>The documentation is obviously clear on that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return Value Type: System.Threading.Tasks.Task&lt;Int32&gt; A task that
  represents the asynchronous operation. The task result contains the
  result returned by the database after executing the command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which indicates you never read it.</p>
