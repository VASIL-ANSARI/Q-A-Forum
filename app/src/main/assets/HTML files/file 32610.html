<p>Davmail server can be used to translate OWA calls to standard ones: <a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://davmail.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of proprietary Exchange. This means LDAP for global address book, SMTP to send messages, IMAP to browse messages on the server in any folder, POP to retrieve inbox messages only, Caldav for calendar support and Carddav for personal contacts sync. Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft Exchange.</p>
