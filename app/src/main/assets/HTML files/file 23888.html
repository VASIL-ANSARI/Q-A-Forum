<p>I am sure there is a better and more detailed answer for this, but from what I understand you are probably trying to display the date in a given format, not actually convert it in the database, correct?  </p>

<p>If you are using a binding handler such as Knockout.js you can just change the format in which it is displayed instead of converting the date/time stamp.  I am always cautious of converting the dates just to display them because I have had issue in the past with the database getting mad at me for such a thing.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a custom binding handler to show date time as May 29th, 2013, 2:22:00 pm</p>

<pre><code>ko.bindingHandlers.DateTime = {
    update: function (element, valueAccessor) {
        var value = valueAccessor();
        var date = moment(value());
        var strDate = date.format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a');
        $(element).text(strDate);
    }
};
</code></pre>
