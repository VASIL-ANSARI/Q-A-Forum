<p>Instead of using a DataGrid or GridView, I believe this is better suited to a Repeater, where you have better control of the formatting of the data.  Then you could load the data into a Dictionary of Models with a List of Manufacturers (<code>Dictionary&lt;Model, List&lt;Manufacturer&gt;&gt;</code>).  After loading the object up, you determine how to display it in the Repeater. </p>
