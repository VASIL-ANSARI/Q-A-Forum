<p>I am on my iPad right now so I can't really replicate the code but all I can say for now is that it seems like a timing issue. What happens is you click the button to scale the gallery, the resize function is called practically at the same time the animation to scale the gallery which takes 500 ms is launched. You need to either set a time out of greater that 500 ms on the resize function or call the function inside of the animate method. Basically you have to call the resize function after the gallery rescaling is complete.</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function() { resize(); }, 510);
</code></pre>
