<p>nice story btw). anyway to the problem.
you call function blue() that is not defined in your code - there is no such function ). if you meant to call blue1() you will get an error and that's because
you first need to <strong>declare the function before using it</strong>
for example:</p>

<pre><code> 1.this will not work:
blue()
def blue(): ...

2. this will work:
def blue(): ...
blue()
</code></pre>

<p>any way for good practice its good to maintain a simple code structure, all functions above and the main is the last one that calls other function. </p>
