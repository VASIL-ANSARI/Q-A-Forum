<p>Personally, I only use functions if, and only if, the following two requirements are met:</p>

<ol>
<li>I use it so frequently within a given class, or throughout the project, that it warrants being generalized.</li>
<li>It has no side-effects or context dependancies (none of that <code>void *context</code> mess).</li>
</ol>

<p>In my opinion, C-style functions should only be used as a last resort or in cases where you truly need functional behavior within this kind of an application.  Event handling is both application-specific, and context sensitive, so it's best if you left that alone and focused on refactoring common patterns out.</p>
