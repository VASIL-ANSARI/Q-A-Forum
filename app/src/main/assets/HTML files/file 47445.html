<p>It sounds like you are using a UISearchDisplayController or a UISearchController. In both cases, they tend to reuse the cellForRow method with a <em>new</em> table view that is maintained by the controller. One solution is to register for the cells on this new table view controller, another solution is to ask the original table view to dequeue the cell for the new table view.</p>
