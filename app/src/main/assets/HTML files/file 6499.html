<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/data-access/tutorials/displaying-summary-information-in-the-gridview-s-footer-cs" rel="nofollow">This article</a> discusses a couple of approaches to this problem and gives you some sample code.  The one I've used in the past is to have a couple of private fields in the Page code-behind: one for the count and one for the sum. You can then increment these in the GridView's <code>RowDataBound</code> event when the row in question is a data row. When it is a footer row, you compute the average and display it in the right cell.</p>
