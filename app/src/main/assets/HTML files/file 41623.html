<p>I could not achieve the thing you need without multi threading and this is not possible because gui can be only updated in main thread. Below is an algorithm how I did this with multithreading.</p>

<p>Let's say you have your application processing images. Then there are the following threads:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main thread (that blocks by GUI/QApplication-derived classes.exec())</li>
<li>Timer with, for example, 1 second interval which updates a variable and calls a slot in GUI thread which updates a variable in user interface.</li>
<li><p>A thread which is processing images on your pc.</p>

<pre><code>def process(self):
    self._status = "processing image 1"
    ....

def _update(self):
    self.status_label.setText(self._status)

def start_processing(self, image_path):
    # create thread for process and run it
    # create thread for updating by using QtCore.QTimer()
    # connect qtimer triggered signal to and `self._update()` slot
    # connect image processing thread (use connect signal to any slot, in this example I'll stop timer after processing thread finishes)
    @pyqtSlot()
    def _stop_timer():
        self._qtimer.stop()
        self._qtimer = None
    _update_thread.finished.connect(_stop_timer)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>In pyqt5 it is possible to assign a pyqtvariable from a one nested thread(first level). So you can make your variable a pyqtvariable with setter and getter and update gui in a setter or think how you can do this by yourself.</p>
