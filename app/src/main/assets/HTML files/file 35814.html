<p>"I want my plugin to merge my project with the default files during compilation."<br />
Well, this is the way to go:<br />
It doesn't matter where your file resides.<br />
Just copy them to the expected folder , leaving existing files untouched.<br />
Make your default artifact use a different folder for storing the default files,<br />
so that while unpacking there are somehwere located in your current project.<br />
Specify this artifact as dependecy.<br />
Copy them from there .. fine?<br />
If this doesn't fit:<br />
Provide your own implementation for unpacking artifacts.<br />
I did so when building a maven plugin for C / C++ - artifacts, based on the work of Mark <br />Donszelmann's nar-naven-plugin.<br />
It isn't too hard.<br /></p>

<pre><code>List dependencies = this.getMavenProject().getDependencies();
    Iterator&lt;Dependency&gt; it = dependencies.iterator();
    String baseDir = this.getLocalRepository().getBasedir();
</code></pre>

<p>with 
   getMavenProject() returning MavenProject and getLocalRepository ArtifactRepository.</p>

<p>From there you can construct the path to your zip (jar), then unpack it with java.util.zip -<br /> classes and copy the default files.<br /></p>
