<p>Yes, technically, this could create a race condition of sorts.  The calls are asynchronous, and if the first got held up for some reason, the second could return first.</p>

<p>However, as you don't have a great deal that goes on in your callback functions that depend on the presence of the other 'side' being populated I don't see where it should cause you too much grief.</p>
