<p>So there are a few things up with your code, but let me help you with your immediate problem first and then I'll move on to the other issues.</p>

<p>You're using <code>github3.repository</code> in the line you're confused about. Let's look at the <a href="https://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.5/api.html#github3.repository" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for that specific function (which you can also see by calling <code>help(repository)</code>). You'll see that <code>repository</code> expects two arguments <code>owner</code> and <code>repository</code> and describes them as the owner of the repository and the name of the repository itself. So in your usage you would do</p>

<pre><code>repo = repository('Django', 'Django')
</code></pre>

<p>But where does that leave your authentication credentials... Well here's the other thing, you're doing</p>

<pre><code>fv4 = login(username, password, token)
</code></pre>

<p>You only need to specify some of those arguments. If you want to use a token then do</p>

<pre><code>fv4 = login(token=token)
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you want to use basic authentication</p>

<pre><code>fv4 = login(username, password)
</code></pre>

<p>Both will work just fine. If you want to continue to be authenticated you can then do</p>

<pre><code>repo = fv4.repository('Django', 'Django')
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>fv4</code> is a <code>GitHub</code> object which is documented <a href="https://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.5/github.html#github-object" rel="nofollow">here</a> and which the <code>repository</code> function uses underneath everything.</p>

<p>So that should help you get through most of your problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that in the documented examples for github3.py we usually call the result of <code>login()</code> <code>gh</code>. This is because <code>gh</code> is just a <code>GitHub</code> object with credentials stored. It isn't your user or anything like that. That would be (on your version of github3.py) <code>fv4 = gh.user()</code>. (If someone else is reading this and using a version of github3.py 1.0 (currently in pre-release) then it would be <code>fv4 = gh.me()</code>.)</p>
