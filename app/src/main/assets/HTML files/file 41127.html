<p>Actually, "installing" mocha is not that much more complicated than "installing" jQuery! Simply include the file. This makes it actually really easy to set up a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kbjwLsab/12/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a> for testing Javascript code. I've done that with 3 simple tests so that you can see the syntax, and easily get started testing your javascript code with mocha. As always, refer to the <a href="http://mochajs.org/" rel="nofollow">mocha docs</a>, the <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/" rel="nofollow">chai docs</a> when you want to learn more.</p>

<pre><code>mocha.setup("bdd");
chai.should();
var asdf = "tests.";
//simple test
describe('Simple ' + asdf, function(){
    it('true = true?', function(){
        var j = true;
        var i = true;
        i.should.equal(j);
    });
});
// Run all our test suites.  Only necessary in the browser.
mocha.run();
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a JSFiddle with mocha loaded so you can get started:</p>
