<p>It's a while since I did this, but I think the generated "dictionary" is required to <strong>encode</strong> data, while the "tree" is used to <strong>decode</strong> it. Of course, you can always build one from the other.</p>

<p>While decoding, you traverse the tree (left/right, according to successive input bits), and when you hit a terminal node (null pointer) then the 'sym' in the node is the output value.</p>
