<p>This is a common confusion in multithreading. You are confusing the thread object <code>class Thread : public QThread</code> with the thread of execution (ie executing instructions). </p>

<ul>
<li>There is one thread of execution which is running the code <code>ThreadDialog::startOrStopThreadA</code></li>
<li>There is another thread of execution which is running <code>Thread::run()</code> and which is started by <code>threadA.start()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these threads have access to <code>messageStr</code> and <code>stopped</code></p>
