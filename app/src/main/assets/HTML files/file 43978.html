<p>This is pretty simple with an additional join.  It's easiest to wrap this up in a subquery or CTE, though:</p>

<pre><code>WITH PrdDir AS (SELECT Df.id, Df.role, COALESCE(Ot.code, Df.code) AS code
                FROM Table_1 Df
                LEFT JOIN Table_1 Ot
                       ON Ot. id = Df.id
                          AND Df.role = 'PRODUCER'
                          AND Ot.role = 'DIRECTOR')

SELECT PrdDir.id, PrdDir.role, Table_2.ref_value, Table_3.code, Table_3.name 
FROM PrdDir
JOIN Table_2
  ON Table_2.col_name = PrdDir.role
JOIN Table_3
  ON Table_3.code = PrdDir.code
</code></pre>

<p>Please don't use the implicit-join syntax (the comma-separated <code>FROM</code> clause) - for one thing, you can't do <code>LEFT JOIN</code>s with it in DB2 - in this query, if there is no director, at least the producer will still be returned.  For another it's all too easy to forget a condition, and get a Cartesian product by accident.</p>
