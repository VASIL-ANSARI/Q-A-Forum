<p>It appears you just send a series of bytes with no delimiter or indicator of the data size. If you want to send multiple chunks of data like you are, you need a way to tell where one chunk ends and the next starts.</p>

<p>One common approach would be to send a length, then the data. The length would be the number of bytes and this would always be 4 or 8 bytes. This would all be handled in the <code>sendData:error:</code> method.</p>

<p>On the receiving end you would read the 4 or 8 bytes representing the length, then you would read <code>length</code> bytes.</p>

<p>In the end, you would send the following data:</p>

<ol>
<li>song data length</li>
<li>song data</li>
<li>artist data length</li>
<li>artist data</li>
<li>image data length</li>
<li>image data</li>
</ol>
