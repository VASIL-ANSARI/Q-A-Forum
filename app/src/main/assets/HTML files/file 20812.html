<p>if you have installed older version of your app, when the table is not been presented, just installing the new version won't replace the old database. Uninstall the app from the device and install the newer one should work. Or make implementation of the <code>onUpgrade</code> trigger.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>you might also try to replace this line:</p>

<pre><code>myDataBase = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(myPath, null, SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READWRITE);
</code></pre>

<p>with this:</p>

<pre><code>myDataBase = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(myPath, null, SQLiteDatabase.NO_LOCALIZED_COLLATORS);
</code></pre>
