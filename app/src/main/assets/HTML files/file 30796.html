<p>Because of the statement with the operative word <strong>prior</strong>: '</p>

<p><code>prior to the println statement</code></p>

<p>8 <code>String</code> objects were created before (prior to) the <code>println</code> as you described.  Another 2 were created on the <code>println</code>, <code>" "</code> and <code>spring winter spring summer</code></p>

<pre><code>String s1 = "spring ";             // "spring" created, reference s1 changed
String s2 = s1 + "summer ";        // "summer", "spring summer" created, "summer" not saved, reference s2 changed
s1.concat("fall ");                // "fall", "spring fall" created but not saved
s2.concat(s1);                     // "spring summer spring" created but not saved
s1 += "winter ";                   // "winter", "spring winter" created, reference s1 changed
System.out.println(s1 + " " + s2); //" ", "spring winter spring summer" created, " "  not saved
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: "created" doesn't mean created at this point in the code, just that this piece of code will ask that it be created.</p>
