<p>Simply have a boolean set to true when the left mouse button is held and set it to false when its released.</p>

<p>If you check the condition of the bool when you fire the OnMouseMove event then you will be able to find out if its held down or not.</p>

<p><strong>Psuedo code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>private bool isDown;

MouseDown()
{
   isDown = true;
}

MouseUp()
{
   isDown = false;
}
OnMouseMove()
{
   if(isDown)
   {
       //Do something...
   }
}
</code></pre>
