<p>The difference here is that your <code>MyStruct</code> (struct or class) exposes a public field while anonymous classes (<code>new { }</code>) expose public properties.</p>

<p>When you access a value type from a field or variable, you do not get a copy, you access the instance directly. Therefore making changes to it stores them in the instance.</p>

<p>When you instead access it via a property or method, you get a returned copy of your <code>StringWrapper</code> and changing that doesn't change what is stored in the anonymous classes private field.</p>

<p>Just to demonstrate, you can get the same behavior by making your <code>Item</code> field a property too:</p>

<pre><code>public StringWrapper Item { get; set; }
</code></pre>
