<p>Looking at the Mono source code the crash seems to be related to the way the Mono runtime is initialized (relying on zeroed variables).</p>

<p>So you have to call <code>mono_jit_init()</code> once in the life of the runtime.</p>

<p>That means your application's life if the library is statically loaded but only a load/unload cycle if the Mono runtime is loaded dynamically via <code>dl_open()</code>. Besides the extra work of caching Mono function pointers, this workaround may not be practical to run concurrent Mono tasks.</p>

<p>Another way to proceed (and which supports concurrent runs) is to cache the runtime context for further uses instead of creating it repeatedly with <code>mono_jit_init()</code>. You will have to use a dedicated Mono <code>domain</code> to do fancy things like unloading <code>assemblies</code>.</p>

<p>There's always a solution. It just takes time to find one that works best for your needs.</p>
