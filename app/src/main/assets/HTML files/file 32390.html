<p>Technically <code>protected</code> in Java includes both subclasses of the class in question, <em>and</em> other classes (not necessarily subclasses) that are in the same package.  So it would be possible for another class in <code>java.io</code> to directly instantiate a <code>FilterInputStream</code>.  The only reason I can think for why you'd want to do that is that <code>FilterInputStream.read(byte[] b)</code> delegates to <code>this.read(b, 0, b.length)</code> rather than <code>delegate.read(b)</code> so it's a way to prevent the delegate's <code>read(byte[])</code> method from ever getting called.  But that's all speculation on my part.</p>

<p>Other than that specific case, as you note it is <em>effectively</em> abstract, but it doesn't have any abstract methods so the compiler would not require that the class be declared abstract.</p>
