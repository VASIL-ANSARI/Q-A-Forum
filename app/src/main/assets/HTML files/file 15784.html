<p>As far as I know there is no datatype for it in MySQL. I would suggest not to create separate table as you suggest. If precision is not of utmost importance you can just store them as a decimal with a specific width and query with the decimal value. You can always <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5124743/algorithm-for-simplifying-decimal-to-fractions">convert it back to its fractional representation in the application layer</a>. If simplicity matters you can store them as varchar. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10507598/661933">here</a> for a related question.</p>
