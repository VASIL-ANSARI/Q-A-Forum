<p>If I'm right you just add delete.js.erb (with the js code you want to execute) in your users view folder :</p>

<pre><code>    views/user/delete.js.erb
</code></pre>

<p>And in your users_controller.rb</p>

<pre><code>    def delete

      #your controller code here

      respond_to do |format|
        format.js #this will call delete.js.erb when js action is called
      end
    end
</code></pre>
