<p>You can always make use of the nice formatting that the standard containers come with. For example, your Bar description could be:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)containerDescription {
  return [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:s1, @"s1", s2, @"s2", nil];
}

- (NSString *)description {
  return [self.containerDescription description];
</code></pre>

<p>You can now do the following on Foo:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)description {
  NSArray *desc = [barsArray valueForKey:@"containerDescription"];
  NSDictionary *descriptionDictionary =
    [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:desc, @"foo contents", nil];
  return [descriptionDictionary description];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is not optimal of course, as you have to have a second method and have to call the containerDescription on higher levels, but it's the only one I found yet.</p>
