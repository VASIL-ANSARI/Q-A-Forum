<p>Your footer is fixed to the bottom of the window due to</p>

<pre><code>.gbtr_dark_footer_wrapper .container_12 .grid_3 {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0 !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As your resolution increases, the content will fill up only the top of the page, and the footer will stay at the bottom, leaving a huge whitespace in between.</p>
