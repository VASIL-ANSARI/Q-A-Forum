<p>Click event is not possible in <code>UIPickerView</code>.</p>

<p>You can use <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code> to get <code>CGPoint</code> and then calculate index of row clicked. But I will highly recommend not to do such things (Apple may reject the App) as <code>PickerView</code> is all about scrolling the list.</p>
