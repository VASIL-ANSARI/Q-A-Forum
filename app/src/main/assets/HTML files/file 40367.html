<p>your spot is being drawn behind all the other panels. if you add </p>

<pre><code>setComponentZOrder(spot, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>this will cause it to be drawn on top of everything else.</p>

<p>A better way to approach this would be to draw the x inside of the panels that you have instead of on top of them.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>you can add your x to a specific panel with </p>

<pre><code>panel[0].add(spot);
</code></pre>
