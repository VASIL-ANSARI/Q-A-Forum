<p>JSplitPane has its own layout manager-- you shouldn't change it to GridBagLayout.  If you want to use GridBagLayout in the panes, create a JPanel to put in the JSplitPane, and set the layout of that panel to GridBagLayout.  Then you put the panel in the JSplitPane, and the controls in the panel.</p>
