<p>Well, it's not the developer console, but you can use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> for that. There is an API to use it with Android, explained here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/</a></p>

<p>It's up to you, what exactly you're gonna track, but it's very easy and for dealing with the statistics you have all the power of Google Analytics at hand.</p>

<p>EDIT: For best results with least effort, you should use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/devguide#eztracker" rel="nofollow">EasyTracker</a> library, which makes sure that communication with the server is done in a separate thread; otherwise you will experience 'hickups' in the UI.</p>
