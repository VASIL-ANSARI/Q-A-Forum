<p>There is one major problem: you're trying to determine the length of the input before receiving any input.</p>

<p>so switch the lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>printf ("input\n");
fgets (input, sizeof (input), stdin);
n = strlen(input);
</code></pre>

<p>Then your for-loop ... why so heavy testing, wouldn't</p>

<pre><code>for ( front = 0, back = n-1; front &lt; back; ++front, --back)
</code></pre>

<p>be sufficient?</p>

<p>And at last: the rest of your code.  Please think about it again.  You want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>print all characters from the beginning up to and including <code>front</code></li>
<li>print all characters from back till the end</li>
<li>print a newline</li>
</ul>

<p>Your code does nothing about this.  But we're not here to solve your homework ;)</p>

<p>A last hint: there are two different types of stop-condition, and they depend on if your input length is even or odd.  (My suggested test should be ok to catch'em both, tho).</p>
