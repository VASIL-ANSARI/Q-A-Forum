<p>Use a version control system. Git would be a good choice, since you can set up a bare repository on the USB stick and sync with it from each machine.</p>

<p>Git has a hefty learning curve, but the huge benefits to your workflow will be worth the effort many times over.</p>

<p>Another choice is Mercurial. I strongly dislike Mercurial's branching model(s) (which I consider to be broken) and the lack of a staging area, but many projects have had good success with it, so it's worth considering. Mercurial also has the advantages of being easier to learn and better supported on Windows than git.</p>
