<p>If your not running behind a proxy, it's not required.  Eg, if your running multiple websites on a server, chances are your using a Proxy. </p>

<p>X-Forwarded-For header attributes get added when doing this so that your proxy can see what the original url was, proxying in the end will be going to localhost you see. The reason why it's needed is that X-Forwared-For can be faked, there is nothing stopping the client adding these too, not just a proxy. So trust-proxy should only be enabled on the receiving end, that would be behind your firewall. Because you have control, you can trust this.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, if your website is running behind a proxy, you can enable it.  If you website is running direct on port 80, you don't want to trust it.  As the sender could pretend to be coming from localhost etc.</p>
