<p>According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7583770/unable-to-update-the-entityset-because-it-has-a-definingquery-and-no-updatefu">this SO article</a>, this error can occur if the entity set is mapped from the database view, custom database query or if database table does not have primary key.</p>

<p>This has happened to me before, and I used that same article to fix the issue :)</p>
