<p>You've got to put everything in a class, make a main method, and call your method from the main method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Greeting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greeting();
    }

    public static void greeting(){
        String greet = "This program will play 3 games of rock paper scissors with you.\n\n"+
                      "It will ask you for your choice and then randomly generate a choice for the computer.\n\n"+
                      "After all 3 games you will be shown the total results.";
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, greet, "Greeting",1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
