<p>Couldn't understand what the problem was but I tried this in unbuntu and it worked perfectly, so it was a windows problem. Probably it was related with ImageMagick functions (as almost all problems related to image gems and windows..).</p>

<p>I will mark this answer as solved although no explanation about the problem as been made. </p>
