<p>I'm the maintainer of the ServiceStack.Redis client - can I ask which build are you having problems with? i.e. what build references were you missing?</p>

<p>I've currently in the process of moving to GitHub (which is now the official project site of the open source project). </p>

<p>So from now on the latest source code and binary releases will be available here:
<a href="https://github.com/mythz/ServiceStack.Redis" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mythz/ServiceStack.Redis</a></p>

<p>In GitHub the Redis Client is now a self-contained, top-level project so you should be able to build without any problems.</p>

<p>Older binary releases (and source code) should still be available from the old project site:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/ServiceStackRedis" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/ServiceStackRedis</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>-Demis</p>
