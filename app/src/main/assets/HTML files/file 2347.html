<p>You are fetching a JavaScript snippet that is supposed to be built in directly into the document, not queried by a script. The code inside is JavaScript.</p>

<p>You could pull out the code using a regular expression, but I would advise against it. First, it's probably not legal to do. Second, the format of the data they serve can change any time, breaking your script.</p>

<p>I think you should take at <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PunOfTheDay"><strong>their RSS feed</strong></a>. You can parse that programmatically way easier than the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Check out this question on how to do that: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/250679/best-way-to-parse-rss-atom-feeds-with-php"><strong>Best way to parse RSS/Atom feeds with PHP</strong></a></p>
