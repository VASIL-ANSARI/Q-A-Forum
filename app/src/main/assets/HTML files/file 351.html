<p>I would dump them all into your favorite Set implementation.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Now that I understand the question, your original solution looks like the best way to do this.  Just loop through the array once, keeping an array of flags to mark which elements to keep, plus a counter to keep track to the size of the new array.  Then loop through again to copy all the keepers to a new array.</p>
