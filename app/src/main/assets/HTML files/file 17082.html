<p>I have successfully resolved my problem.<br>
I stopped my current mysql service and installed xampp.
Don't forget to uncheck where it ask you to install services on insallation wizard.<br>
And then I started mysql service which was installed already.<br>
and edit <strong>config.inc.php</strong> as below..  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'config'  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>to   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie'  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and you will be prompted to give your current password and username at phpmyadmin login..  </p>

<p><strong>Thank you for all guys who tried to help me..</strong></p>
