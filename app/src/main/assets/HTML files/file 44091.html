<p>For python 2 you need to add a <code>u</code>, your string is not actually unicode:</p>

<pre><code>text = u"Ãno"
</code></pre>

<p>You can also write your expression as <code>count = sum(c.isupper() for c in text)</code>, <code>c.isupper()</code> will return True or False so 1 or 0.</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: text = "Ãno"

In [2]: count = sum(c.isupper() for c in text)

In [3]: count
Out[3]: 0    
In [4]: text = u"Ãno"
In [5]: count = sum(c.isupper() for c in text)    
In [6]: count
Out[6]: 1
In [7]: text = "Ãno".decode("utf-8")   
In [8]: count = sum(c.isupper() for c in text)    
In [9]: count
Out[9]: 1
</code></pre>
