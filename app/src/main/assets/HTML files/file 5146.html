<p>I'd highly recommend using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapserver.php" rel="nofollow">SoapServer</a> for this kind of project.</p>

<p>There is merit to the comment that such an endeavor is NOT to be undertaken lightly, as you're talking about highly sensitive information here - financial stuff and credit card information. However, my answer should stand as a way to approach the technical implementation of such a system. It will then be relatively simple to ship out a wsdl file and let software consume the service via SOAP in the language/platform of their choice.</p>
