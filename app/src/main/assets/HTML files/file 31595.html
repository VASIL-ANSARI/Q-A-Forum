<p>Bad string concatenation.</p>

<pre><code>$update_sql = "UPDATE movies SET `nowvideo` = IF(LENGTH('" . $_POST['nowvideo'] . "')=0, nowvideo, '" . $_POST['nowvideo'] . "'), `nowvideohd` =  '".$_POST['nowvideohd']."' WHERE name='".$_POST['movie_name']."';";
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, your query is very insecure. You're putting data directly from the form into a query. Read up on SQL injection &amp; sanitizing your queries.</p>

<p>I'd also read up on PDO if you're planning on securing your queries anyway.</p>
