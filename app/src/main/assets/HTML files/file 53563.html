<p>If you are parsing CSV I would recommend that you use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper" rel="nofollow">CsvHelper</a>. We have been using it for a very similar task. It has all sorts of awesome configuration. </p>

<pre><code>var csvConfiguration = new CsvConfiguration
{
    Quote = '"',
    Delimiter = ",",
    TrimFields = true,
    TrimHeaders = true,
    QuoteNoFields = false,
    QuoteAllFields = false,
    HasHeaderRecord = true,
    IsHeaderCaseSensitive = false,
    WillThrowOnMissingField = false
};

var field = csvReader.GetField("YourFieldName"),
</code></pre>

<p>It also has a very nice <a href="https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper/wiki/Fluent-Class-Mapping" rel="nofollow">mapping functionality</a> </p>
