<p>I would recommend using the <code>android:layout_gravity="bottom|right"</code> tag on the date <code>TextView</code>. This will attempt to lay out the <code>View</code> as if the container was "pushing" it to the bottom and right corner.</p>

<p>This may or may not work for all <code>View</code>s. But as @codeMagic said, if you saw their code, then it should be apparent, right?</p>
