<p>I know nothing about "smint", but using jQuery, you could set the scroll position of the page to the top when the page loads, like this:</p>

<h1><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tb9U6/" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle</a></h1>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(window).scrollTop(0);
});
</code></pre>

<p>What this should do is, wait for the page to load, and then set the scroll position to the top of the window.</p>

<p>If this doesn't happen to work because the browser sets the scroll position after your jQuery executes or something, you could try setting the scroll position to the top before refreshing the page, that way when it refreshes and goes to the previous scroll position, that will be the top of the page anyways.</p>
