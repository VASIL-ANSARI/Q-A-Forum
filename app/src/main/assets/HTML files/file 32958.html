<p>I tried it in my pc and it works well. The project is not the problem.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to copy the project in your workspace and try to import it in Eclipse from there. I don't know if it is a bug or not but it won't work.</p>

<p>Try to unzip the project in a folder on your Desktop and try to import it from there. When you select it, check the box "Copy project into workspace" if you want to have it in your workspace folder.</p>
