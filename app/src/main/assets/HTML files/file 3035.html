<p>Edit: Ok, I guess I finally have something from the standard:</p>

<p>Note that <code>v</code> is of type <code>int</code> which has an built-in assignment operator:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>13.3.1.2 Operators in expressions</strong></p>
  
  <p>4 For the built-in assignment operators, conversions of the left operand are restricted as follows:
  â no temporaries are introduced to hold the left operand, and [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>fun1()</code> should return a reference. A non-reference/pointer return type of a function is a r-value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>3.10 Lvalues and rvalues</strong></p>
  
  <p>5 The result of calling a function that does not return an lvalue reference is an rvalue [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thusly, <code>fun1().v</code> is a rvalue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8.3.2 References</strong></p>
  
  <p>2 A reference type that is declared
  using &amp; is called an lvalue reference,
  and a reference type that is declared
  using &amp;&amp; is called an rvalue
  reference. Lvalue references and
  rvalue references are distinct types.</p>
