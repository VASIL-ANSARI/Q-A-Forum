<p>I had similar issue. I Hosted WCF as WAS service and it worked fine. It has to do somewith with configuraton and I am not sure what it is?</p>

<p>Also, other interesting thing I noted is that if I keep the code in the code behind generated by WCF itself, it works. ( Mtom / stream configuration). But if I seperate the code behind(interface and implementation) to different directory, it fails. I ended up using the same code with WAS instead of IIS and everything works fine.</p>
