<p>It is no wonder you cannot expand the code to more than two colums if you are regarding your columns as key/value pairs in a dictionary.</p>

<p>You have to see them as "elements in a set".  I understand this is why you are not using the <code>csv</code> module or the <code>difflib</code> module: because you do not care whether the lines appear in (nearly) same order in either file, but whether they appear at all.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools


def compare(first_filename, second_filename):
    lines1 = set()
    lines2 = set()
    with open(first_filename, 'r') as file1, \
            open(second_filename, 'r') as file2:
        for line1, line2 in itertools.izip_longest(file1, file2):
            if line1:
                lines1.add(line1)
            if line2:
                lines2.add(line2)
    print "Different lines"
    for line in lines1 ^ lines2:
        print line,
    print "---"
    print "Common lines"
    for line in lines1 &amp; lines2:
        print line,
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this code will find differences on both files, not just things that exist on f1 but not on f2, as your example does. However, it is not able to tell where do differences come from (since this does not seem a requirement of the question).</p>
