<p>There seems to be a bug in GSP error reporting in Grails 2.0.3 . This commit might have fixed it: <a href="https://github.com/grails/grails-core/commit/fbb46af1aac77dd215eae7a1625f830fc2b1cb29" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/grails/grails-core/commit/fbb46af1aac77dd215eae7a1625f830fc2b1cb29</a></p>

<p>Please re-test the GSP error reporting with Grails 2.1.0 RC1 version and if the problem remains, report the problem in Grails Jira with a test case. That would help improving the GSP error reporting. Thanks!</p>
