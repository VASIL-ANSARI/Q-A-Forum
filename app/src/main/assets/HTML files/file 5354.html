<p>When you use the shorthand Font property and you leave off some of the values, those values aren't inherited, they are reset to their "initial value".</p>

<p>It's probably also complicated a little more by the fact that you are lining up a Select element which may have some additional issues depending on which browser and platform your browsing on because some browsers use native system widgets for form elements.</p>
