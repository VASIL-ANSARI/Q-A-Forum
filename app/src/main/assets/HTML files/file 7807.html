<p>One quick solution would be to check with <code>substr()</code> if the input has any math operators (+, -, ...) in it. If so, do the math either using <code>eval()</code> (quite a dirty hack, since it accepts all PHP code and not only math) or build the appropriate tree of operations manually and then produce the results. If there are no math operators, just print out the input.</p>
