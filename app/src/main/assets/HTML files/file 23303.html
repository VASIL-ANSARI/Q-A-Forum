<p>It's not c++, it's php that is why you need to throw either <strong>Exception</strong> object or instance of object that is <strong>subclass of Exception</strong></p>

<p>From PHP manual</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thrown object must be an instance of the <a href="http://pl1.php.net/manual/en/class.exception.php" rel="nofollow">Exception</a> class or a subclass of Exception. Trying to throw an object that is not will result in a PHP Fatal Error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that is why you always have access to Exception class methods for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>final public string getMessage ( void ) //Gets the Exception message</li>
<li>final public string getTraceAsString ( void ) //Gets the stack trace as a string</li>
</ul>

<p>that is why you can use <code>catch(Exception $e){ echo $e-&gt;getMessage();}</code> to get message of exception or trace which are always string.</p>

<p>If you want to pass Exception object you can extend Exception class and override <strong><a href="http://pl1.php.net/manual/en/exception.tostring.php" rel="nofollow">__toString()</a></strong>  method to fit your needs. </p>
