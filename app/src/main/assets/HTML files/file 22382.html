<p>Don't do it from a model. If you need to generate a newsletter, the newsletter is an email, so use a mailer. If your content is user-specific, then pass the needed data to the mailer notification method. The mailer inherites from ActionDispatch::Base, that means you have access to the rendering engine, HAML, Slim, ERB, whatever you are using. After you're done testing and developing building user-specific emails, you should create a rake task that r builds and sends a newsletter to each user. After having this task, you can map it to a cron job which will execute it automatically in production whenever you decide. </p>

<p>Just don't let the whole MVC mountain in Rails fool you, the newsletter is a completely different beast, it doesn't belong in the application logic. </p>
