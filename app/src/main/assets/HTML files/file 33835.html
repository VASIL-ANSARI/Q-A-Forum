<p>If you test an external webservice, you don't need spring. You even don't need java as you might as well write good tests with <code>soapUI</code>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you're testing your own webservice classes, you probably have to mock some services at testing time, and therefore spring testing might help alot.</p>
