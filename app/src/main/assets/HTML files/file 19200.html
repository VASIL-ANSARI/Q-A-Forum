<p>I am having this same problem. Anyone have ideas?</p>

<p>Hey Miles: I found the solution after some massive hunting...

<p>WarehouseMultimedia's post is what helped. The php.ini change is what did the trick. I never edited the .htaccess file and it was working. I was also on version 1.7 and it the solution still worked.</p>

<p>I fixed this by increasing memory_limit &amp; max_execution_time settings in both php.ini &amp; .htaccess:</p>

<p>php.ini </p>

<pre><code>memory_limit = 256M

max_execution_time = 18000
</code></pre>

<p>.htaccess </p>

<pre><code>php_value memory_limit 256M

php_value max_execution_time 18000
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to be an issue that is unique to bluehost. Are you using bluehost?</p>
