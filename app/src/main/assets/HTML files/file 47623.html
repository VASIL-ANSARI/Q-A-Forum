<p>The line</p>

<pre><code>private Node[] next = new Node[R];
</code></pre>

<p>declares and initializes the field <code>next</code> which is an <em>array reference</em> (you should read <code>Node[]</code> as "<code>Node</code> array"). The expression <code>new Node[R]</code> does not create any node, it creates an array of nodes. So there is no recursion.</p>

<p>If you had a field such as</p>

<pre><code>private Node someNode = new Node();
</code></pre>

<p>then indeed you would have a recursion because each node would create another node that creates a next one, and so on.</p>
