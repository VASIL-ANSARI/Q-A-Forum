<p>Why not do a straight aggregation of the values mapped to the corresponding point value?  (Unless it is straight 100 * the roll value, in which case it is even easier.)</p>

<pre><code>int score = 0;
for( i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i )
{
    switch( roll1[i] )
    {
    case 1: score += 100; break;
    case 2: score += 230; break;
    case 3: score += 540; break;
    case 4: score += 2320; break;
    case 5: score += 13130; break;
    case 6: score += 454260; break;  /* Of course, change to the score you want for each value. */
    }
}
printf("\n\n %s's Dice Roll:%d\n\n", player1, score);
</code></pre>

<p>"What I originally had in mind was to make the game like Farkle, where 1 is 100pts, 5 is 50pts, and everything else is 0 until you get 3 of a kind ( Three 3s = 300pts, Three 1s is 1000, etc). Any input would be greatly appreciated"  There are many ways.  You can do this easily and use Chux map approach for base and three of a kinds.</p>
