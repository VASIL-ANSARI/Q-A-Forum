<p>You shouldn't use IIS to do these sorts of tasks.  IIS is designed to respond to incoming requests.  Threads are managed by IIS itself, and the AppPool (i.e. AppDomain) could be recycled (or be suspended in Windows Server 2012 and later) at any time.  You could of course stop AppPool recycling etc., but it's still trying to make IIS feature do something it's not designed for.</p>

<p>You should write all of this background processing code to run as a Windows Service where you can control the process' lifetime.</p>
