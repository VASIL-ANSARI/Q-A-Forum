<p>Because you have some rows with the same value for LastModifiedOn it depends how you want to handle ties.</p>

<p>If you want this query to always return the 10 most "recent" rows but always return the same ones when there are ties you can add another column to your <code>ORDER BY viwPerformance.LastModifiedOn DESC</code> clause that will make the sort unique and unchanging, like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY viwPerformance.LastModifiedOn,viwPerformance.SmartGoalId DESC)
</code></pre>
