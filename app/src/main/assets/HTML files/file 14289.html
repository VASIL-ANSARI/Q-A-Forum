<p>First of all, in <code>createNewThread()</code> you declare a <code>boost::thread t</code> in a <em>local</em> scope and assign its pointer to the class member <code>mPtrThread</code>. After <code>createNewThread()</code> finishes, <code>t</code> is destroyed and mPtrThread would hold an illegal pointer.</p>

<p>I'd rather use something like <code>mPtrThread = new boost::thread(...)</code>;</p>
