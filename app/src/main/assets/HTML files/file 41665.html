<p>Have you looked into Table Per Hierarchy mappings using Entity Framework? Using the Type property on Car as the discriminator, you'd be able to add SportsCar and F1 entities to the data model and Entity Framework would retrieve them direct from the database. You could then use AutoMapper if you really want to have separate SportsCar and F1 classes in your domain model.</p>
