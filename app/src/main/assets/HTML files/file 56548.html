<p>Twig is not limiting you. You are limiting yourself by using Twig in the worst possible way :) The main purpose of Twig is rendering your templates, not processing your raw queries. You're just ruining your performance, because the code which you write in Twig is read by a Twig interpreter first - that's unnecessary overhead.</p>

<p>You should put your database logic in services (use Doctrine for that - no need to write raw SQL for such simple queries). Use those services in controllers. And finally, pass the data from controller to template and render it using Twig.</p>

<p>If you want to have some dynamic actions after the page is loaded - write some simple JavaScript and make use of AJAX (background) requests to your controllers to send or get some additional data from your server. Or use Web Sockets if you prefer your data to be pushed to your page in real time.</p>
