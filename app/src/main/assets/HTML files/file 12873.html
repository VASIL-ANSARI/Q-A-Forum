<p>You cannot force the OS to use Carrier network for internet through your code. </p>

<p>If WIFI is available through which the phone is connected and that wifi network does not have internet - there is no way you can force your app to use Carrier network for internet connection - so its pointless to know if the wifi network does have internet connectivity.</p>

<p>as for the other case, if user switch off wifi manually, OS will automatically switch to Carrier network for internet.</p>
