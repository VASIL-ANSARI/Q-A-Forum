<p>There's no endianness of the structure really. It's all the separate fields that need to be converted to big-endian when needed. You can either make a copy of the structure and rewrite each field using <code>hton</code>/<code>htons</code>, then send the result. 8-bit fields don't need any modification of course.</p>

<p>In case of TCP you could also just send each part separately and count on nagle algorithm to merge all parts into a single packet, but with UDP you need to prepare everything up front.</p>
