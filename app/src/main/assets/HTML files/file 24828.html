<p>Performance will have negligible effect in this case. </p>

<p>However you will have to declare your variables in case you are performing some actions on your variables.</p>

<pre><code>DataSet ds = new DataSet();

//ds = .....

String str = "FooBar";

//str.Replace(......
</code></pre>

<p>and then pass them</p>

<pre><code>abc(ds, str);
</code></pre>

<p>In programming its better to create a varible and pass the valuesb because readibility takes precedence over performance.</p>
