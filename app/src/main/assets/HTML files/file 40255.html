<p>Since it's JavaScript things that are no longer being used are removed via Garbage Collector(GC), freeing memory. Everything (or many things) may have been loaded into memory at the start. Then items that were not longer needed were removed from memory by the GC. Usually generation can take more memory in progress and lose some afterwards, for example temporary data-structures can be used in progress but are not longer needed when the process is done.</p>

<p>It's also possible that items in memory where swapped out and written to the disk temporally (and may be later retrieved), this swapping this is done by your OS and tends to be used more on programs that reserve a lot of memory.   </p>
