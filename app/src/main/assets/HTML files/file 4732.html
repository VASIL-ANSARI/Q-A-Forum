<p>I see 2 completely different pics.</p>

<p>One has a story button, the other doesnt.
One has a singlew-line textbox, the other a multi-line.
And then there's the thing that your screenshots are too dark...</p>

<p>Or to put it in other words, you've really tried your best to make it very unclear for other people.</p>
