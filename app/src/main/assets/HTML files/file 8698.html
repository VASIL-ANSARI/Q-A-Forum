<p>Several thoughts for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>'Turn off' the rendering to see how much of the response time is in server-side querying. You can do this by commenting out DataSoource= statements.</li>
<li>Browsers tend to wait until an entire table has made it before rendering any of it. You might try different layouts such that not everything is in a single table. Maybe a repeater where each item is a stand-alone table? Each can then render as the markup appears.</li>
<li>You can start to get a lot more fancy with jQuery and AJAX to page your content. Instead of 100 rows maybe 10 rows with page 1, 2, 3... links?</li>
</ol>
