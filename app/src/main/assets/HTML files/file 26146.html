<p>I ran into the same problem, and for the same reason, setting a custom font in a label. My strategy was a little more general, though. My custom font is Helvetica-like, so I used Helvetica Neue in IB as a placeholder font. The UILabel subclass translated that to my custom font, preserving font size and weight, so I could control all that through IB.</p>

<p>That made my workaround for the translation bug (I assume it's a bug) easier. I traverse all my views recursively in viewDidLoad, and map all UILabel fonts if they match the placeholder font, and the same for UIButton in my case.</p>

<p>Have you filed a bug?</p>
