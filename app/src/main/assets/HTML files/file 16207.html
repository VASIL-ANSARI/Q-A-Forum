<p>According to <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/security/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> there are only Windows-MY and Windows-ROOT as possible certificate store providers for windows. The Azure-managed certificates are stored in the local machines personal certificates and therefore don't seem to be accessible through the Keystore API.</p>

<p>As a workaround you could either try to get the certificate via native apis (e.g. via JNI or <a href="https://github.com/twall/jna" rel="nofollow">jna</a>) or write a wrapper executable (e.g. written in native c++ or .net) which provides the required certificate to your java process.</p>
