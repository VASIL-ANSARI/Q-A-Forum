<p>You can use <code>left join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select t1.*,
       (case when t2.id is null then 'False' else 'True' end) as ComputedColumn
from t1 left join
     t2
     on t1.id = t2.t1_id and t2.somenumber = 180;
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, that assumes that a row with <code>180</code> occurs at most once for each id (as in your sample data).  If such rows could occur multiple times, use <code>case</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select t1.*,
       (case when exists (select 1 from t2 where t1.id = t2.t1_id and t2.somenumber = 180)
             then 'True' else 'False'
        end) as ComputedColumn
from t1;
</code></pre>
