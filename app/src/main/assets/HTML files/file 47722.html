<p>Unfortunately you can't know what caused the app's suspension. Unlike the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows.applicationmodel.activation.launchactivatedeventargs.aspx" rel="nofollow">LaunchActivatedEventArgs</a> in the <code>OnLaunched</code> method for example, that contain the <code>Kind</code> property the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.suspendingeventargs.aspx" rel="nofollow">SuspendingEventArgs</a> in the <code>OnSuspending</code> method don't provide any such information. </p>

<p>However, there are only so many reasons that an app can be suspended. Like you said (in windows phone only) it can be suspended due to a launch of a launcher or a protocol and by the windows button. </p>

<p>The windows button is the only suspension way of which you have no control. For all the others you can trick the system and for example set a static global variable that you update when you launch an operation that would suspend your app and check it in <code>OnSuspending</code></p>
