<p>The <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> format was designed in response to the need for Python documentation that could be embedded in docstrings, so the best thing is to <strong>learn reST and format your docstrings with that format</strong>. You might find, as I did, that you then go on to format just about <em>any</em> documentation in reST, but that's a side point :-)</p>

<p>For specifically documenting your Python code, the <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> system is a set of extensions to the reST format, and a build system for rendering documents. Since it was designed to document Python itself, including the standard library, <strong>Sphinx allows for very well-structured documentation of source code</strong>, including of course the specifics of function signatures as you're asking. It allows a comprehensive documentation suite to be built, both auto-extracted and hand-written, all using the same formatting system.</p>

<p>If you <em>only</em> want documentation generated from your source code, then <strong><a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a> will extract API documentation from your source code</strong>; it, too, reads reST formatting for the text.</p>
