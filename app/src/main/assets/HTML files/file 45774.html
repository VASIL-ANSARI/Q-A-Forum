<p>I think your problem in linked to the way you store values. You are using a 2-dimensions array of chars, so it's normal you obtain only chars! You should better define a structure which fields should be of the type of each column (in order int, char, float, float, float).
Then, you should store it as a 1-dimension array of struct.
You can still use fscanf, but you should do one call per struct field, with a corresponding pattern for each's type.</p>
