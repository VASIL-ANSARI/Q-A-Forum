<p>Your question indicates a misunderstanding of MVC. You've asked "why would it be faster for the <em>model</em> to cache data rather than a <em>controller</em>." Controller don't hold data at all, so it doesn't matter how fast it would or wouldn't be. The model holds data. And in a Core Data app, the model is tied to a persistent store.</p>

<p>The fact that persistent stores can be in memory makes coding extremely convenient, since callers don't have to worry about how the data is stored. In your example, callers would need to behave differently (deal with different classes) for data stored in a local store versus a remote store. Core Data abstracts that away, making it easy to move your store wherever you want it.</p>
