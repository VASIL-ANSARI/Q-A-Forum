<p>Yes you're second Runnable will be ran on a new thread not the UI thread.</p>

<p>When you do <code>new Handler();</code> this creates a handle to the current thread, if this code was in <code>onCreate</code> that thread would be the UI thread.</p>

<p>Therefore when you do <code>handler.post</code> it will post onto the UI thread (runnable1) , but when you start runnable2 you are explicitly creating a new thread to run this on.</p>

<p>It might not be the right strategy to create a new thread every 1 second (<code>postDelayed ..1000</code>) perhaps keep a reference to another background thread and post it a message every second to do something new.</p>

<hr>

<p>To stop your repeated runnables you need to call <code>removeCallbacks(runnable1)</code> in <code>onPause</code> of any Activity (that I assume called <code>postDelayed</code> in <code>onCreate</code>)</p>
