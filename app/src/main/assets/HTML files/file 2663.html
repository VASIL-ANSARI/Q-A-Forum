<p>OK I found out how to do it - quite simple really!</p>

<pre><code>CPLineStyle *borderLineStyle = [CPLineStyle lineStyle];
borderLineStyle.lineColor = [CPColor whiteColor];
borderLineStyle.lineWidth = 1.0;

graph.plotArea.borderLineStyle = borderLineStyle;
</code></pre>

<p>where graph is your graph object - the reason I had a border in the first place was because I used CPPlainWhiteTheme.</p>

<p>Hope this helps others - is there a better way?</p>
