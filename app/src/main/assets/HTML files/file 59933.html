<p>I believe that you haven't included the JQuery file? You have to download it first <a href="https://jquery.com/download/" rel="nofollow">https://jquery.com/download/</a>, and then register it as you did with "custom_script", you just have to put it before the "custom_script" in functions.php, inside "custom_script.js" you could also do:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

});
</code></pre>

<p>Go to your console and if you see:</p>

<p>Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined</p>

<p>It's because you haven't included the JQuery file as needed.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!
