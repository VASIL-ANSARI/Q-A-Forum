<p>The difference is that in the first case, you end up with a non-array object because you created it with <code>{}</code> (an object initializer), and in the second case you end up with an array (which is also an object) because you created it with <code>[]</code> (an array initializer). So in the second case, you'll have the magic <code>length</code> property, the various things provided by <code>Array.prototype</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Typically, you would only use an array when you need those array-specific features.</p>

<p>The reason you can define <code>newProperty1</code> on the array is that arrays are objects, and so you can add properties to them. In fact, normal arrays like the one you're using in your second example <a href="http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2011/01/myth-of-arrays.html" rel="nofollow">aren't really arrays at all</a> <em>(links to a post on my anemic little blog)</em>, they're just objects backed by <code>Array.prototype</code> with a couple of special features.</p>
