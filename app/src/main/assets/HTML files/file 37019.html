<p>I was playing around with your Fiddle, and the first thing that comes to mind is we need to make an absolutely positioned background for your side nav.</p>

<p>You can add this outside your wrapper:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="left-bg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this css:</p>

<pre><code>.left-bg {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color:rgba(0,0,255,0.5);
    width:100px;
    z-index: -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Height doesn't work the same with Floats, you can also Absolutely position your content wrapper and the side nav and it should have 100% height that way, then use min-height to cause your footer to stop and not cover the content in your nav.</p>

<hr>

<p>As Joseph said in the comments, it is better in this scenario to use 'position: fixed;' compared to 'position: absolute;'</p>
