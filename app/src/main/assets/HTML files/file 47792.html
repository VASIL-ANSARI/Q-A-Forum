<p>If you're taking a complex type in as a parameter to your Web API controller and accessing it via GET, you need to tell the controller that it can create the object from the querystring parameters sent across in the request. Add the <code>[FromUri]</code> attribute and your object should be created fine:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
[Route("SsoRedirect")]     
public IHttpActionResult SsoRedirect([FromUri]UserModel myUser)
{
    ....
}
</code></pre>
