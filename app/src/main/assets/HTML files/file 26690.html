<p>It's called "sign extension" and it's there exactly in order to have the effect of dividing by two. If the leftmost bit became 0, the sign of the originally negative number would change into positive. If only the leftmost bit was kept one, and further bits changed to zero, the result would have nothing to do with division by two.</p>

<p>If you want zeros to be prepended on the left, there is a special operator for that: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>NB Java has only one <em>unsigned</em> integer quantity, and it is <code>char</code>. On this data type, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> works by prepending zeros on the left.</p>
