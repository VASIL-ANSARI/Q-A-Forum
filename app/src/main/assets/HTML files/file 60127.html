<p>Before asking this question, I am assuming that you have not searched the net for anything at all, let alone MySQL documentation. Because I have asked stupid questions in the past (without researching enough), I am going to answer this one. By the way, this is a habit you must work upon. You should search for material, read and try solutions to your problems before coming to Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Here's a snapshot from <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/join.html" rel="nofollow">Official MySQL Documentation</a>:</p>

<p>Apart from this, here are a few links that would help you understand JOINs, in general:</p>

</ol>

<p>I think this would suffice for the basic knowledge of JOINs. You'd have to read more about what JOIN to use when - based on the data you want to fetch and also how your database management system (in this case, MySQL) <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/optimizer-determining-join-type.html" rel="nofollow">works with JOINs internally to optimize performance</a>.</p>
