<p>Perhaps the validation error occurs when attaching the object as you do.  Does the same error ocur when you do it somehow like this?</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public PartialViewResult IncrementRating(int compareId)
{
    var comparison = db.Comparisons.SingleOrDefault(o =&gt; o.id == comapreId);

    comparison.Rating += 1;
    //Other edit sutff......
    //db.Comparisons.Attach(comparison);

    db.SaveChanges();

    return PartialView("_Voting", comparison);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know, this should have been a comment rather than answer but it came out as a comment not good for reading.</p>
