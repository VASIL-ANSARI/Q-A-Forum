<p>One way of doing it, not exactly transparently, would be to do the chunking on the client, so getting the count of the total rows and use the LIMIT keyword in the query combined with a loop to launch multiple queries for a chunk size that has acceptable memory usage. You'd have to be sure that the table contents was not changing in the meantime to be able to do that.</p>
