  <p>..save the contents of a canvas to a BufferedImage without calling paint()? </p>

<p>Draw the content to a <code>BufferedImage</code> prior to drawing the image to the <code>Canvas</code>.  When it comes time to save, simply use the cached image.</p>

<p>And think about joining us in the 3rd millennium and using Swing components.  Use <code>JPanel</code> &amp; <code>paintComponent(Graphics)</code> instead of the <code>Canvas</code> &amp; <code>paint(Graphics)</code>.</p>
