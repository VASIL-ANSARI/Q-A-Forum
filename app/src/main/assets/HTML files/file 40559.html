<p>With a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM 
(
    SELECT CompanyID, count(CompanyID) as CompanyCount
    FROM Products 
    GROUP by CompanyID
) CompanyCounts
INNER JOIN Companies
on CompanyCounts.CompanyId = Companies.CompanyID
</code></pre>

<p>If you need this in more places, you may want to create a view for company count.</p>
