<p>According to Apache documentation, it looks like relative paths simply aren't supported: (<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html" rel="nofollow">https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The syntax of the ErrorDocument directive is:</p>
  
  <p>ErrorDocument &lt;<em>3-digit-code</em>> &lt;<em>action</em>></p>
  
  <p>where the action will be treated as:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>A local URL to redirect to (if the action begins with a "/"). </p></li>
  <li><p>An external URL to redirect to (if the action is a valid URL). </p></li>
  <li><p>Text to be
  displayed (if none of the above). The text must be wrapped in quotes
  (") if it consists of more than one word.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if you read further down in the documentation, it sounds like you can pass additional data to the redirected URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redirecting to another URL can be useful, but only if some information can be passed which can then be used to explain or log the error condition more clearly.</p>
  
  <p>To achieve this, when the error redirect is sent, additional environment variables will be set, which will be generated from the headers provided to the original request by prepending 'REDIRECT_' onto the original header name. This provides the error document the context of the original request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the documentation for all of the redirect information available. You might find something useful there. </p>

<p>Perhaps you redirect all 404s to some sort of controller that redirects the user to the correct 404 page via PHP, given the additional redirect information.</p>
