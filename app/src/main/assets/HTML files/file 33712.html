<p>This code can never return 0. rand() always return a number between 0 and RAND_MAX. </p>

<p>The modulo operation return a value between 0 and 2. Adding 1 results in what you want.
No need for parenthesis. Modulo ranks above addition. </p>

<p>You don't have to add srand(0), but if you do it, you get always the same sequence of numbers. Read  the docs.</p>
