<p>Scenario 1 is awful.  Unfortunately I know all too well the problems of working with Java/PHP developers who are learning python.  </p>

<p>Perhaps you can compromise with those guys by proposing the use of <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/" rel="nofollow">python enums</a> to address their concern.  These are built-in in python 3.4+, and have been <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34" rel="nofollow">backported</a> as far back as 2.4.  </p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum

class Constant(Enum):
    name = "name"
    surname = "surname"
    zipcode = "zipcode"
    city = "city"
    created = "created"
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can change the "values", say for example changing zipcode to be "potato" in the enum definition, whilst still using the name <code>Constant.zipcode.value</code> everywhere else in source code.  </p>
