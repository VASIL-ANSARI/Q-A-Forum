<p>The entities should only have the attributes which are actually having an impact on the database.
The DTOs should not have any attributes for validation except for the DataMemberAttribute to define if a property is required and in which order it should be displayed etc. For OData you also have to set the KeyAttribute. 
The models should have the validation attributes. Because the DTOs and the models are probably almost identical you create for each dto which needs to be validated a model and just swap the dto's value to the model's object. Now you can validate it, if you are not using ValidationAttributes for the models you can validate them for example with <a href="https://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">FluentValidation</a></p>

<p>So long story short:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Entities only get the attributes which actually impact the database's schema</p></li>
<li><p>DTOs are simple objects with no validation logic, except for the DataMemberAttribute</p></li>
<li><p>Models should have the validation attributes (only if needed, not needed when using FluentValidation)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The workflow for POST will be:
-> DTO comes in -> Swap dto to Model -> Validate the model -> Swap model to entity -> Store entity in database -> Use the updated entity and swap it to a new dto -> Return the dto</p>
