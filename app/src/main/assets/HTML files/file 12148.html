<p>Jquery <code>serialize()</code> serializes as UTF-8.  So <code>รยก</code> becomes the correct UTF-8 encoding <code>%c3%a1</code>.    Try using the <code>$_REQUEST</code> as that is already decoded as per the php documentation. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.urldecode.php" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
