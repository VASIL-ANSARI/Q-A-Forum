<p>Those two things are <strong>fundamentally different</strong>. The former is a <em>field</em> of a delegate type while the latter is really a method. The tiniest difference I can think of is that you can modify the first one dynamically at runtime and assign another method reference to it while the second is fixed.</p>

<p>You shouldn't normally prefer the first over the second if your purpose is to write a simple method for a class in C#.</p>

<p>An example that makes the first extremely fragile:</p>

<pre><code>var c = new SomeClass();
c.SampleMethod = inputParam =&gt; inputParam.ToLower();
c.DoSomeTaskThatReliesOnSampleMethodReturningAnUpperCaseString();
c.SampleMethod = null;
c.DoSomeTaskThatCallsSampleMethod(); // NullReferenceException
</code></pre>

<p>This style of programming is common in language like Javascript where an object is fundamentally a dynamic creature built upon a simple dictionary.</p>
