<p>A few thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are you sure your <code>CBPeripheralManager</code> instance is not going out of scope or being overwritten and garbage collected, that your ViewController remains in the foreground and the screen is not locked?</p></li>
<li><p>Try using another transmitter app like the free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/locate-beacon/id738709014?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Locate</a> app to verify it is not a  device specific issue.  </p></li>
<li><p>If the Locate app works on the same device, then there must be something else in your app that is interfering with the broadcast at a later time.  Perhaps you can share code on Github or elsewhere so others can test.  </p></li>
</ol>
