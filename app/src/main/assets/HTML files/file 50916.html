<p>I mainly use chrome and I've noticed it throws in the URL for links that get printed. Sortable tables usually have links in the heading and the path appears to be getting printed by your friendly browser. You might look at a print stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code>.visable-print {
    display: none;
}
@media print {
    .hidden-print {
        display: none;
    }
    .visable-print {
        display: inline !important;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You essentially want to hide the part of the table with a link and replace replace it with just the name for printing when the media query is for print.</p>
