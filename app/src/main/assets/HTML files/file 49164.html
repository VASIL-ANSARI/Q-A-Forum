<p>I think black box is <code>UIImageView</code> and you're trying it to place in screen as in the picture. </p>

<p>You can put the imageview in storyboard, in xib or in code to right side of screen. Then rotate it. For example below code rotates the imageview 20 degress.</p>

<pre><code>float degrees = 20; //the value in degrees
imageView.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(degrees * M_PI/180); 
</code></pre>
