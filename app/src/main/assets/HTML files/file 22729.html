<p>You can setup your own local server and connect browser to it. Something has to open connection and something has to listen for connections. So automatically your python client turns into server however it sounds. </p>

<p>Anyway, why you are not using just javascript? Most things can be done with lone js.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: </p>

<p>You can also just forget about html and javascript and make everything in python. Check <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download" rel="nofollow">PyQt4</a>, you can make pretty easly your own gui to check images with it.</p>
