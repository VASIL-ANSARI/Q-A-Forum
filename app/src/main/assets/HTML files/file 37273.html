<p>The rotation methods are deprecated in the iOS 8 SDK. This will have no effect at all on apps built with the iOS 7 SDK, even running in iOS 8 and probably several future versions of iOS.</p>

<p>As an example, the <code>font</code> property of <code>UIButton</code> has been deprecated since iOS 3.0 and is still available in iOS 7.0.</p>
