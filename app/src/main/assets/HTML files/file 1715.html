<p>You can construct the data you want from this table: <a href="http://www.datelib.de/Timezones.shtml.en" rel="nofollow">http://www.datelib.de/Timezones.shtml.en</a>. You would simply group by the Country code column. Probably the best way to go would be to throw all this data into a database table and use some AJAX magic to handle select menu onchange events.</p>
