<p>Right now that's not possible in PyDev, and I'm not sure it'd be so useful -- if there's some parameter you have to pass to 200 scripts, the usual way to have that configuration would not be as command line arguments, but usually through an environment variables or some configuration file (whose default location would be something as ~/.my_app in Linux or using %APPDATA%/MyApp in windows).</p>

<p>If you have a use-case that differs from that for some reason, please create a feature request in PyDev (see: <a href="http://pydev.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://pydev.org/about.html</a> for links) explaining your use-case.</p>

<p>If you decide to go through the environment variables way, you can set it up in the shell where you start Eclipse (but before starting Eclipse and you must restart Eclipse if you change it) or in the interpreter configuration (window > preferences > pydev > interpreter - Python > environment).</p>
