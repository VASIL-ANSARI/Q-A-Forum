<p>I'll assume that your existing code is enough for getting the time and value. Thus you will have these items in whatever variable or data structure you choose to use. For the purposes of this answer, I will assume these values already exist in the individual variables: <code>$time</code>, <code>$value[0]</code>, <code>$value[1]</code>, and <code>$value[2]</code>. Further, I will assume that the results are being loaded into the array <code>$timesAndValues[]</code></p>

<p>I think the key is to have the <code>$timesAndValues[]</code> array indexed on the corresponding time:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($timesAndValues[$time]))
{ //The corresponding sub-array already exists, so we just need to load it

  //Push the array of values into the sub-array 
  array_push($timesAndValues[$time], $value);
}
else
{ //The corresponding sub-array does not exist yet, so we need to create it and load it

  //Create the sub-array
  $timesAndValues[$time] = array($time);

  //Push the array of values into the sub-array
  array_push($timesAndValues[$time], $value);
}
</code></pre>
