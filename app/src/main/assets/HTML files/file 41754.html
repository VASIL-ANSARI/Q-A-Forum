<p>Well for that particular case you'd have to ask the author of the class.</p>

<p>But in general using <code>std::string</code> in an exception is a little bit dangerous. This is because its constructor can throw an exception itself, and when the constructor of an exception throws an exception again, the program is terminated without giving you further opportunity to handle these exceptions.</p>
