<p>This looks inelegant to me. What you are really interested in is stripping everything up and including the number. So how about something like this.</p>

<pre><code>for s in my_List:
    result = re.match(r".*\d+\w(.*)", s)
    print result.group(1)
</code></pre>

<p>which gives you, via the (1), the matched group in the (.*). </p>
