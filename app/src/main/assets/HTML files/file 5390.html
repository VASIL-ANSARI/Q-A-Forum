<p>initWithRTF: is a method of NSAttributedString; NSString won't respond to that selector and will return nil, so you have to just change the class name to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Your compiler must have warned you there - I would advise you not to ignore compiler warnings, it saves a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>Also, nil should be only used in place for id - since this is not the case for the document attributes you ought to use NULL there instead.</p>
