<p>Apparently this error was being caused because my plugin was doing all this on the <code>init</code> hook. It seems that setting the terms sometimes instantiated a new request, which triggered the init action twice, causing my plugin to run again, and become stuck in infinite recursion.</p>

<p>Switching to <code>parse_request</code> hook, and listening for a <code>$_GET</code> variable for doing the processing, fixed the issue.</p>
