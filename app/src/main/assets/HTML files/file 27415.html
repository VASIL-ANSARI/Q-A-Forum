<p>You either didn't link OpenGL correctly or don't have the correct version of OpenGL installed. I'd go for the second since the functions it is complaining about are functions that are not present in OpenGL 2.x and were introduced in OpenGL 3.x.</p>

<p>If you are on Max OSX, 99% it is the second, since only Mavericks (the latest OS) have OpenGL 3.x+ installed.</p>
