<p>I believe your issue is you are resetting the innerHTML in the function call. I assume this function is called every time files are uploaded?</p>

<pre><code>function handleFileSelect(e) {
    if (!e.target.files) return;
    selDiv.innerHTML = ""; // &lt;--- this will empty the div
    var files = e.target.files;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {
        var f = files[i];
        selDiv.innerHTML += f.name + "&lt;br/&gt;";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have uploaded files, then called this function and displayed them and then upload more files and call this function it will constantly reset the innerHTML. I believe if you remove that line it will continue to append the uploaded files without overwriting the previous ones.</p>
