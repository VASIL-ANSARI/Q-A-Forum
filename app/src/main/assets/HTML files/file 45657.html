<p>The code you showed should be included with script tag as you tried. After that you need to add link element in your HTML and click that. So your <em>index.html</em> would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="cordova.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    window.addEventListener('load', function () {
      $(document).on('click', 'a[target="_system"],a[target="_blank"]', function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var url = this.href;
        window.open(url,"_system");
      });
    }, false);
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://google.com/" target="_system"&gt;Go to Google.com&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What the script actually does is that it registers itself as event handler for <em>click</em> event so basically it is called every time some link with <em>target="_system"</em> or <em>target="_blank"</em> is clicked. When it is called, it first prevents any other event handlers for it from being executed (<em>e.preventDefault();</em>). After that it reads the URL for the link clicked and opens that with the external browser (<em>window.open(url, "_system");</em>).</p>
