<p>It's probably the fonts. Please try changing only the font used in your app. Use an included iOS font. If the label displays correctly by just changing the fonts used, it is the font's fault. If not, post the code so we can track down the problem.</p>

<p>You can edit fonts with a number of programs such as Fontlab, Fontographer, TypeTool, FontForge, etc. As BobC mentions in a comment, there may be licensing issues.</p>
