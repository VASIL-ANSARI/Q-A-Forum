<p>you'd fetch from the cursor like :</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
  for r_row in C1(PROCEDURE_PARAM)
  loop
    dbms_output.put_line(r_row.col1);--or whatever you want to do here.
  end loop;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>though i usually prefer to write these inline as</p>

<pre><code>begin
  for r_row in (SELECT COL1, COL2, MY_FUNCTION1(P1), 
                       SUM(COL3), MY_FUNCTION2(P1,P2)
                       COL4, MY_FUNCTION(P1,P2,P3,P4)
                  FROM TABLE_1
                 WHERE COL1 = PROCEDURE_PARAM 
                 GROUP BY COL1, COL2, COL4
                 ORDER BY COL2)
  loop
    ...
  end loop;
</code></pre>

<p>just so I don't have to scroll up to a cursor def to see what it was actually doing.</p>
