<p>In Tastypie you have to define all relational fields in ModelResources definition. So if you got some let say foreign key in model you have to define that foreign key again in model resource. The reason for that is Tastypie has to know how to deal if it. Has to know serialization, authorization, authentication, etc for it. Other ways the field be ignored. You have to pass that related resource and that's it.</p>

<pre><code>class StatementResource(ModelResource):
    Client = fields.ForeignKey(ClientResource, 'Client')
    class Meta:
        queryset = Statement.objects.all()
        resource_name = 'client'
        allowed_methods = ['get']
        include_resource_uri = False
</code></pre>
