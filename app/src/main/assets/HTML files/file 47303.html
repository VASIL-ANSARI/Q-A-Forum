<p>You could write a C# Console Application which accepts command-line arguments, then call this using the Shell command. </p>

<p>Here's a sample Console application which handles the input parameters:
    using System;</p>

<pre><code>namespace ConsoleAppWithParams
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Number of command line parameters = {0}",
               args.Length);
            foreach (string s in args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(s);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the parameters are coming from the command-line, so they are strings. You'd need to validate and convert the parameters if you need other data types. </p>

<p>You can call this from Excel VBA as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Sub UseCSharpApp()
    Shell "D:\Documents\ConsoleAppWithParams.exe Tom Dick Harry"
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>If your C# application is fairly straightforward, then the only requirement would be for it to be copied to the expected directory, and for the correct version (or a more recent version) of the .NET Framework to be installed on the PC. If the C# app is written to target .NET Framework 2.0, then it's likely that most Windows PCs in a business environment would be able to use this, but obviously you should check whether that's the case in your environment.</p>

<p>Note that with this approach, you're limited to passing in values when first calling the application. This wouldn't be a useful solution in all scenarios, but might work if that's all you need to do. </p>
