<p>Likely you are not part of the role DBO or DDLAdmin on the database.  Talk to your friendly DBA to see if he can your SQL Server user those permissions.  If he isn't comfortable giving you those roles see if he grant you alter table.  Other possibilities are you in the right database/server?  Does this table really exist? </p>
