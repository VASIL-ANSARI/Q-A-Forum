<p>I'd suggest to avoid mixing right and left outer join.
Your central table is Project, so use it first.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  dbo.project.projectcode, 
        dbo.project.client, 
        dbo.project.project, 
        dbo.project.budget, 
        dbo.project.budget * 80 AS value, 
        SUM(dbo.harvest.hours) AS hourslogged, 
        SUM(dbo.salesforce.value) AS invoiced
FROM    dbo.project      
            LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.salesforce
                ON dbo.salesforce.projectcode = dbo.project.projectcode 
            LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.harvest 
                ON dbo.project.projectcode = dbo.harvest.projectcode
GROUP BY    dbo.project.projectcode, 
            dbo.project.project, 
            dbo.project.client, 
            dbo.project.budget
</code></pre>

<p>But the error come from the GROUP BY. You don't have to group by the two tables on which you are doing the aggregate, else your aggregate will not be good !</p>
