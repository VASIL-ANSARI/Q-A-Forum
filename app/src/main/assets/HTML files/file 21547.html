<p>This depends on how you built the project. </p>

<p>If you built the project from an existing makefile, your library paths and libraries should be present in the build environment. </p>

<p>If you built the project by hand by piece-mealing the source, include, and libraries in individually, you will need to <em>explicitly</em> add the libraries that you want. </p>

<p>Specifically, looking at your updated build log, it appears you're not <em>linking</em> the required library and instead added it as a target somehow.</p>

<p>Right click on your project, go to <code>Properties</code>, under the <code>Build</code> tab look toward <code>Linker</code>, Here is where you should specify your link path and your dynamic/static libraries. </p>
