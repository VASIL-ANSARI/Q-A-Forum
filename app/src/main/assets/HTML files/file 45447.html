<p>I've had similar problem.</p>

<p>You can make it fullscreen again by requesting it from your JavaScript code. You can use <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/" rel="nofollow">screenfull.js</a> library:</p>

<pre><code>if (screenfull.enabled) {
    screenfull.request();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was to complicated for my project, so I ended up not using fullscreen mode, but I've added new attribute in my Crosswalk/template/AndroidManifest.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"
</code></pre>

<p>This way, my app will not shrink when soft keyboard pops-up.</p>
