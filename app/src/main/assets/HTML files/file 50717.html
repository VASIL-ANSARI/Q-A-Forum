<p>You should only redirect to the <code>http://</code> if you don't know the protocol because it is REALLY the responsibility of the receiving website to have a redirect setup form HTTP to HTTPS.</p>

<p>Therefore if the user doesn't specify a protocol, you simply add the non-secure http protocol and it <em>should</em> get redirected to the correct page.</p>

<p>You <em>should not</em> be inserting <code>www</code> at all if the user hasn't put that in.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, you could always perform a check yourself in your own code to see which protocols exist at the other end, but you should probably simple enforce the user supply it in the first place</p>
