<p>Could it be that you are not minimizing the right tensor?
You are minimizing cross_entropy, but should be cross_entropy_mean (accuracy in your code).</p>

<p>Basically with the following logic:</p>

<p>cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
      logits, ground_truth_placeholder)</p>

<p>cross_entropy_mean = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)</p>

<p>train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(FLAGS.learning_rate).minimize(
      cross_entropy_mean)</p>
