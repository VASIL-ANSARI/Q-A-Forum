<p>According to Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> on <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Stylesheet loads block script execution, so if you have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> after a <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" ...&gt;</code>, the page will not finish parsing - and <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> will not fire - until the stylesheet is loaded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it appears that you are experiencing the expected behavior such that <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> is not fired until after your external web font is fully downloaded.</p>
