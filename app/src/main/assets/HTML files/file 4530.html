<p>A resultSet is not the typical means for updating through JDBC. (Normally insert, update statements are used.)</p>

<p>There is a paragraph in the tutorial link that you posted that explains the default result set is read only.  It says:</p>

<p><strong>The default ResultSet concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY.
    Note: Not all JDBD drivers and databases support concurrency. The method DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency returns true if the specified concurrency level is supported by the driver and false otherwise.</strong></p>
