<p>It depends on what you want to do but you can lookup wiEngine for Android SDK, at the transitions example... take a look at the code thought the documentation is in chinese, you can simply read the code.</p>

<p>Also take a look at Chet Haase blog for some tips, <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/</a> he has a bunch of stuff related to animation. Targeting API level12 that would take just about one line of code using the method objectToAnimate.rotateYBy(360).setDuration(250f) </p>
