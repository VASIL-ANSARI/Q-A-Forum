<p>I think you have to split the <code>if</code> statements:</p>

<pre><code>if '.gds' in string:
    a = string.split('.gds')
elif '.cdl' in string:
    a = string.split('.cdl')
else:
    a = string # this is a fallback in case none of the patterns is in the string
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, your <code>in</code> statement is incorrect; it should have been</p>

<pre><code>if '.gds' in string or '.cdl' in string:
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this solution assumes that only one of the patterns will be in the string. If both patterns can occur on the same string, see Vikas's answer.</p>
