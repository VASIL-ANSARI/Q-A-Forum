<p>In you case i would just alter a little the showing of the list. First in the list model redefine the to_param method</p>

<pre><code>    def to_param
      long_string_shared_key_goes #by default this was returning the id - example...to access show a list you had to navigate to /lists/:id
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Now you need to change the routes.rb</p>

<pre><code>    match 'public/:long_string_shared_key_goes', to :'lists#show', via: [:get]
</code></pre>

<p>Now you just have to change some find methods (if you are accessing the lists with example list.find(params[:id] you now have to take in consideration that you dont have the id in the params, but you long_string_shared_key).</p>

<p>Hope this answered your question.</p>
