<p>This is pretty hard to answer because it's so application-specific, but here are a few guidelines I use:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put as little as possible in the session.</li>
<li>User-specific selections that should only last during a given visit are a good choice</li>
<li>often, variables that need to be accessible to multiple pages throughout the user's visit to your site (to avoid passing them from page to page) are also good to put in the session.</li>
</ol>

<p>From what little you've said about your application, I'd probably select your data from the db and try to find ways to minimize the impact of those queries instead of loading down the session.</p>
