<p>25600016 bytes, is a 25 Mb you're asking to load into memory, or equivalent of a 6 mpixel image with <code>ARGB_8888</code> <code>Bitmap.Config</code>. It's way to big to load, you need to downsample (see <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html#load-bitmap" rel="nofollow">inSampleSize</a>) and read <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>. In your case you should <strong>UIL</strong> to downscale the image. I see also that you explicitly set the <code>Bitmap.Config</code> to <code>RGB_565</code> which means that you actually are dealing with an even larger image, 12 mpixel image?</p>
