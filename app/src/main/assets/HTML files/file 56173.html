<p>Here's the relevant code (assuming <code>objs</code> is the object array and <code>ids</code> is the id array)</p>

<pre><code>_.filter(objs, function(obj) {
  return _.includes(ids, obj.ID);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Logically, you're filtering a set based on member keys included in another set.</p>
