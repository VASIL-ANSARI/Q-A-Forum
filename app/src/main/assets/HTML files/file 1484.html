<p>You could try using standard library module <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html?highlight=zlib#module-zlib" rel="nofollow">zlib</a> directly -- that's what <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/gzip.html?highlight=gzip#module-gzip" rel="nofollow">gzip</a> uses for the compress/decompress part.  If the whole packet isn't liked by the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html?highlight=zlib#zlib.decompress" rel="nofollow">decompress</a> function, you can try using different values of <code>wbits</code> and/or slicing off a few bytes off the packet's front (if you could "reverse engineer" exactly <strong>how</strong> the Java code is compressing that packet -- even just understand how many <code>wbits</code> is using, or whether it's putting out any prefix before the compressed data -- that would help immensely, of course).</p>

<p>The only likely "damage" you might have done to the file itself would be, on windows, if you had written it without specifying <code>'wb'</code> to use binary mode -- writing it in "text mode" on windows would make the file unusable. Just saying...!-)</p>
