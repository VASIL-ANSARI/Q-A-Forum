<blockquote>
  <p>First, you need to establish a connection with the data source you
  want to use. A data source can be a DBMS, a legacy file system, or
  some other source of data with a corresponding JDBC driver. Typically,
  a JDBC application connects to a target data source using one of two
  classes:  </p>
  
  <p>â¢ <strong>DriverManager:</strong> This fully implemented class connects an
  application to a data source, which is specified by a database URL.
  When this class first attempts to establish a connection, it
  automatically loads any JDBC 4.0 drivers found within the class path.
  Note that your application must manually load any JDBC drivers prior
  to version 4.0.   </p>
  
  <p>â¢ <strong>DataSource</strong>: This interface is preferred over
  DriverManager because it allows details about the underlying data
  source to be transparent to your application. A DataSource object's
  properties are set so that it represents a particular data source. See 
  Connecting with DataSource Objects for more information. For more
  information about developing applications with the DataSource class,
  see the latest The Java EE Tutorial.</p>
