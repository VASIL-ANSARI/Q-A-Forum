<p>SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS is code page 1252
While your text file is UTF-8</p>

<p>I see everyone telling me to use UTF-8 or 16 etc, but I just ran into this issue with writing a clr to encrypt data.  I wrote it with UTF-8 based on everything I read, I was able to troubleshoot and determine that the code page was 1252 based on some other web searches.</p>

<p>Here is SO post on it check out @dunos answer
