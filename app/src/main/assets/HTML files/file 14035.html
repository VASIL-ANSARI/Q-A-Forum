<p>Assuming your RDMS doesn't support window functions,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.*
FROM table1 a
INNER JOIN 
(
  SELECT name,MAX(date) as max_date -- date field may need escaping
  FROM table1 a
  GROUP BY name
)b ON (b.name = a.name AND a.date=b.max_date)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Following <strong>Dems</strong> comment, if date+name is not unique, but you want to see a name just once,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT c.name,c.date, MAX(c.score) as max_score
FROM
(
 SELECT a.* 
 FROM table1 a
 INNER JOIN 
 (
  SELECT name,MAX(date) as max_date -- date field may need escaping
  FROM table1 a
  GROUP BY name
 )b ON (b.name = a.name AND a.date=b.max_date)
)c
</code></pre>
