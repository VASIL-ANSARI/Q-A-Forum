<p>Functions declared within other functions are ONLY available within the function in which they are declared.  They are like local variables in that regard.  They are private to the scope in which they are declared and there is no way to access them from the outside.</p>

<p>If you want it available in a higher scope, then declare the function in the higher scope or assign it to a higher scope and then you can call it from both places.</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    f1();//OK
    f2();//OK
});

function f1(){
    console.log("1");
}
function f2(){
    console.log("2");
}

f2();//OK
f1();//OK
</code></pre>

<p>It's also possible to do this (manually assigning a function into the global scope):</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    // assign function into the top level scope
    window.f1 = function(){
        console.log("1");
    }

    f1();//OK
    f2();//OK
});

function f2(){
    console.log("2");
}

f2();//OK
f1();//OK - only after document is ready and window.f1 has been assigned
</code></pre>
