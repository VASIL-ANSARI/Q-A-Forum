<p>Not an easy task.</p>

<p>For the colored case, you should start by separating the color planes. There is some chance that you can get the markers apart.</p>

<p>But for the b&amp;w case, there is no escape, you must go deeper.</p>

<p>I would try to detect the grid lines first, for example using a Hough line detector, as accurately as possible. Then erase those lines.</p>

<p>Then try to find the crosses, which are short oblique line segments (most of the time broken by the previous operations).</p>

<p>The circles might be detected by a Hough circle detector, using a small range of radii.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a rige or edge detector can be used to get short segments and short curved arcs. You may have to add some filtering criteria to avoid the joining lines.</p>
