<p>In my opinion is pointless to have queries that return 3 million records. What would you do with them? There is no meaning to present them to the user and if you want to do some calculations it is better to run more than one queries that return considerably fewer records.</p>

<p>Using LIMIT is one solution, but a better solution would be to restructure your database and application so that you can have "smarter" queries that do not return everything in one go. For example you could return records based on a date column. This way you could have the most recent ones.</p>
