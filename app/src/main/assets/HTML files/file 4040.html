<p>I recommend jinja2 templates over django: <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">http://jinja.pocoo.org/</a> It's based on the django templates but more powerful and easy to use. I don't think it's a good idea to use Django templates without the django stack. Also, if you want a more structured framework, a VERY nice minimalist framework is Flask: <a href="http://www.pocoo.org/projects/flask/#flask">http://www.pocoo.org/projects/flask/#flask</a>. I can't praise those two libraries enough. I worked a long time in Django and found this combo to be very refreshing and succinct.</p>

<p>P.S. this should be a very simple process to port over. It took me 10 minutes to port over a webapp site when I just found out about Flask.</p>
