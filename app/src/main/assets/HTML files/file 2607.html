<p>Finally worked this one out after about an hour of paired coding.</p>

<p>After a while We noticed that <strong>tableView was always null</strong> whenever we sent the reloadData message.
As you may know in Objective C, null objects accept any message without complaint.</p>

<p>It turns out that "someone" (ahem, sorry it was me) had defined this line in the header file.</p>

<pre><code> UITableView *tableView;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you smart cookies out there will know that because we extend UITaleViewController, <strong>we do not need to make a pointer to tableView ourselves</strong>. In effect I had replaced the inherited tableView member with a null object.</p>

<p>Mystery solved. Hopefully this helps someone else out there too! :D</p>
