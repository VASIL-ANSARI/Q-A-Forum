<p>if you want to switch your content dinamically, you have to load data via ajax and then replace the right column of your site...Razor don't have a "automatic mode" to do that. =P</p>

<p>I have some projects using this 'approach'. I render my views as partials views (in controller) and then I get the html and put where I want.</p>
