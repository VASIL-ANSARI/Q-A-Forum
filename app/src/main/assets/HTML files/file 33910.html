<p>Probably several ways to do this, but this came to my mind first (if I understand correctly what you want):</p>

<pre><code>with d as (
  select 1 as val1, 2 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 2 as val1, 3 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 4 as val1, 5 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 6 as val1, 7 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 8 as val1, 9 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 10 as val1, 11 as val2 from dual
  union all
  select 12 as val1, 13 as val2 from dual
   union all
  select 14 as val1, 15 as val2 from dual
)
select val1 from (
  select val1, ntile(4) over (order by val1 asc) bucket_val1
  from d
)
-- depending or ordering (asc or desc), bucket 1 or 4 will be top or bottom 25%
where bucket_val1 = 4
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>VAL1
12
14
</code></pre>

<p>The above example just looks at one column (val1).  The top or bottom 25% values would depend on your ordering.  More on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e17118/functions115.htm#SQLRF00680" rel="nofollow">ntile</a></p>
