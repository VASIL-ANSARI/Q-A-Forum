<p>Your <code>source</code> callback isn't doing what you think it is. The current contents of the autocompleter are in <code>request.term</code>, not in <code>$("#autocomplete").val()</code>. You're sending an empty value for <code>term</code> back to your PHP and then your SQL looks like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name FROM males WHERE name LIKE '%%' ORDER BY name ASC
</code></pre>

<p>which of courses matches everything in your <code>males</code> table. Your <code>source</code> callback should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>source: function(request, response) { 
    $.ajax({
        url: "http://localhost/testing/auto/search.php",
        data: { term: request.term },
        dataType: "json", 
        type: "POST", 
        success: function(data) { 
            response(data);  
        }
    });
}   
</code></pre>

<p>The jQuery-UI widget probably manipulates the DOM a fair bit so the <code>#autocomplete</code> input element may not have anything useful in it until the autocompleter has a final value for it.</p>

<p>For reference, here's what the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/" rel="nofollow">fine manual</a> has to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The third variation, the callback, provides the most flexibility, and can be used to connect any data source to Autocomplete. The callback gets two arguments:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A <code>request</code> object, with a single property called <code>term</code>, which refers to the value currently in the text input. For example, when the user entered "new yo" in a city field, the Autocomplete term will equal "new yo".</li>
  </ul>
