<p>You want <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestPart.html" rel="nofollow"><code>@RequestPart</code></a> not <code>@RequestParam</code>. Per the documentation ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main difference is that when the method argument is not a String,
  @RequestParam relies on type conversion via a registered Converter or
  PropertyEditor while @RequestPart relies on HttpMessageConverters
  taking into consideration the 'Content-Type' header of the request
  part. @RequestParam is likely to be used with name-value form fields
  while @RequestPart is likely to be used with parts containing more
  complex content (e.g. JSON, XML)</p>
