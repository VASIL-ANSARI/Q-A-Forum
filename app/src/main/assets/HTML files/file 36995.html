<p>The message says that you don't have a clustered index on one of the tables:</p>

<pre><code>"Tables without a clustered index are not 
supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and 
try again."
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlazure/archive/2010/04/29/10004618.aspx" rel="nofollow">SQL Azure requires that every table has a clustered index</a> and tables without the index can not be created in Azure.</p>

<p>So you'll have to check your existing database that all your tables have a clustered index. And for the ones that don't have it, create it. Then try to export to SQL Azure again.</p>

<p>Run this command to add a clustered index to a table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX Table1_Index ON Table1 (Col1)
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this requirement is for data replication. In order to replicate data effectively across different servers, tables must have a proper ordering of data pages in binary-tree structure. And without clustered index (in heap tables) replication becomes a nightmare.
