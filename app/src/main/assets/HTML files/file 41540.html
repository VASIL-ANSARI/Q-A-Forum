<p>you are using <code>assignment operator =</code> to check equality which is wrong.</p>

<p>use <code>equality operator ==</code> to compare e.g.</p>

<pre><code>if (form.size.value = "large")
{
alert ("A large size pizza has been selected.")
}
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>if (form.size.value == "large")
{
alert ("A large size pizza has been selected.")
}
</code></pre>
