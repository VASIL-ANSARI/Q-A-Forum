<p>There is no way to tell a for loop to not advance the iterator, so instead you will either need to use a while loop and manually increase <code>i</code>, or perform any additional looping within the body of your for loop.  Here is how I would write this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in a:
    while not someCondition:
        # do something
    print(i)
</code></pre>
