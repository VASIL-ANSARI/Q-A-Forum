<p>Since I wanted to get pptx thumbnail, I came up with the following solution:<br/>
1. I extracted the thumbnail using DotNetZip<br/>
2. I got the thumbnail which is located in docProps directory<br/>
3. I extracted the thumbnail to <code>memoryStream</code><br/>
4. I converted the <code>memoryStream</code> to <code>BitmapImage</code> and returned it.</p>

<p>here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>public static BitmapImage GetPPTXThumbnail(string filePath)
{
    using (ZipFile zip = ZipFile.Read(filePath))
    {
        ZipEntry e = zip["docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"];

        BitmapImage bImg = new BitmapImage();
        MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
        bImg.BeginInit();
        e.Extract(memoryStream);
        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        bImg.StreamSource = memoryStream;
        bImg.EndInit();

        return bImg;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Cant fail with this solution, this solution is only to get PPTX Thumbnail, I assume it works with all office xml files such as docx, xlsx, etc...</p>
