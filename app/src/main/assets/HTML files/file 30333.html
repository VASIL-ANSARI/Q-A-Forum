<p>Thats pretty simple. You can keep your page exactly how it is.
Theres no need to change your HTML or CSS at all.</p>

<p>All you need to do is add a little bit to the HTML to load the GWT (which is invisible and wont effect anything else). 
Then you need to do is give ID's to any element you want GWT to be able to interact with.
Then, within the Java code, you can either replace these elements or change them as you wish.</p>

<p>For example;</p>

<pre><code>Element MyDiv = DOM.getElementById("left-content")
</code></pre>

<p>Would get this Div in your html;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Div ID="left-content"&gt;Content!&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could then edit that content, apply or remove styles etc.</p>

<p>You can also use the RootPanel,
If you want to add something new into the Div;</p>

<pre><code>Label testlabel = new Label("Test....");
RootPanel.get("left-content").add(testlabel);
</code></pre>

<p>Or just add something to the page at a certain position (floating)</p>

<pre><code>Image testimage= new Image ("testimage.png");
RootPanel.get().add(testimage);
</code></pre>

<p>None of these would effect whats on the page already if you dont want them too.
Likewise, you can add and remove existing styles controlled from your existing css.</p>

<p>In other words; You <em>can</em> let GWT generate HTML and Styles, but you certainly dont have too.</p>
