<p>You are checking the <code>isCancelled()</code> method after you perform the download, so there's no reason it would get cancelled in the middle.</p>

<p>Usually you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!isCancelled()) {
 // Download next buffer..
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the loop will stop once a cancel request has been made.</p>
