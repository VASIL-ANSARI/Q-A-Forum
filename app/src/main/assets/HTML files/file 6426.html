<p>Maybe you need to tell the shell it should be interactive:</p>

<pre><code>system("/bin/sh -i");
</code></pre>

<p>However, I believe that your original <code>system()</code> call should have produced a shell prompt too.</p>

<p>Both notations (with and without the '-i') in this program give me a shell prompt (return to the previous shell by typing 'exit' and <kbd>RETURN</kbd> or <kbd>Control-D</kbd>):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
    system("/bin/sh -i");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
