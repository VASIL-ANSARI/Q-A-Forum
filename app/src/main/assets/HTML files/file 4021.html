<p>The following functions are identical:</p>

<pre><code>int g(double (*pf)())
{
    cout &lt;&lt; (*pf)() &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}

int g2(double pf())
{
    cout &lt;&lt; pf() &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Dereferencing a function pointer (as shown in g) is the same as calling that function's name.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q2> It seems that C++ doesn't make
  difference between *pf and pf. Is that
  correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a difference between *pf and pf (as variables).  If pf is a function, *pf and pf() are identical (Note the parentheses).</p>
