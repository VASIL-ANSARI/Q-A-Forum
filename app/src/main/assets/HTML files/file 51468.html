<p><code>i</code> is a number between 0 and 25 (inclusive), <code>encryption</code> is an array of unknown length (length of input, but we don't know input), so <code>encryption[i]</code> is inherently wrong.</p>

<p>Did you mean <code>encryption[j] = result;</code>?</p>

<p>Notice that second set of loops reverse the meaning of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>!!!<br>
Bad style. Very confusing. Even to you, apparently.</p>
