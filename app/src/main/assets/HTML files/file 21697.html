<p>It's entirely a matter of preference.  It's basically another version of asking when to do an AJAX request rather than a full request.  You could use Backbone entirely for routing with a single page app and then just have the back-end represent a pure representation of the model through an API.  This would be particularly helpful if pursuing an HTML5 -> Mobile type of solution.  I'd recommend a more tempered approach to start with depending on the skill set of you and your colleagues.</p>

<p>The best first step would normally be to make sure to use something like a Backbone router to represent addressable front end state changes that are aligned with the primary application purpose. If the front end is doing things like displaying a detail view which is created from an AJAX request, then rather than implement that through an event handler attached to some UI element, you should implement it using a hash segment and front end routing which the UI element links to.  So for instance the UI element would just be a link to something like <code>/#/item/45</code> and then the router would pick that up and run the handler attached to the pattern like <code>/#/item/{itemId}</code>.  This better represents the state and opens the door to leveraging browser history and creating links that use the existing front end code in a clean way.  </p>

<p>After starting with this you can implement routers increasingly as desired.</p>
