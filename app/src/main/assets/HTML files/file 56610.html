<p>In MySQL, you can express this as:</p>

<pre><code>order by (counter &gt; 1) desc, display_value
</code></pre>

<p>In a numeric context, a boolean is treated as an integer with true as 1 and false as 0.  So <code>(count &gt; 1) desc</code> puts the true values first.  These are then sorted by the <code>display_value</code>.</p>
