<p>Instead of using a Python file for your config, why not use a format more suitable for these kind of work.  One such candidate is JSON, and you could do something like this (as a variation on what the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/setup/" rel="nofollow">Step 2 of the official tutorial suggests</a>):</p>

<pre><code>import json

with open('../config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

app.config.update(config)
</code></pre>

<p>And instead of the <code>config.py</code> file you would have a <code>config.json</code> file (at the same location) that might look like</p>

<pre><code>{
    "DEBUG": true,
    "SECRET_KEY": "development key"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you don't have to use <code>json</code>, there are other configuration file formats out there ready for you to use, but it's up to you to look up on how to use that.</p>
