  <p>The Java client library</p>
  
  <p>RabbitMQ speaks AMQP, which is an open, general-purpose protocol for
  messaging. There are a number of clients for AMQP in many different
  languages. We'll use the Java client provided by RabbitMQ.</p>
  
  <p>Download the client library package, and check its signature as
  described. Unzip it into your working directory and grab the JAR files
  from the unzipped directory:</p>
  
  <p>$ unzip rabbitmq-java-client-bin-<em>.zip $ cp
  rabbitmq-java-client-bin-</em>/*.jar ./ (The RabbitMQ Java client is also
  in the central Maven repository, with the groupId com.rabbitmq and the
  artifactId amqp-client.)</p>
