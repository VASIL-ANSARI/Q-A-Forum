<p>Unfortunately you can't. Not because of some JAXB shortcoming but XML attributes cannot have multiple values by definition.  And XML is very strict regarding its rules.</p>

<p>The best workaround is to redefine the attribute as element. Otherwise when you need to read the attribute, you'll need to parse it and break the value to multiple tokens but I wouldn't recommend this as it is awkward and brittle.</p>
