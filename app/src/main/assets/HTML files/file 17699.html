<p>No boxing for structs, potential for direct call for all types (instead of virtual call).</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{
  public int v;
  public override bool Equals(Object other) {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't provide explicit method that takes MyStruct than MyStruct will have to be boxed for every calls to <code>myFirst.Equals(myOther)</code>. If you do provide <code>Equals(MyStruct other)</code> than compiler will pick that method instead more generic <code>Equals(Object)</code> thus avoiding boxing for the struct.</p>

<p>For all types you can provide much simple implementation of <code>Equals(MyType)</code> as you already know the type. Also compiler/JIT may be able to optimize call better if method is not virtual because more specific version does not need to be virtual.</p>
