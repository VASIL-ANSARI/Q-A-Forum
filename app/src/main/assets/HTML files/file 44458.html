<p>If it is an AJAX call, the user is not supposed to be navigating. It is very likely that the offending code is in the view, possibly a form that is POSTing to the URL instead of performing an AJAX call?</p>

<p>EDIT: Now that you've shown the View code, my suspicions are confirmed. You should not use a regular form, since that will make the user navigate when POSTing the values. An alternative to this is using AjaxForms instead of regular forms. Another one is preventing the form from submitting and rather submitting the values yourself through JavaScript.</p>

<p>I'd actually advice on that last one: using JavaScript to submit, but keeping the form. As such, if someone in your target audience could have JavaScript disabled, you could design around that by using the regular POSTs and user navigations. If they do, you can avoid the navigation by returning false on the submit event of the form.</p>
