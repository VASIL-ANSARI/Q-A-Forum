<p>The Elasticsearch model of data prefers non-normalized data, usually. Depending on the use case (large amount of data, underpowered machines, too few nodes etc) keeping relationships in ES (parent-child) to mimic the inner joins and the like from the RDB world is expensive.</p>

<p>Your question is very open-ended and the answer depends on the use-case. Generally speaking:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid mimicking the exact DB Tables - ES indices plus their relationships</li>
<li>advantage of keeping everything in ES is that you don't need to update both mechanisms at the same time</li>
<li>if your search-able data is very small compared to the overall amount of data, I don't see why you couldn't synchronize just the search-able data with ES</li>
<li>try to flatten the data in ES and resist any impulse of using parent/child just because this is how it's done in MySQL</li>
<li>I'm not saying you cannot use parent/child. You can, but make sure you test this before adopting this approach and make sure you are ok with the response times. This is, anyway, a valid advice for any kind of approach you choose.</li>
</ul>
