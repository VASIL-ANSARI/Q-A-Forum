<p>Building a Big site with Sinatra will not face you with scaling problems, but will definitely give u a very hard time maintaining code. Although i love Sinatra, convention over configuration in rails wins hands down. Also note that it isnt wrong/bad/impossible to use Sinatra for a huge site, just that it is hard doing it right and you would not want yourself regretting later. If you still are stubborn in using Sinatra you can try <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/" rel="nofollow">Padrino</a> which is basically a wrapper over Sinatra(I have never used it so cant help you about that)</p>
