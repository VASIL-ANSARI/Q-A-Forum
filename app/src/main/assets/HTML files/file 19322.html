<p>When an exception is thrown in the constructor all fully constructed subobjects are destroyed. Since it is good practice to have destructors of constructed objects look after their resoyrces, nothing needs to be done for these subobjects. What remains is cleaning up in the body of the constructor currently executing when the exception is thrown. However, this is no different to the clean-up in any other function.</p>

<p>Note that the destruction order is the reverse of the construction. That is, clean-up in the body starts first when all subobjects are not, yet, destroyed. Then the members are destroyed, then non-virtual base classes, and finally virtual base classes.</p>
