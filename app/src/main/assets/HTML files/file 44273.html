<p>I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect that PostgreSQL believes that it is going to be be faster to read the table than the index, because of the random_page_cost. The index read is potentially higher cost because of the need to find essentially random pages in it.</p>

<p>The data retrieved from the table is going to need sorting, but the calculations probably suggest that the total cost of (sequential table read + sort) is greater than (random index reads).</p>

<p>This is partially testable by changing the value of random_page_cost, which would be worth investigating if you're using very fast disks or an SSD anyway.</p>
