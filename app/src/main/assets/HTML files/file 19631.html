<p>Strip errors are generally caused if you have duplicate debugging symbols in your project. Just try the following:</p>

<p><strong>First Method:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to build settings of your project</li>
<li>Type <code>Strip</code> in the search Bar.</li>
<li>Under <code>Strip Debug Symbols During Copy</code>, you shall find <code>Debug</code> and under that you shall find <code>Any SDK</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>NO</code> in <code>Any SDK</code>, select <code>YES</code> in <code>Debug</code> and select <code>YES</code> in <code>Strip Debug Symbols during copy</code>.</li>
<li>A little below you shall find <code>Use Separate Strip</code>. Select YES<code>.</code></li>
<li>Check that <code>Strip Style</code> should remain <code>All Symbols</code> [If not then change it to that].</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Second Method:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since your error also mentions derived data, their might me duplicacy of your derived data as well. Delete Your project file from the derived data folder.
  If you don't know where the derived data folder is, Google it.</p>

<p>I am using aviary in my current project. I have a Mac Mini and a MacAir [for work at home].
I was facing the same strip issues with aviary which I resolved using the first method mentioned above.</p>

<p>It took me a week to figure this out cuz i am a relative newbie in development and nothing regarding this issue has been mentioned in aviary forums as well.</p>

<p>PS: </p>

<pre><code>MacMini: Xcode 4.5
MacAir: Xcode 4.2
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
