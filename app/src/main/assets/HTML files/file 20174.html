<p>Unfortunately, I don't think you're going to be able to set up foreign key references to a table on a different database. If you look at the generator files, we see this line:</p>

<p>In <code>propel/generator/lib/model/Table.php</code>, line 901 in the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel/blob/master/generator/lib/model/Table.php" rel="nofollow">current github version</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public function setupReferrers($throwErrors = false)
{
  foreach ($this-&gt;getForeignKeys() as $foreignKey) {

    // table referrers
    $foreignTable = $this-&gt;getDatabase()-&gt;getTable($foreignKey-&gt;getForeignTableName());
    if ($foreignTable !== null) {
      ...
    } elseif ($throwErrors) {
      throw new BuildException(sprintf(
        'Table "%s" contains a foreign key to nonexistent table "%s"',
        $this-&gt;getName(),
        $foreignKey-&gt;getForeignTableName()
      ));
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key line is where it says <code>$foreignTable = $this-&gt;getDatabase()...</code> in other words, it will only work on references to that table's own database. I would recommend adding your voice to <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel/issues/191" rel="nofollow">this github issue</a> which seems to be what you're asking for.</p>
