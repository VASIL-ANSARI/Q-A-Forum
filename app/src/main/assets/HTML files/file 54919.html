<p>this thread is quite old, but I hope my answer can still be useful to you.</p>

<p>The expect methods are of pexpect, not of pyserial.</p>

<p>You should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>temp = pexpect.fdpexpect.fdswpan(ser)
temp.expect("message")
</code></pre>

<p>basically, from temp onwards you should call methods on the temp object, not on the serial object. This includes the sendline() call, later on.</p>
