<p>So you want to resume your download.</p>

<p>If you get an IOException on reading from the URL, there was a problem with the connection.
This happens. Now you must note how much you already did download, and open a new connection which starts from there.</p>

<p>To do this, use <code>setRequestProperty()</code> on the second, and send the right header fields for "I want only the range of the resource starting with ...". See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35.2" rel="nofollow">section 14.35.2 Range Retrieval Requests</a> in the HTTP 1.1 specification. You should check the header fields on the response to see if you really got back a range, though.</p>
