<p>You cannot have an abstract destructor. You need to define it in <code>stack_error</code>. (see the correction below)</p>

<p>Did you mean to make in <em>virtual</em>?</p>

<p>Unlike other virtual functions, virtual destructors are not overriding each other. The destructors of all the base classes will be executed sequentially (starting from the most derived class destructor). Each class musty have a destructor; even if you don't define a destructor, it's created implicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong><br>
You can make the destructor abstract, but need to define its body anyway. Like that:</p>

<pre><code>virtual ~stack_error() = 0 {};
</code></pre>

<p>if this your compiler the latest C++0x features. Otherwise you have to define the body outside:</p>

<pre><code>class stack_error
{
    ...
    virtual ~stack_error() = 0;
    ...
};
stack_error::~stack_error() {}
</code></pre>

<p>Abstract (<code>=0</code>) means that it needs to be defines in the derived classes; nevertheless you have to define the destructor's body.</p>
