<p>Does the dialog box appear multiple times if you just run that code by itself?</p>

<p>If the dialog box is appearing multiple times, one likely explanation is that you are accidentally running this <code>.live()</code> binding more than once. If that happened, you would see one dialog box for each time you bound an event to the button.</p>

<p>Make sure you are only attaching this function to the button once.</p>

<p>If you take a look at this <a href="http://jsbin.com/omoni/" rel="nofollow">standalone example</a>, you can see that your code is fine.</p>
