<p>You want to use <code>get</code>, but you want the fragment feature of <code>load</code>, so you'll have to do that work yourself. Then remember what you got last time, and only update if it's not the same:</p>

<pre><code>var lastHTML;

function startTime()
{
    var $main = $('#div1');
    $.get('chat.php', function (data) // &lt;== Or index.php, the question has both
    {
        var elements, html;

        // Turn the HTML into elements
        elements = $(data);

        // Get the HTML of *only* the contents of #div1
        html = elements.find("#div1").html();

        // If that has changed, use it
        if (lastHTML !== thisHTML) {
            lastHTML = thisHTML;
            $main.html(thisHTML);
        }
    }); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that that's a fairly basic implementation of the fragment feature (it doesn't, for instance, strip out scripts the way <code>load</code> does). You may want to look at how <code>load</code> does its fragment stuff and replicate that (the joy of open source).</p>
