<p>What we do for this sort of configuration is maintain a directory of configuration fragments, which can be added/removed as necessary, and then doing something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>cat .ssh/config.d/* &gt; .ssh/config
</code></pre>

<p>This will append things in lexical order, which means the ordering depends on how you elect to name your files.  This makes it very easy to expire old configurations, remove specific items, and otherwise control the config file.</p>
