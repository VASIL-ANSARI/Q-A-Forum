<p>It's because you're overwriting a literal string in the <code>sscanf</code> call. <code>d-&gt;name</code> points to a literal string, and those are read-only and of a fixed length (so if the string you try to get is longer than 7 character you also try to write beyond the end).</p>

<p>You need to either use an array for <code>d-&gt;name</code> or allocate memory on the heap for it.</p>
