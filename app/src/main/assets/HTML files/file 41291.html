<p>If you store your workflow XAML in the database or a file, you can load it at runtime without rebuilding the project and deploying.</p>

<p>Here is an example of dynamically executing a workflow loaded at runtime from an XML file:</p>

<pre><code>var activity = ActivityXamlServices.Load("SavedWorkflow.xml");

WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(activity);
</code></pre>

<p>As you see from the example the Load method above returns an <code>Activity</code> object that you can modify (e.g. change the conditions) prior to executing the workflow.</p>
