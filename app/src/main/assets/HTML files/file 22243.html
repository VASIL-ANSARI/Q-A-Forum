<p>You must have a license key in order to use this service, as written <a href="http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/web-services" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of the services take the same parameters as inputs. The only difference between them is the URI they use and the data they return. The two parameters that each service takes are the IP address to look up <strong>and <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key" rel="nofollow">your MaxMind license key</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you get such a key, you have to add it to the URL in addition to the IP address.</p>
