<p>I noticed the same bug in my app on two devices. All with custom roms (CM based).
Try to use this library <a href="https://github.com/klinker41/android-smsmms" rel="nofollow">android smsmms sending library</a> and if the issue persists, it may mean that there is something wrong with your manifest file.</p>
