<p>In your MONGODB_SETTINGS dictionary, the key for the database name should be 'db', not 'DB' (i.e. all lowercase).</p>

<p>The error you're getting is because the MongoEngine extension cannot find the 'db' entry in your configuration, and so uses 'default' as the database name.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Upon further inspection, it seems this is a bug somewhere in (Flask-)MongoEngine (or possible pymongo) where the default value of read_preference in mongoengine.connect is False instead of an actual read preference, and is not transformed to the actual default in pymongo</p>

<p>If you add</p>

<pre><code>from pymongo import read_preferences
</code></pre>

<p>to your imports and</p>

<pre><code>'read_preference': read_preferences.ReadPreference.PRIMARY
</code></pre>

<p>to your config dictionary, it should work (that's the default read_preference in pymongo)</p>
