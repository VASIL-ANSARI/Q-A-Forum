<p>Your problem was simply that when you <strong>first</strong> coded the app, you were programmatically creating your <code>CompassView</code> with this:</p>

<pre><code>    compassView = new CompassView(this);
    setContentView(compassView);
</code></pre>

<p>When you changed to use XML layouts, that first line was <em>presumably</em> removed.  But, you still need to assign your <code>compassView</code> member variable, because you use it in your <code>SensorEventListener</code>'s <code>onSensorChanged()</code> method.  You were getting a <code>NullPointerException</code> (which you can see by looking at <strong>LogCat</strong>).</p>

<p>So, in your <code>onCreate()</code> method, after setting the content view, remember to do this:</p>

<pre><code>setContentView(R.layout.activity_display_compass);
compassView = (CompassView)findViewById(R.id.compassView);  // &lt;- missing?!
</code></pre>
