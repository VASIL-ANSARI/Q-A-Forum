<p>This error appears due to an attempt to set the <code>SelectedItem</code> property of the <code>LongListSelector</code>, <BR> to a value that is not a current member of the data-binded model of <code>ItemsSource</code> property.  </p>

<p>The setting of the property can occur by user selection, by a trigger or by event.</p>

<p>In your case, you are setting design time data, using <code>d:DataContext</code>, to <code>PeopleViewModel.People</code>, <BR> 
You need to find out who is setting <code>SelectedItem</code> to invalid value.</p>
