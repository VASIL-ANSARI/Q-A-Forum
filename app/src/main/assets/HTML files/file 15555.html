<p>Please elaborate on your question as it does not signify it's purpose..I think you are asking the deifference between connecting the datasource and delegates via xib and declaring it programmatically via a class.There is not much of a difference between them but logically if you see IBAction and IBOutlet are just the identifiers to let the compiler know that the object has been defined via interface builder(now integrated with xcode in later versions of xCode).IBAction is defined to void while IBOutlet is just defined.Apple's definition is as:-</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef IBOutlet
#define IBOutlet 
#endif  

#ifndef 
IBAction #define 
IBAction void 
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Both act as identifiers for compiler that's all.It just tells the compiler that certain methods are defined via interface builder.</p>
