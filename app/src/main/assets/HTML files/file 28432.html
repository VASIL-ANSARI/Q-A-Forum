<p>There is no problem with switching to SublimeText2/3 in almost any language. </p>

<ul>
<li>There are multiple <code>git</code> packages that help you with using it, such as full integration, merges and everything else you may need. </li>
<li>Even if you would build or simply needed to restart the tomcat server you can write your own build system that will run everything you need just like you would manually do in terminal.</li>
<li>SublimeText works exceptionally well with JS and it's frameworks as well as code-in-code - different languages one in another.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nlloyd/SublimeMaven" rel="nofollow">Maven package</a> is available</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to the parts that you would probably miss when switching from other IDE's.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IntelliSense - SublimeText has a package named CodeIntel that will help with that, but it's not working that good in comparison to other IDEs.</p></li>
<li><p>MySQL - SublimeText has no way to integrate DB management.</p></li>
</ul>
