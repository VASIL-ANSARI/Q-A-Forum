<p>This is not so much a JDBC issue as a database issue. Databases do not allow you to prepare DDL, since there is not much potential for reuse. Most of the time, the reason you would want to prepare a statement is if there is reuse potential. DDL is mostly for one-off use, to set up the schema for an application. (Note my use of "most of the time" and "mostly" to indicate the most common use case.) </p>

<p>Also, in general, if you construct a SQL or DDL statement using string concatenation, you are opening yourself not just only to SQL injection, but other problems like syntax errors, escaping of characters, and so on. So, better practice is to have your DDL outside of your main application logic. Is this possible in your case?</p>
