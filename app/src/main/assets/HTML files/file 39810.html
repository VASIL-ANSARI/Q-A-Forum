<p>Not with GLES20; you should use LINES and specify which ones you want to draw:</p>

<pre><code>private final short[] mIndices = new short[] {
        0,1,1,2, //triangle 1
        2,3,3,0, // triangle 2

        // Upper rectangle
        4,5,5,6, //triangle 3
        6,7,7,4, // triangle 4
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you had GLES30 you could use primitive restart to start a new loop between the rectangles.</p>
