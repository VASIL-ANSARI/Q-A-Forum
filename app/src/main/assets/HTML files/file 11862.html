<p>Don't override back button behavior. If user presses back, he want to go to previous page. If you have another back button in UI then use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.navigation.navigationservice.goback.aspx" rel="nofollow">NavigationService.GoBack</a> instead of going to concrete page.</p>

<p>If your app really can't work this way and you cannot change this, as a last resort you can remove last entry from navigation history (so back will not go to this entry) using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.navigation.navigationservice.removebackentry%28v=VS.92%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry</a> (this is new in Mango).</p>
