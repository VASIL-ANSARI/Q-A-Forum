<p>Well, you could store those messages as another entry in <code>sms_inbox</code> table, but it would be helpful to store a timestamp as well to be able to distinguish each message.</p>

<p>When you query you could pass the phone number as what is the phone number you're interested into: <code>SELECT * from sms_inbox where 'SENDER_NUMBER' = '?'</code></p>

<p>Or you could make a select ordered by SENDER_NUMBER: <code>SELECT * from sms_inbox order by 'SENDER_NUMBER' desc;</code></p>

<p>In the end it all depends on the use-cases you have. You could also use another table for keeping only the messages for a number and map a one-to-many relationship.</p>
