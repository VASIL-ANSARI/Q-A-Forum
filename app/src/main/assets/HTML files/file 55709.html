<p>I have figured out a work around to the problem that I had. It is not the cleanest in the world, but as far as my knowledge it is the only way to do what I am trying to do in this instance.</p>

<p>1) I created a way to trigger a javascript function that would retrieve the information in the divs in the correct order</p>

<p>2) I stored all the ordered information of the divs in a variable that I then attached to an asp:HiddenField element to later be retrieved in the code behind</p>

<p>3) at the end of the javascript function I trigger a click on a asp:LinkButton element that would trigger a code behind event handler. In this event handler I then retrieved the ordered information from the HiddenField and used it as needed.</p>

<p>Hope this helps anyone who was having the same problems as myself. As I said, maybe not the cleanest or simplest way to do it, but it is the only way I could find after hours and hours of searching, and, if done right, it could be somewhat clean.</p>
