<p>Use <code>EXISTS</code> to return a person if another person has same surname and DOB but a different phone number (or other unique data).</p>

<pre><code>select *
from personal_details pd1
where pd1.surname = 'Jones'
  and exists (select 1 from personal_details pd2
              where pd2.surname = pd1.surname
                and pd2.DOB = pd1.DOB
                and pd2.phone &lt;&gt; pd1.phone)
</code></pre>
