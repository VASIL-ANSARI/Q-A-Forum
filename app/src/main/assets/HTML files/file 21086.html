<p>Yeah, I think the problem is here:</p>

<p><code>
[NSString stringWithFormat:@"insert into images (photo) values ('%@')", imageData]]; // i use class SQLiteaccess
</code></p>

<p>When using SQLite directly, you should set the binary data by <code>sqlite3_bind_blob()</code>, but you're actually setting the binary data as string.</p>

<p>So when you get back the data, it's not a binary data, it's a <code>String</code> object, of course, an string object don't response to <code>-[NSData bytes]</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile I think you should check the field type in your SQLite DB file. Does the <code>photo</code> is actually set to <code>blob</code>.</p>
