<p>It appears that <code>food_table</code> contains the fields:<br/></p>

<p><code>food_id</code> : unique id assigned to a food item<br/>
<code>food_name</code> : name of the food item<br/>
<code>food_raw</code> : ingredients separated by <code>,</code></p>

<p>Now, since it is possible that the ingredients be the <em>same</em>, but its order be <strong>different</strong> from that stored in the database, a simple <code>WHERE LIKE %"a, b, c"%</code> won't work as <code>b, a, c</code> are also valid ingredients for the same food (just the order is different).</p>

<p>Hence, you need to match each <em>individual</em> ingredient instead of all the ingredients as a whole:</p>

<pre><code>String req = "";
for(String rawName : rawNames)
  req += " food_raw LIKE %"+rawName+"% AND";
if(req.length() &gt; 4)
  req = req.substring(0, req.length()-4); // to remove last " AND"
String query = "SELECT * FROM food_table WHERE "+req;
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>query</code> you should be able to obtain the food name, regardless of item order.</p>
