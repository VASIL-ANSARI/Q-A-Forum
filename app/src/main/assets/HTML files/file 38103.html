<p>Ok, there is one very simple solution as to how to get access to the contents of the zip folder. I did not realise that one had to extract the contents of the zip folder using <strong>extractTo();</strong></p>

<p>This means that the contents of the .docx file are extracted to tmp_doc/. From there we can manipulate any .xml files that we need to.</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_FILES['upload'])) {
    $errors = array();
    $zip = new ZipArchive;

    if (end(explode('.', $_FILES["upload"]["name"]))!== 'docx') {
        $errors[] = 'Error: Wrong format';
    }

    if($zip-&gt;open($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name']) === false){
        $errors[] = 'Failed to open file';
    }

    if (empty($errors)) {
        $zip-&gt;extractTo('./uploads/tmp_doc');
        $zip-&gt;close();
    }
}
</code></pre>
