<p>If your line breaks are in HTML-form, you could use something like <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php" rel="nofollow">strip_tags()</a></p>

<p>If they aren't, I suspect an issue with encoding. Maybe an combination of stripslashes, utf8_encode or utf8_decode could solve this wrong counted words.</p>

<p>As an last resort you could use some regular expression to filter anything but [a-zA-Z] and spaces.</p>
