<p>Before redirecting your user, encrypt the querystring parameters one by one and decrypt them one by one on the page you redirect.. You can find tons of encription libraries on the net. You can store these values in session and load the session only if the Page.IsPostBack is false, if it is true, load the parameters back from the Session.</p>
