<p>It seems as though this is a known problem: <a href="http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/show_bug.cgi?id=10874" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/show_bug.cgi?id=10874</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately it has been open for ages with no real feedback / action.</p>

<p>Side note - that error seems to point to a problem with the 'action' parameter. I replaced the URL's I was using with URL's shortened by bit.ly and it seems to be working.</p>
