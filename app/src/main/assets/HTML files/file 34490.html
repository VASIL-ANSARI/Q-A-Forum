<p>I'm not familiar with PIL, but as I can see from docs, you can pass file object as the "file" argument to the "open" function.</p>

<p>Django <code>request.FILES</code> stores UploadedFile objects - simple wrapper around uploaded file (stored in memory or in temporary file), and it supports read, seek, and tell operations, so it could be passed directly to PIL "open" function.</p>
