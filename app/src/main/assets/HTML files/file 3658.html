<p>If you are not worried about optimization, the main 2 criteria for primary key are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Uniqueness</p></li>
<li><p>Constanteness (never changes)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>E.g. if your problem domain is - and will always be - such that 2 product names are always distinct, AND that no product will ever change its name (think Norton Antivirus -> Symantec Antivirus for a simple example of name change), then you may use the product name as the unique key.</p>

<p>The two MUST be 100% true not only today, but for any foreseeable future lifetime of the database. </p>

<p>Therefore using numeric ID is highly recommended as you may not always be able to forecee such things - and changing the DB structure later on to have a product ID is of course orders of magnitude worse than a minor inconvenience of needing to map and ID from the name in your queries.</p>
