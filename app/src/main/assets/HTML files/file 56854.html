<p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean here. What your code does is look for an unspecified method on the jQuery object called <code>effects</code>.</p>

<p>If you mean that you want to store the contents of the attribute 'data-effect' and then apply that to another element later, you can do that like this:</p>

<pre><code>var effects = $('#effect').attr('data-effect');
$(contentsDiv).attr('data-effect', effects);
</code></pre>
