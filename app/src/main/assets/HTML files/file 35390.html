<p>Your problem is your database already has those columns </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" rel="nofollow">Paperclip</a> uses <code>t.attachment</code> to input these columns to your db:</p>

<pre><code>[attachment]_file_name
[attachment]_content_type
[attachment]_file_size
[attachment]_updated_at
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>t.attachment</code> basically means you're trying to create one of these columns, but they already exist. The way to fix this is to just get rid of the contents of that migration, run <code>rake db:migrate</code> again, then delete the file</p>
