<p>My guess is that your form action attribute doesn't have parameters in the URL and the method is <code>post</code>. When you submitted a form you didn't specify any parameters in the URL. In most cases when you doing <code>post</code> request you don't want to use parameters in the URL, so you can use <code>hidden</code> field with the name of the parameter. After the form is submitted you can get the parameter in the same way as any other request parameters. This parameter won't be passed with the URL but in the body of the request, so request methods to retrieve parameters work, and struts can populate this parameter to the action bean if it has a public setter.</p>

<pre class="lang-jsp prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;s:form action="deliverable" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;s:hidden name="id" value="123"/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/s:form&gt; 
</code></pre>
