<p>I don't think you were ever supposed to have nested <code>UINavigationController</code>s, and even if you could before, there's little reason to do so. You can present a <code>UINavigationController</code> as a modal view from another view controller that is already in a <code>UINavigationController</code>, but containing one in another just doesn't make any sense. That's why it's not allowed.</p>

<p>If you wanted to nest one within another, for whatever reason, you could probably find a third party open source <code>UINavigationController</code> replacement that isn't a subclass of <code>UINavigationController</code> itself, but instead uses the view controller containment methods on its own to duplicate the behavior, and then you should be able to nest those. But you have to be sure that it's not a <code>UINavigationController</code> subclass or it'll still restrict you in the same way.</p>

<p>My ultimate suggestion though is to rethink your UI so that you don't have to try nesting <code>UINavigationController</code>s. I can't see a good use case for this.</p>
