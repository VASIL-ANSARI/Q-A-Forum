<p>Just update your structure:</p>

<pre><code>user_id_0 {
    name: Michael
    country: USA
    hobbies
       hobby_id_0
         name: Football
         team: Barcelona
       hobby_id_1
         name: Curling
         team: Ice Slippers
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can get to data via queries or deep queries but you may want to consider denormalizing the data and pull the hobbies out for each user, depending on how many other levels of children is needed.</p>
