<p>The easiest way to connect with Firebase's Real-time Database is through its REST API. In Unity web player, I suggest Unity's <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WWW.html" rel="nofollow">WWW</a> with <strong>X-HTTP-Method-Override</strong> should be able to do the work smoothly.  You could see their documentation on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/" rel="nofollow">https://firebase.google.com/docs/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, I have updated my Firebase REST API wrapper (<a href="http://u3d.as/pGA" rel="nofollow">simple-firebase-unity</a>, which is actually the same as the one you shared) and now it should also work fine on unity web player. Please check it out again :D</p>
