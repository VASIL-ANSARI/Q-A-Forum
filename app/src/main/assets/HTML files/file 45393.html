<p>Your form is submitting - you just haven't submitted any data to it.  Your form's only input is a checkbox which isn't checked.  Per the documentation for <a href="https://api.jquery.com/serialize/" rel="nofollow">.serialize()</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Only "successful controls" are serialized to the string. No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button. For a form element's value to be included in the serialized string, the element must have a name attribute. <strong>Values from checkboxes and radio buttons (inputs of type "radio" or "checkbox") are included only if they are checked.</strong> Data from file select elements is not serialized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Substitute your form with this one and submit it.  You should see:
<br>data someName=This+is+a+test&amp;input1=true</p>
