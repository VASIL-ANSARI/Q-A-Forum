<p>The problem is with the first argument for <code>WritePixels</code>, which indicates the area of the <code>WriteableBitmap</code> to update.  </p>

<p>Instead of <code>Int32Rect.Empty</code>, you can do something like the following and should see the second image written over the first:</p>

<pre><code>Int32Rect sourceRect = new Int32Rect(0, 0, (int)layerTwo.Width, (int)layerTwo.Height);
composite.WritePixels(sourceRect, pixels, stride, 0);
</code></pre>
