  <p>I downloaded NumPy through Anaconda and <strong>copied and pasted the NumPy file from there to the site-package file in the Python 27 folder</strong>.</p>

<p>Don't do this! <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html#windows-install" rel="nofollow">Follow the instructions on the Continuum website</a> and install using the <code>.exe</code> file.</p>

<p>Anaconda is a fully self-contained environment that includes its own installers for Python - you don't need to do anything to your system-wide <code>site-packages</code> directory.</p>
