<p>I believe this is what you're trying to achieve--obviously, this solution is contingent on the join integrity. So you'll have to makes sure the PK match to ensure you're not getting an improper join. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.AField1,
  a.AField2,
  a.AField3,
  bb.BField2,
  bb.BField3
FROM TableA a
WHERE EXISTS
  (SELECT 'X'
  FROM TableB b
  WHERE b.BField3 LIKE 'E11%'
  AND a.AField1 = b.BField1
  )
  (SELECT * FROM TableB WHERE BField3 LIKE 'E11%'
  ) bb
AND a.AField1 = bb.BField1
</code></pre>

<p>In SQL you can alias the tables--read more about it here:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/198196/when-to-use-sql-table-alias">When to use SQL Table Alias</a></p>
