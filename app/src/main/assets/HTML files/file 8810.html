<p>You child process is most likely killed by a segmentation fault:</p>

<pre><code>*myName = "child";
</code></pre>

<p>is invalid as your compiler should have told you (if it didn't warn on that, please turn up the warnings/diagnostics level).</p>

<p>If you wanted to change <code>myName</code>, you'd need to use something like <code>strcpy</code>. But you can't do that on <code>myName</code> because it could point to read-only memory. You should initialize it with dynamic memory like you do for the <code>dyn</code> pointer.</p>

<p>If all you need is that <code>myName</code> points to a different string, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>myName = "child";
</code></pre>
