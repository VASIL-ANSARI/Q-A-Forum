<p>Shouldn't your server return HTTP code 204 (No Content), instead of 200? Except for a HEAD request that is. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" rel="nofollow">Http Status Code definition</a></p>

<p>Apart from that, you could indeed just check to work around what looks like a not-all-too-compliant server implementation, or catch the exception and then determine the proper action depending on the type of request you sent.</p>
