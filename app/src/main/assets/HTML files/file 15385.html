<p>This is something handled by using the publish - subscribe pattern. You may want to look into a plug 'n play service such as <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/" rel="nofollow">pubnub</a>. That will let you do just that. Phones that should be receiving each other's messages will have listeners set up on the same pubnub channel, and will receive a notification when any of the other phones publish to that channel. Something like pubnub has a pretty simple API/SDK that you can use to get a prototype up and running pretty quickly (and for free, at least at first).</p>
