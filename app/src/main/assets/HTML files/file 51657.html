<p>This can be done by merging all your Bitmap on a canvas, that will make one Bitmap as a combination of all bitmap. once canvas is ready just connect it to ImageView.</p>

<p>Bitmap drawnBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(1280, 720, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
Canvas canvas = new Canvas(drawnBitmap);</p>

<p>canvas.drawBitmap(, null, , new Paint());</p>

<p>mapImageView.setImageBitmap(drawnBitmap);</p>
