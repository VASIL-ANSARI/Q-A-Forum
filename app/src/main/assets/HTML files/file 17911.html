<p>This doesn't exactly answer your question regarding WCF and transferring files, however I built an auto-updater application not too long ago that had a small client front-end to a WinForms app.  It would get a list of local files, generate an MD5 hash of each one and send it up to a web service for comparison against a local list of files on the web server.  The web service method returned the list of files that changed.</p>

<p>The client would then loop through that list and call another web service that would return a byte array for each file and dump it out to the local hard drive.</p>

<p>When this was done, it would do a Process.Start on the exe of the updated app.  </p>

<p>It's been running in production with a couple hundred active users for over a year with no issues.</p>
