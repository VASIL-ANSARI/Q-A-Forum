<p>You can/should use foreach to iterate over every element of an array.</p>

<pre><code>$foo = new stdClass;
$foo-&gt;arr = array('1','7','heaven','eleven');

foreach ($foo-&gt;arr as $val)
{
    if (is_object($val)) var_dump($val);
    else echo $val;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note the line I added to var_dump sub-objects. The error you were initially getting was that the elements of your sets array were also objects, not strings as expected. If you only need to access certain elements of the set objects, you can access them using $val->property.</p>
