<p>I have the same problem with a responsive grid.
Check this image, the grid is okay on the left and broken on the right.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tfmgZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Grid is broken because specific height for image is needed and the responsive process pass the height value into "auto".</p>

<p>So here we have to relayout when images are loaded (giving specific height to process).</p>

<p>For now the solution I find is to relayout on scrool:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).scroll(function() {
        $container.isotope('reLayout');
});
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm sure there is a better way to do this.</p>

<p>And try freetile for the grid, found it great and lighter than others.
