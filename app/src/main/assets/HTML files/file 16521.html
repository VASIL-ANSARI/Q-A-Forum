<p>I found solution,</p>

<p>My ajax function is like that: <code>$.post('Giris/GirisGecerliMi', kullanici, girisAjaxReturn);</code></p>

<p>when adress bar is <code>http://localhost:12799</code> it works with true url. But after adress bar writes as <code>http://localhost:12799/Giris/Index?ReturnUrl=%2fAnasayfa%2fIndex</code> ajax tries to go a wrong url.</p>

<p>After some search, I saw my mistake, I should have written as: <code>$.post('/Giris/GirisGecerliMi', kullanici, girisAjaxReturn);</code> only a "/" difference solved the problem. Sorry for taking your time.</p>
