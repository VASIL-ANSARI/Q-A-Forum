<p>You can put your variables and functions you want inside a module which means that it doesn't have to be instantiated.  </p>

<pre><code>module constants {
   export var myValue = 'foo';

   export function thisIsAStaticLikeFunction () {
      console.log('function called');
   }
}

.....
console.log(constants.myValue);
</code></pre>

<p>There really is no such thing as a true static class, but this comes pretty close to replicating it. </p>
