<h2>-440</h2>

<p>NO AUTHORIZED routine-type BY THE NAME routine-name HAVING COMPATIBLE ARGUMENTS WAS FOUND IN THE CURRENT PATH</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>An attempt was made to invoke a routine, but DB2Â® could not resolve the invocation of a routine, including the argument list, to a specific routine definition.</p>

<p><em>routine-type</em></p>

<p>The type of routine, such as FUNCTION or PROCEDURE.</p>

<p><em>routine-name or schema-name.routine-name</em></p>

<p>The name of the routine. If the originating statement references a qualified name, the routine name in the message text is qualified by the name of the schema. </p>

<p><strong>Possible causes for this error include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The routine name was either incorrectly specified or does not exist in the database.</li>
<li>A qualified reference was used, and the schema qualifier was incorrectly specified.</li>
<li>The user's SQL path does not contain the schema to which the desired function belongs, and an unqualified reference was used.</li>
<li>The wrong number of arguments was included.</li>
<li>The right number of arguments was included in the routine reference, but the data type of one or more of the arguments is incorrect.</li>
<li>The invoker of the routine is not authorized to execute the routine.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Response</strong></p>
