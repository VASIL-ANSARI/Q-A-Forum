<p>Building up complex joins like that is not recommended unless you have good reasons like performance. It's much simpler to use repositories to compose relations by defining relation views that you need for reusability and composing those in various way inside repos. Defining custom mappers should also be avoided unless you have some unique requirements.</p>

<p>We're working on a new set of docs that will properly explain those things.</p>
