<p>According to Kalen Delaney, in her book <em>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine</em>, SQL Server 2005 (and now 2008) can update a row by either using an insert/delete or in place, by just changing one column's value.  Here's a quick summary of what she says on p. 306-311 of the book. </p>

<p>The normal behavior in SQL Server 2005/2008 is to update a row in place.  The row stays in the same location on the page and only the affected bytes are changed. An example of this would be updating the value in an integer column that's not part of the culstered index.</p>

<p>A row may updated with an insert/delete when it's size changes and it no longer fits on the original page. This could happen when you change the value in a varchar column and make it longer. It also happens when the clustered index column is changing and the row needs to move because of its position in the index (because rows are ordered by the clustered key). An example of this would be changing someone's last name from "Smith" to "Jones" in a table with a clustered index on last name. </p>
