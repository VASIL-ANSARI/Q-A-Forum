<p>The countdown latch allows you to wait on the latch until it's current count is reduced to zero. THis means you can have a thread wait until a certain amount of work is completed by other threads, each one counting down when they are done doing whatever it is.</p>

<p>The semaphore allows you to allocate permits to tasks. You might only want 10 permits to be available, so the 11th task asking for a permit has to wait until another task returns one back. </p>

<p>So you could, for example, have a semaphore with only 1 permit available, and locking on that. This will result in the same behaviour as synchronizing the method/block. Once the permit is returnded, another thread can obtain it in order to enter the locked block.</p>

<pre><code> sem.acquire();

 doSomeStuff();

 sem.release();
</code></pre>

<p>if the semaphore is initialised with only 1 permit, then it's the same as:</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(someLock) {

  doSomeStuff();

}
</code></pre>
