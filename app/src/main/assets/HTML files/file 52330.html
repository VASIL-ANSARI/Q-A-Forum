<p>Constructor overloading resolution behaves the same as method overloading resolution. When two constructors match the passed parameter, the one with the more specific argument types is chosen.</p>

<p><code>null</code> can be assigned to both a <code>double[]</code> and an <code>Object</code>, since both are reference types, but an array is a more specific type than <code>Object</code> (since arrays are sub-classes of the <code>Object</code> class), so <code>new TestApplication(null)</code> triggers the <code>TestApplication(double[] darray)</code> constructor.</p>
