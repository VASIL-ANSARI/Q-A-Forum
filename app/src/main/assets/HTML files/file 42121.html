<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As @Shim commented right, my answer just explains the reason for the error output, but does not tell the things <strong>I already said in my comment on your question</strong>:</p>

<p>It is not allowed to push a <code>UINavigationController</code> on an existing navigation stack. Therefore you should remove the second navigation controller and just add a <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> to the <code>navigationItem</code> of your <code>subDuaList</code> view controller.</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason for your error is, that the <code>segue.destinationViewController</code> is the second <code>UINavigationController</code> and not the <code>subDuaList</code> view controller. </p>

<p><strong>If it was allowed, you could have repaired your code as follows</strong> by replacing:</p>

<pre><code>var subDua:subDuaList = segue.destinationViewController as subDuaList //ERROR OCCURS HERE 
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>var navCtrl:UINavigationController = segue.destinationViewController as UINavigationController 
var subDua:subDuaList = navCtrl.childViewControllers[0] as subDuaList
</code></pre>
