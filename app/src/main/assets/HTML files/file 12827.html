<p>It seems like when printed from IE and <code>size</code> attribute is applied to <code>select</code>, the browser sets a fixed height and does not apply the overflow. I don't have the chance to test on IE as I am using Ubuntu, but can you please try to add a <code>style="overflow: hidden;"</code> to your <code>select</code> element? If it does not work and removing the <code>size</code> attribute is an option, try that as well.</p>
