<p>From the official ServerApplication documentation:</p>

<p>New threads must only be created in initialize() or main() or methods called from there, but not in the application class' constructor or in the constructor of instance variables. The reason for this is that fork() will be called in order to create the daemon process, and threads created prior to calling fork() won't be taken over to the daemon process. </p>
