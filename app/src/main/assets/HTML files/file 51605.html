<p>In SQL Server 2012 and above you can use OFFSET FETCH clause, but in SQL Server 2005 and above you can use ROW_NUMBER() function. Here you have an example:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @PageNumber int = 1;
DECLARE @PageSize int = 20;

WITH Q AS
(
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TheOrderColumn) AS record_number
    FROM YourOriginalQuery
)
SELECT *
FROM Q
WHERE 
    record_number &gt; (@PageNumber - 1) * @PageSize
    AND record_number &lt;= @PageNumber * @PageSize
ORDER BY record_number;
</code></pre>
