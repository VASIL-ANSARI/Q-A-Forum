<p>It is because when you use normal event handlers, those are added to only those elements which satisfies the selector when the registration code is executed - in your case when the page is loaded the div may have the <code>hideShow</code> class only so only that handler will be added.</p>

<p>If you want the selector to be evaluated lazily then use the event deletation</p>

<p>You need to use event delegation</p>

<pre><code>//use document or any other immediate parent of the div
$(document).on('click', '.hideNshow', function(){
    //handle hide
})
//use document or any other immediate parent of the div
$(document).on('click', '.openNav ', function(){
    //handle show
})
</code></pre>
