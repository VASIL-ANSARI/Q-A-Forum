<p>MySQL supports stopwords for their full-text index (and provides a file in the source distribution):
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html</a></p>

<p>Maybe that file is a good startingpoint.</p>
