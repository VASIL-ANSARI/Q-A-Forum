<p>The duplicate EmailNotificationData object's id must be same as the previous former duplicate EmailNotificationData obj. Else hibernate wont know whether the duplicate object is already persisted. If id is set for EmailNotificationData obj, hibernate will know the obj is already persisted and hibernate will do and update on the obj. If id is not there, hibernate willl try to save and whatever unique constraints set in db will result in constraint violation exception.</p>
