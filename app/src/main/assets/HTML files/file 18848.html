<p>When you run malloc, you're just going to get random stuff in that memory segment. Some of it won't be able to be encoded into anything readable with ASCII. You could try printing the hex values of what's in memory with "%X" instead of "%c".</p>

<p>Though I have no idea why you would want to do such a thing.</p>
