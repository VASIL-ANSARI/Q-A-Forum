<p>Your assumption is correct. You must remember that you are still compiling a single C program. Your MCU OS is part of your program and doesn't contain a program loader or anything like that, and you only have one <code>main</code>.<br>
This really means that your program will behave like in any normal C program, there won't be any duplicate variables or hidden traps. The only weird point is that the OS is capable of switching tasks with magic.</p>
