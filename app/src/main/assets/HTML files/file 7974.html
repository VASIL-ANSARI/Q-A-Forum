<p>The event handlers are probably being added programmatically via script.  You could try to remove the event handlers (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.removeEventListener" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>), but it might be easier to clone the element in question, then hide the original. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node.cloneNode" rel="nofollow">cloneNode</a> documentation for information.</p>
