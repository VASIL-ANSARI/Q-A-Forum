<p>It's a problem of the last version. Check <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82157">here</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Meanwhile maybe it's better to use an older version. This one works fine:</p>

<p>compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:6.1.+' </p>

<p>Edit: Removing the global configuration meta-data from the AndroidManifest worked fine.</p>
