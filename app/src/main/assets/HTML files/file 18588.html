<p>iOS halts almost everything in response to user touch to guarantee it feels responsive. The setInterval issue is known, and there doesn't appear to be a workaround.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>During the "freeze" the timer will not catch up once the user releases the screen. The missed events are not deferred, but lost entirely (a bug).</p>
