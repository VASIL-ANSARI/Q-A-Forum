<p>The whole point of the pimpl idiom is that it's private and completely transparent to the users of the class. You don't expose it.</p>

<p>What you do need to do is make it clear that <code>A</code> isn't copyable:</p>

<pre><code>class_&lt;A, noncopyable&gt;("A", init&lt;&gt;())
    .def("B", &amp;A::B)
;
</code></pre>
