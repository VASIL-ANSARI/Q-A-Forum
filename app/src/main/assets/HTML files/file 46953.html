<p>You can run a native sql query with doctrine to achieve your objective. See an example here: <a href="http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/native-sql.html" rel="nofollow">http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/native-sql.html</a></p>

<p>The second option would be to <strong><em>use</em></strong> bidirectional associations. If performance is your concern you can enable the <code>LAZY</code> or <code>EXTRA_LAZY</code> fetch modes. Thus the performance will be minimally affected if at all.</p>

<p>More on <code>extra lazy</code> associations: <a href="http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/extra-lazy-associations.html" rel="nofollow">http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/extra-lazy-associations.html</a></p>

<p>In doctrine associations are considered lazy by default. This means that the entities will be fully loaded only if used (ie. property access, search, etc). </p>

<p>The <code>extra lazy</code> fetch mode diminishes even more the number of method which trigger a full entity hydration.</p>
