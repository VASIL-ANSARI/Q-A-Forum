<p>You could create a results <code>Map</code> within the <code>NFLTeam4</code> class. </p>

<pre><code>public class NFLTeam4
{
  private enum RESULT { WIN, LOSS };
  private Map&lt;RESULT, List&lt;NFLTeam4&gt;&gt; results = new HashMap&lt;RESULT, ArrayList&lt;NFLTeam4&gt;&gt;;
  // you can leave the constructor and other variables as they are

  public void winAGame(NFLTeam4 b) {
    win = win + 1;
    // Now check and add to your results map 
    // you will need to make sure your map is initialised properly
    results.get(RESULT.WIN).add(b);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You are encapsulating the behavior of winning or losing a game in your NFLTeam4 object. You could also extend the <code>RESULT</code> enum to include some information on the date, game number, venue, etc. of the result. </p>

<p>This is just an illustration on how this could work. You should consider how your objects are designed in light of the requirements.</p>
