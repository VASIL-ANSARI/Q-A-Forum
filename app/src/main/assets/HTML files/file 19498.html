<p>If you are trying to <code>INSERT</code> a value into the table <code>Articulos</code> that does not exist in the table <code>Fabricantes</code> then you will get the error.</p>

<p>Since you have a Foreign Key on the <code>Codigo</code> field, you have to have the same value in the <code>Fabricantes</code>.</p>

<p>See a <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/5acfc/1" rel="nofollow">non-working demo</a>.  This demo shows that the value for <code>Codigo</code> does not exist in the <code>Fabricantes</code> table so it throws the error message. Here is a <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/15171/1" rel="nofollow">working demo</a> which shows that the value is in the table first.</p>

<p>I think you need to redo the tables, slightly anyway. </p>

<pre><code>create table Fabricantes
(
  Codigo int identity primary key,
  Nombre nvarchar (100) not null
);

create table Articulos
(
  Codigo int primary key,
  Nombre nvarchar (100) not null,
  Precio int,
  Fabricante int,
  constraint FK_Fabricante foreign key
  (Codigo) references Fabricantes (Codigo)
);
</code></pre>

<p>You initially had the <code>Articulos</code> table with an <code>identity</code> set to it but since you have that field as the foreign key, I don't think you should have the <code>identity</code> on that table.</p>
