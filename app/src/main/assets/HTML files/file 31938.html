<p>You have two choices here. One option is to make the running thread into a "Daemon" thread. This means that the thread will not keep the program running, so if you close the JFrame and exit the application it will terminate immediately.</p>

<p>Be aware that the long running thread could potentially get terminated abruptly and in the middle of processing things though.</p>

<p>The (probably better) way is to call <code>interrupt()</code> on the thread and have the thread check <code>isInterrupted()</code> at regular intervals and exit cleanly if the flag is set.</p>
