<p>When I try it, both programs return a4cbeef10b3c6d44ca30d96370619eef</p>

<p>I have the feeling you're not giving us the whole picture. Show us the code leading up to this. In particular, check for newlines. Have you used chomp in the perl script?</p>

<p>Try for yourself. Here is the complete php script I used:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo md5("http://www.themobilemakeover.co.uk/mobile-makeover-appointment-booking-signup.php");
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is a complete perl script I used:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use Digest::Perl::MD5 'md5_hex';

$linkTrue = 'http://www.themobilemakeover.co.uk/mobile-makeover-appointment-booking-signup.php';
print md5_hex($linkTrue);
</code></pre>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Which if the two scripts is not returning that value for md5? That's the one that has a bug. Log the value that you're passing to md5, (with '[' before and ']' after to detect extra whitespace). Does that value match what you expect?</p>

<p>edit 2:</p>

<p>It looks like you found it, right? It's the single quotes. This:</p>

<pre><code>print md5_hex("'http://www.themobilemakeover.co.uk/mobile-makeover-appointment-booking-signup.php'");
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the extra quotes. The above line gives me: 486c944b10ef539aa7ba4bfe607861f2</p>
