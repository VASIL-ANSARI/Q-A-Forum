<p>Well, the answer to your question is "No".  Also, I don't fully understand your pseudo-SQL.  Where does @variable come from?</p>

<p>In any case, there are three answers to your question:</p>

<p>(1) The simplest is to store the list of values in a temporary table.  Then you can delete each one in the while loop.</p>

<p>(2) You can use cursors to go through the elements.</p>

<p>(3) You could concatenate the values into a string, and do complicated string manipulation in the while loop.</p>
