<p>It seems you do not run the command as root.</p>

<p>Try <code>sudo curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash-s stable - autolibs = homebrew - rails</code>.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, i just see this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14153005/rvm-installation-usr-local-rvm-permission-denied-before-this-i-deleted-ho">post</a>.
This issue can be due to oldest rvm installation and to solve it, you need to clean oldest installation.</p>

<p>To do that: <code>sudo rm -rf /etc/rvmrc /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh /usr/local/rvm</code>
Then, rerun your install command line.</p>

<p>Hope it will work.</p>
