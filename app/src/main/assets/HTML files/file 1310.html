<p>In sql terms concatenating null with any other value results in null.  </p>

<p>So, you have two choices.  First (and this is the way I would go), modify the ItemDescription field in your table to not be nullable.  Set a default value of something like '' (blank).  Problem goes away.</p>

<p>Second option, modify your linq code to coalesce the ItemDescription field to emit a blank if the underlying value is null.  I'm not a linq guy, so i'm unsure of how to do this.  </p>

<p>One of the problems with the second route is that it would have to run the coalesce function for each record in the products result set, which could have a negative performance hit.</p>
