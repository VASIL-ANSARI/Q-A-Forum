<p>Your button currently has an opacity of 1, and your fade effect isn't changing that.  You've also got some errant braces.  Something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('button').on('mouseenter', function(){
        $('button').fadeTo('slow',0);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
