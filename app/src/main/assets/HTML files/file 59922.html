<p>Avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>You can get and set such attributes via <code>getattr</code> and <code>setattr</code>, but they can't be accessed with ordinary dot syntax (something like <code>obj.class</code> is a syntax error), so they're a pain to use.</p>

<p>As Aurora0001 mentioned in a comment, a convention if you "need" to use them is to append an underscore.  The most common reason to "need" to have such attributes is that they're generated programatically from an external data source.</p>

<p>(Note that <code>type</code> is not a keyword, so you can do <code>self.type</code> just fine.)</p>
