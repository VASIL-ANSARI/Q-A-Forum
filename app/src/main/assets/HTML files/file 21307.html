<p>first off, i think you probably should NOT be doing whatever it is that you're trying to do.</p>

<p>second, to open the file...</p>

<pre><code>    name = request.params['name'] 
    app_dir = SEE_BELOW
    filename =  "%(app_dir)s/templates/%(name)s" % { 'app_dir':app_dir , 'name':name }
    filename =  "%s/templates/%s" % ( app_dir , name )
    with open(filename,'w') as file:
        file.write(new_comment)
</code></pre>

<p>i'm going to note a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>app_dir - i forget how to get the actual pyramid app dir.  i usually get spooked by this stuff, so only use specific subdirectories like such:</li>
</ol>

<p>env.ini
    templates_writable_dir = %(here)s/app/templates/writable/</p>

<p>then i can access it via:
    request.registry.settings['templates_writable_dir']</p>

<p>note that i made a specific writable subfolder.  i don't want the main stuff writable.  i'll chmod/grp that writable folder so the user pyramid runs as can ed it.  i won't allow that user to write to anything else.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>"tutorial:templates/{name}.html"</code> that is using the templated syntax, which only works in the templates. one of your pyramid plugins injects the <code>renderer_dict</code> into the template and renders it for you.  you need to use normal python string formatting, as i showed above using two options.</li>
</ol>

<p>More importantly... </p>

<p>based on your question, you're not just new to pyramid but to python too.  i'd suggest doing a few quick python tutorials before jumping into Pyramid - or any other framework.</p>
