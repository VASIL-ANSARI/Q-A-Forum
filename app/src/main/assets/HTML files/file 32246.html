<p>How big is your database? How many users do you have in your <code>userIndex</code> ?</p>

<p>What is your memory / heap configuration? I assume you run into a lot of GC issues, as Cypher tries to fit the whole db into memory for your queries.</p>

<p>Also on cold caches and little memory you basically measure disk speed to pull the data into memory.</p>

<p>You can combine your queries into one.</p>

<pre><code>START user=node:userIndex("Username:*")
RETURN has(user.FullNodeCreationTime),has(user.NumFollowers), COUNT(*) AS num
</code></pre>

<p>that should return 4 entries for the 4 combos which you can easily use / aggregate</p>

<p>All of these are not graph queries, and also graph global queries. So neither Neo4j nor Cypher  are optimized for them :)</p>
