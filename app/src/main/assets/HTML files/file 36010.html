<p>You need to tell the outer box sizer that it should expand the horizontal child sizer as well:</p>

<pre><code>vertSizer-&gt;Add(horizSizer, 0, wxEXPAND);
</code></pre>

<p>The second parameter, 0, tells the vertical sizer to expand the child sizer only horizontally. For box sizers, passing 0 as the second parameter and wxEXPAND as (part of) the third will make sure that the added child control or sizer is expanded in the "other" direction, i.e., for a vertical sizer, the child is expanded horizontally whereas for a horizontal sizer, the child is expanded vertically.</p>

<p>Passing 1 as the second parameter will, as you already know from the text box, expand in both directions.</p>
