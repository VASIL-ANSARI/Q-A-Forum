<p>If you want to do multiple operations inside a lambda, you will have to write it as</p>

<pre><code>num-&gt; {
  return num/=dim;
}
</code></pre>

<p>with a <code>return</code> statement to get the final output.  If you write lambdas like this with braces, it is exactly like implementing a function: you need a <code>return</code> statement, but you may have as much code as you like inside the lambda.</p>
