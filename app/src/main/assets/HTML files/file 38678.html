<p>In the code in the question, the <code>StateManager</code> function does not create a closure, as it doesn't reference "free" variables from outside it's lexical scope.</p>

<p>However the jQuery callbacks are in fact closures, as they do reference the <code>self</code> variable which is defined outside the lexical scope of the callback functions.</p>

<p>A closure is, from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures" rel="nofollow"><strong>MDN</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. </p>
  
  <p>In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A simple example would be something like</p>

<pre><code>function something() {

    var test = "Hello Kitty"; // "test" is a local variable created in this scope

    function otherFunc() { // this is an inner function, a closure
        alert( test ); // uses variable declared in the parent function
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>That's about as simple as closure gets, it's just a function inside another function that uses variables outside it's lexical scope.</p>

<p>Another familiar example would be</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {  // creates outer scope

    var data = 'important stuff';

    $('.elems').on('click', function() { // this is a closure
         $(this).text( data ); // uses variable outside it's scope
    });

});
</code></pre>
