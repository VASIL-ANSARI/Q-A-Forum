<p>I think your issue can be fixed by just mirroring all the edges in your graph dictionary, like:</p>

<pre><code>graph = {0 : {1:28, 3:33},
1 : {2:10, 4:44},
2 : {3:50},
3 : {4:30},
4 : {}}
# Mirror all edges
for u in graph:
    for v in graph[u]:
        if not u in graph[v]:
            graph[v][u] = graph[u][v]
</code></pre>

<p>That's the easiest way of setting up your input as an undirected graph (although obviously now you need to be more careful if you then edit/delete edges). When I insert this into your code, I get:</p>

<pre><code> __0__1__2__3__4

0| 0 28 38 33 63

1| 28 0 10 60 44

2| 38 10 0 50 54

3| 33 60 50 0 30

4| 63 44 54 30 0
</code></pre>
