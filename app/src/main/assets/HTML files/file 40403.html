<p>The purpose of PHP is that it runs on the server and <strong>not</strong> the client, and this is for security reasons, dynamic webpage generating, and permanent storage. If you are simply testing this on your laptop on a web browser, it won't work because the computer is not running the PHP software that interprets the PHP code. PHP can only run on a web server that is actually running the proper software. If the client could run PHP, things would not be good because then the client would be able to see data that is meant to be kept safe.</p>
