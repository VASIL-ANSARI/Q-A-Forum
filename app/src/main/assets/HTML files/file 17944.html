<p>Your routes should look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>resources :feeds do
  resources :lists
end
</code></pre>

<p>The clue that it's a routing problem is in the route that was generated; both of the parameters are called <code>id</code>, so the same value is put into the URL twice.  The correctly generated route should be <code>feeds/:feed_id/lists/:id</code> (note the different parameters: <code>feed_id</code> and <code>id</code>).</p>

<p>You should now be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>feed_list_path(list, @feed)  # =&gt; "/feeds/41/lists/5"
feed_list_url(list, @feed)   # =&gt; "http://yoursite/feeds/41/lists/5"
url_for [@feed, list]        # =&gt; "http://yoursite/feeds/41/lists/5"
</code></pre>
