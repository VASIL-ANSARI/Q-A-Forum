<p>The latest X records per group is a tough problem in MySQL, except when X is 1 as in your case. You can do it like this. For each quote, join all rows that have the same quote_no, but a greater version., or the same version but with a larger ID. Then you can apply a filter to only keep those rows that don't have a greater version:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  t1.*
FROM  
  YourTable t1
  LEFT JOIN YourTable t2 ON
       t2.quote_no = t1.quote_no AND -- Quote must match anyway
       ( t2.version &gt; t1.version OR -- Version must be larger
         ( t2.version = t1.version AND -- Or if version is the same... 
           t2.ID &gt; t1.ID )      -- ID must be larger.
WHERE
  t2.quote_no IS NULL
</code></pre>
