<p>This is not possible to achieve that with ProcessBuilder running the external application. You just can't say to <code>vlc.exe</code> to load another movie and play. Every time you should re-create the instance of <code>vlc.exe</code>. Although if your video is played correctly you should not worry about closing of previous instance of <code>vlc.exe</code>. System will do it properly and new instance will replace existing one.</p>
