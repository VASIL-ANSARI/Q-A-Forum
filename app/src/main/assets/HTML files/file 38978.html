<p>From the Python docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>map(function, iterable, ...)</p>
  
  <p>...If one iterable is shorter than another it is
  assumed to be extended with None items...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd guess that your lists are not the same length so that it's trying to subtract a None from a float.</p>
