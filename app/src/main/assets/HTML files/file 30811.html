<p>You can't prevent a blank form from being submitted by various techniques.  Your server should be validating the form and rejecting submissions that are not proper.  This is a core fundamental of any server that accepts data from any outside source.  It must do its own data validation before accepting the data.</p>

<p>It is possible to make a form such that the browser can't submit it to your site via a plain browser without javascript being enabled.  For example, if there's no default action for the form in the HTML and the submit action is only implemented in javascript, then the form wouldn't submit if javascript was disabled.  There would still be other ways to submit the data without client-side verification which is why server-side validation is always required, but this might stop some user mistakes before they get to your server. </p>

<p>You can also use the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag to advise the user that javascript is required.</p>

<p>You can identify many form submissions from robots server-side immediately by just including a form in your field that is populated with a known value via javascript.  If, when the form is received on your server, that known value is not present in the form, then the form is likely submitted by something other than a browser with javascript enabled.</p>

<p>You can prevent automatic robot submissions by just not using a regular form action in your HTML.  If the submission URL is only in your javascript and the submissions is only done via javascript, then most robots will never see it and never even know to try (because they don't run javascript).</p>

<p>FYI, neither of these last two techniques will prevent hackers from submitting rogue forms/data since they may analyze things enough to understand what is missing, but they can help identify automated attempts at submissions.</p>
