<p>You can redefine it as a block element and then set width to it: <code>a{display:block;width:400px}</code>. </p>

<p>EDIT: However, in this case it will start on a new line and the next piece of text will also be in a new line. What solves the problem, is <code>inline-block</code> display mode, but this again has problems with older versions of IE and FF (see here: <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=inline-block">http://caniuse.com/#search=inline-block</a>)</p>
