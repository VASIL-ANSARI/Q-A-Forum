<p>The problem is that when you include <em>EntityControl.h</em> you have also included <em>Fish.h</em> which refers to <code>Fish</code> defined in <em>Fish.h</em>. However <em>EntityControl.h</em> refers to <em>Fish.h</em> which won't get included because of the <code>pragma once</code> directive. If you remove <code>pragma once</code> then you'd get an infinite loop because of circular dependency.</p>

<p>To solve the problem of circular dependencies use forward declarations.
Remove <code>#include "EntityControl.h"</code> from <em>Fish.h</em> and write <code>class EntityControl;</code> instead.</p>

<p>You may also remove <code>#include "Fish.h";</code> from <em>EntityControl.h</em> and write <code>class Fish;</code> in its stead.</p>
