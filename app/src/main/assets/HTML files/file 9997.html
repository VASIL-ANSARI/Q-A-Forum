<p>example.com (or exmaple.com as typo'd in the tutorial) is a placeholder link used in documents. You are supposed to replace it with your own hostname, i.e. if you are developing on a local webserver <a href="http://localhost/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/</a>, like this: <a href="http://localhost/helloworld/index/index" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/helloworld/index/index</a></p>
