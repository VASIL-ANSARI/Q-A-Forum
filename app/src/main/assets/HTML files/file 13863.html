<p>It is not a good idea to use the data as the schema; in particular, an awful lot of names <strong>are not valid</strong> as xml element names, but also: it just isn't good practice (for example, it makes it virtually useless in terms of schema validation). If you want to be terse, maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Employees&gt;
    &lt;Add Name="Hari" Age="30" /&gt;
&lt;/Employees&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Employees&gt;
    &lt;Employee Name="Hari" Age="30" /&gt;
&lt;/Employees&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which can be done simply with:</p>

<pre><code>[XmlArray("Employees"), XmlArrayItem("Employee")]
public List&lt;Employee&gt; Employees {get;set;}
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>public class Employee {
    [XmlAttribute]
    public string Name {get;set;}
    [XmlAttribute]
    public int Age {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>XmlSerializer</code> does not support the "content as an element name" serializer, unless you do everything yourself with <code>IXmlSerializable</code> <strong><em>from the parent element</em></strong> (it would have to be from the parent, as <code>XmlSerializer</code> would have no way of identifying the child to handle there).</p>
