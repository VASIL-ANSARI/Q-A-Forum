<p>IÂ´d start by checking the Facebook API information, which is very extensive and clear:</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/notifications/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/notifications/</a></p>

<p>Then if you have any issues with the code that you have written, you can post it and anyone out here will be happy to help you solving your problems with it.</p>
