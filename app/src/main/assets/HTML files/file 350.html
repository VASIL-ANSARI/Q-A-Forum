<p>Our development team has had success with defining the name of a Web User Control in the database. Upon page load it checks too see what controls to dynamically load from the database. </p>

<p>We use Web User Controls instead of Web Forms in order to ensure we can use the control on any page.</p>

<p>You can also dynamically build a site map using ASP.Net's provider. <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/dynamicsitemap.aspx" rel="nofollow">CodeProject</a> has a good example.</p>
