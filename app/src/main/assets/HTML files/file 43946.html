<p>I'm not sure how Xcode chose another provisioning profile, when you explicitly selected another.</p>

<p>If I were you I would find and delete the "XC: Rajib" provisioning profile and start over (restarting Xcode in the process).</p>

<p>I guess you <em>could</em> give Xcode the benefit of the doubt, by turning down the <code>Binary and Entitlements</code> triangle and carefully checking the entitlements then submitting if they're right... but I wouldn't feel good about it.</p>
