<p><code>Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> is a constant and thus not overwritable, whereas <code>Infinity</code> is a property of <code>window</code> and is overwritable:</p>

<pre><code>Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY = 123;
Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY; // Infinity

Infinity = 123;
Infinity; // 123
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same thing as <code>undefined</code> or <code>NaN</code>, which are basically properties of <code>window</code> and overwritable. It is not a good thing to rely on <code>window.undefined</code> either; rather you want to produce a 'real' <code>undefined</code> yourself (like in a self-executed function where you don't pass an argument but do declare it in the function).</p>

<p>Specs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>15.7.3.6 <code>Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code></p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> is <code>+â</code>.</p>
  
  <p>This property has the attributes <code>{ [[Writable]]:</code><strong><code>false</code></strong><code>, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: false }</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ES5, the overwriting ability has been removed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>15.1.1: The value properties <code>NaN</code>, <code>Infinity</code>, and <code>undefined</code> of the Global Object have been changed to be read-only properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About <code>isFinite</code>: I once posted a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5690071/why-check-for-isnan-after-isfinite">question</a> as to why the Google Closure Library implements a custom function for <code>isFinite</code>, and the answer was that there was probably some cross-browser inconsistency, although it's unclear which browser and which inconsistency.</p>
