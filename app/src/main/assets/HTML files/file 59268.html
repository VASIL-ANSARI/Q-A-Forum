<p>Although the distinction between "system call" and "library function" can be a useful one to keep in mind, there's the issue that you have to be able to call system calls somehow.  In general, then, every system call is present in the C library -- as a thin little library function that does nothing but make the transfer to the system call (however that's implemented).</p>

<p>So, yes, you can call <code>open()</code> from C code if you want to.  (And somewhere, perhaps in a file called <code>fopen.c</code>, the author of your C library probably called it too, within the implementation of <code>fopen()</code>.)</p>
