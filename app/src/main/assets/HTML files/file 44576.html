<p>Given your code, there could be some hypothesis. The most probable is that <code>ShowAreas</code> stores the information in an non ordered data structure (for example an <code>HashMap</code>). </p>

<p>If you want to maintain your values in order , you have to use some additional data structure. For example, you can use a <code>TreeSet</code> for the values. </p>

<p>Another solution could be to sort the values immediatly before returning them (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List)" rel="nofollow">javadoc</a>),   </p>

<pre><code>// Get the elements
List&lt;Areas&gt; areas = new ArrayList&lt;Areas&gt;(ShowAreas.values());
// Sort them
Collections.sort(areas);
// Return them
return areas;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pay attention</strong>: if you want to use this method, the class <code>Areas</code> must implement <code>Comparable</code>.</p>

<p>A last advise: don't put the code that interacts with the database in the class that has the responsibility to receive external REST calls. You violates the <em>single responsibility principle</em> and your application will become unmaintainable very quickly. Try to use a structure <em>Controller</em> - <em>Service</em> - <em>Repository</em>.</p>
