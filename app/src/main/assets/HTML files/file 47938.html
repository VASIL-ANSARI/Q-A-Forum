<p>Note that self.layer always returns a generic CALayer inside a UIView, so you have to typecast it to your specific class to make sure that it has the correct type. You can do the following to make sure that you call path to CAShapeLayer not to CALayer class type.</p>

<pre><code>   override class func layerClass() -&gt; AnyClass {
        return CAShapeLayer.self
    }

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        guard let shapeLayer = self.layer as? CAShapeLayer else { return }

         let path: UIBezierPath = UIBezierPath.init(ovalInRect: CGRectMake(0, 0, 30, 10))
        shapeLayer.path = path.CGPath
    }
</code></pre>
