<p>In the jQuery mobile CSS file <a href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.css">linked here</a>, search for this string:</p>

<p><code>.ui-corner-tr {</code></p>

<p>I don't know if you're even using the default styles, but there's what I found based on the info you provided.</p>

<p>You should be able to change all four corners in that area (as <code>.ui-corner-tr</code>, <code>.ui-corner-tl</code>, <code>.ui-corner-br</code>, <code>.ui-corner-bl</code>, etc., etc.)</p>
