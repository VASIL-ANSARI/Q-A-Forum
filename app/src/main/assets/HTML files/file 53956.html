<p>I finally figured out where the problem came from. I compared what you send to your server with curl in comment above, and what you try to send from android. And these two things are completly difirent. To send the same from androdid, you should form your urlParameter like that:</p>

<pre><code>JSONObject info = new JSONObject();
info.put("info",parent);
urlParameters = info.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>And don't forget to do <code>connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json")</code> after <code>connection.setDoOutput(true)</code>.</p>

<p>I tested it outside android, and it returned pretty the same as curl command from your comment above. It should work just fine in android.</p>

<p>PS: Please, be more more attentive next time. </p>
