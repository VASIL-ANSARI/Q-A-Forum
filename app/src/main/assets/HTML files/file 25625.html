<p>getResources is actually a method you can access from your Context.  So you can really think of this as:</p>

<pre><code>context.getResources()
</code></pre>

<p>Your Activity class is your context in this case, which is why you can just call it with the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>getResources()
</code></pre>

<p>From those docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interface to global information about an application environment. This
  is an abstract class whose implementation is provided by the Android
  system. It allows access to application-specific resources and
  classes, as well as up-calls for application-level operations such as
  launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents, etc.</p>
