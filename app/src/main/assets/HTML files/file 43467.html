<p>Suggestion: <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> has various query methods that return a <code>Cursor</code>.  A <code>Cursor</code> can be used to make a <code>CursorAdapter</code>.  So one approach might be to wrap the <code>CursorAdapter</code> with a <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code> and delegate to the <code>CursorAdapter</code>.  This would be appropriate especially if you read your data once and the <code>ListView</code> does not have to be notified about data modified by refresh queries.</p>

<p>If you don't know about <code>CursorLoader</code>, look into how that works.  That is the best way to get <code>Cursor</code>s from queries, since the <code>CursorLoader</code> takes care of running all the database queries in the background.  When the <code>CursorLoader</code> completes, take the resulting <code>Cursor</code> and create the <code>CursorAdapter</code>, then take that and create your <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code> subclass.</p>
