<p>I figured it out, of course it was an amateur mistake!
So, example.com and www.example.com are different things. 
In our case www.example.com redirects to example.com, in that case the post data is lost and the api sees it as a get! Silly mistake but kinda funny. Hopefully it will help someone else! </p>
