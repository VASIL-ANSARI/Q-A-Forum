<p>If this is a quick synchronous transaction (round trip), The client's call when it sends file-A.xml to the WSA can be held until WSA receives a response from WSB, and send it as part of it's response.</p>

<p>In an asynchronous case, WSA would need to communicate with the Client if it is able to call it, or perhaps store the response, and wait for the Client to retrieve it at a later time.  This may involve the Client polling WSA in case the WSB response is not available yet.</p>
