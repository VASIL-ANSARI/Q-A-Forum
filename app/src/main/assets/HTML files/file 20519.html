<p>I argue that the main reason of your question (hiding the URL of the PDF file) is for security issues.
E.g. you have some PDF files on your server that have to be sent and read only from intended audience and not from everybody.</p>

<p>I give you some basic  hints on how to realize this intent:</p>

<ul>
<li>place the PDF files out of the public root of your webserver</li>
<li>realize a server side script that:
<ul>
<li>check is the user is authenticated and have the grant to get the file</li>
<li>get some parmeters to retrieve the correct file</li>
<li>serve the file with this server side script content-disposition (as attachment, sending the correct Mime-Type and a "ficticious" URL)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Since you put C# in your question tags i address you on
Add a content-disposition to the header with C#:
Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", @"attachment;filename=""MyFile.pdf""");</p>

<p>Then you can display your pdf wherever u wish: blank page, iframe ...
It is sure you'll not find a solution just working with HTML/Javascript, not one of those easly to avoid for a medium level internet user.</p>
