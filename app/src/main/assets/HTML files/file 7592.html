<p>Unfortunately thats not possible, the browsers work with iframes as if these are different tabs, so they have a different set of javascript and css files.</p>

<p>The only thing you could do is using js access the iframe and execute some js over it to make it include your own css. The problem with this approach is that browsers doesn't allow you to communicate with an iframe unless they share the same domain... and from what you say thats not the case...</p>
