<p>You're <em>much</em> better off ignoring regex completely if you can do simple string processing instead. An email is <a href="http://davidcel.is/posts/stop-validating-email-addresses-with-regex/" rel="nofollow">notoriously hard</a> to create a regex for.</p>

<p>So far, if you've got a consistent pattern, it looks like you can find the lines with <code>From:</code> and <code>Date:</code> and parse the rest of the line appropriately. PHP has a <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php" rel="nofollow">decent set of functions</a> to split and manipulate strings, so try that first.</p>
