<p>You can run the following statement in your java program. Before that you need to know the name of the task in <code>task manager</code>. Say you want to see MS-Word is running. Then run MS-Word, go to task manager and under the process tab, you should see a process named <code>word.exe</code>. Figure out the name for the process you are targeting. Once you have that, you just run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>String line;
String pidInfo ="";

Process p =Runtime.getRuntime().exec(System.getenv("windir") +"\\system32\\"+"tasklist.exe");

BufferedReader input =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));

while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
    pidInfo+=line; 
}

input.close();

if(pidInfo.contains("your process name"))
{
    // do what you want
}
</code></pre>
