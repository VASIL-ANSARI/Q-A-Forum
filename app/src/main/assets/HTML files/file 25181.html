  <p>I have some heavily created UI elements inside tabs which take some time to be created</p>

<p>If "some time" is more than ~5 milliseconds, your app is broken and needs to be fixed. Use Traceview to determine precisely where you are spending your time, then repair matters so that it takes less time on the main application thread.</p>

  <p>What is the correct way to create fragments inside tabs ONCE and avoid recreating their view when swipping between other tabs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AFAIK, <code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code> should not have the effect that you are describing (though <code>FragmentStatePagerAdapter</code> will). But, again, if you fix your <code>onCreateView()</code> performance issue, even <code>FragmentStatePagerAdapter</code> will not post a problem.</p>
