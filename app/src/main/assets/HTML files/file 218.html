<p>What do you mean?
Are you saying that when you go from www.mysmallwebsite.com to www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/ then the PHP session is lost?</p>

<p>PHP recognizes the session with an ID (alpha-numeric hash generated on the server). The ID is passed from request to request using a cookie called PHPSESSID or something like that (you can view the cookies a websites sets with the help of your browser ... on Firefox you have Firebug + FireCookie and the wonderful Web Developer Toolbar ... with which you can view the list of cookies without a sweat).</p>

<p>So ... PHP is passing the session ID through the PHPSESSID cookie. But you can pass the session ID as a plain GET request parameters.</p>

<p>So when you place the html link to the ugly domain name, assuming that it is the same PHP server (with the same sessions initialized), you can put it like this ...</p>

<pre><code>www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/?PHPSESSID=&lt;?=session_id()?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't worked with PHP for a while, but I think this will work. </p>
