<p>All looks fine. Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>files are case sensitive</li>
<li>check if the folder <code>Photolocation</code> has write permission (it usually will for you can write to the location)</li>
<li>close the <strong>handle</strong> after you've created the file. If the handle is still open, delete is not possible</li>
<li>check with <code>file_exists()</code> just to make sure the file does exist</li>
<li>did you create the <code>file</code> or a <code>shortcut</code>? </li>
<li>when creating the file, do not suppress possible errors. It might be a header problem in the created file itself. Check your error-files for clues. </li>
</ul>
