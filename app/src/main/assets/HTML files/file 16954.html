<p>Run your flask app under a proper WSGI server capable of handling concurrent requests (perhaps <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a> or <a href="http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/">uWSGI</a>) and it'll work. While developing, enable threads in the Flask-supplied server with:</p>

<pre><code>app.run(threaded=True)
</code></pre>

<p>but note that the Flask server is not recommended for production use.</p>

<p>What happens is that using requests you are making a <em>second</em> request to your flask app, but since it is still busy processing the first, it won't respond to this second request until it is done with that first request.</p>
