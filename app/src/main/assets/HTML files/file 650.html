<p>If there are no virtual functions, then it shouldn't. If there are then there is a performance impact in calling the virtual functions as these are called via function pointers or other indirect methods (depends on the situation). However, I do not think that the impact is related to the depth of the inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Brian, to be clear and answer your comment. If there are no virtual functions anywhere in your inheritance tree, then there is no performance impact.</p>
