<p>The best is to modify the sql stqtement of your SqlDataSource2 to include the "sum of all transactions for that account".
This will give something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Select u.Account, u.Type, count(t.Account) as NumberTransactions
From User u inner join Transactions t on u.Account = t.Account
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know the exact name of your tables so this is just an example.
After that, for your Repeater you have the Account, Type and NumberTransaction from the same datasource.</p>
