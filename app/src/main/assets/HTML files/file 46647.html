<p>When you define <code>total</code> inside the while loop, it reassigns itself to <code>0 + end</code> each time it loops, which is 1 by the end of the program. When you define it outside, it sets <code>total</code> to 0, then for each loop within <code>while</code>, it continues to add the value to it.</p>

<p>Also, sidenote, you can write <code>total = total + end</code> as <code>total += end</code> and it means the same thing but is actually a (very) small bit faster.</p>
