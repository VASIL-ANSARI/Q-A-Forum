<p>When <code>os.path.abspath(file)</code> parses a string, it first looks at <code>\{char}</code> to see if it's a special escaped character, and only then if it isn't one, does it treat it like a normal part of a path. </p>

<p>You need to treat your path as a raw string by adding <code>r"...."</code> to get the desired output:</p>

<pre><code>path = r'c:\Users\JEHOSHAPHAKSHAY\Desktop\temp'
os.path.abspath(path)
&gt;&gt; 'c:\\Users\\JEHOSHAPHAKSHAY\\Desktop\\temp'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, by saying making it a raw string you tell the interpeter to ignore special escaped characters and just look at each char as exactly that - just a character.</p>

<p>You can see this succinctly in @phihag's answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11340546/unable-to-get-a-valid-pathname-from-python-os-path-abspath">here</a></p>
