<p>Applets have many resctrictions including network restrictions. Don't forget that applets run from the client side and not server side, therefore as a policy, applet was restricted to access company internal networks (the private networks)...</p>

<p>In short, your code is trying to access your database server (as it never connects because of the network restrictions placed on applets). It's trying to call a private network from a client side. Javascript follows the same restriction as it must never access a private network from client side.</p>
