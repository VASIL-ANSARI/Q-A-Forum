<p>Popup functionality for footnotes is not a built-in part of the epub spec. Apple has implemented it for iBooks as long as you mark the code up properly with epub:type declarations. You'll want the superscripted number set up like <code>&lt;a href=#note24 epub:type="noteref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;</code> and the corresponding footnote to be <code>&lt;p id="note24" epub:type="footnote"&gt;Content goes here&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p>The important bits are the epub:type declarations. Note that use of epub:type implies that you're using epub 3.0 rather than epub 2.0.1. If you're just using MS Word,then you're out of luck on that score.</p>
