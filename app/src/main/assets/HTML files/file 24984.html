<p>A little bit hard to tell here, but it looks like your "attach"value is "#" (a string). Try doing something like ...</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= @post.attach.inspect %&gt;</code></p>

<p>to see for sure or even just ...</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= @post.inspect %&gt;</code></p>

<p>to see what they are. Is it possible that "attach" should be "attachment"?</p>
