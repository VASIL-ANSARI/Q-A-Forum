<p>no regex needed:</p>

<pre><code>l = []

with open("name_file", "r") as f:
   for line in f:
       l.append(line.split(", "))
</code></pre>

<p>if you want to remove first space and to have tuple you can do:</p>

<pre><code>l = []

with open("name_file", "r") as f:
   for line in f:
       data = line.split(", ")
       l.append((data[0].strip(), data[1].strip()))
</code></pre>
