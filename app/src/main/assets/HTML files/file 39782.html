<p>On linux, the <code>readline</code> module considers <code>-</code> a delimiter for tab completion. That is, after a <code>-</code> is encountered a fresh completion will be tried.</p>

<p>The solution to your problem is the remove <code>-</code> from the set of characters used by readline as delimiters.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>old_delims = readline.get_completer_delims()
readline.set_completer_delims(old_delims.replace('-', ''))
</code></pre>
