<p>Acording to this <a href="http://www.androprogrammer.com/2015/05/android-wear-how-to-send-data-from.html" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>, make sure that the <code>applicationId</code> in the main app and wearable app are matched (build.gradle files) in order for the <code>WearableListenerService</code> to fire the <code>onDataChanged</code> event. Because when you send some data through mobile app or wear app, it will check for the same package to pass that data. So if you give different name, you won't be able to send or receive data.</p>
