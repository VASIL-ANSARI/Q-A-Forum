<p>To use DB Mail then you would need to open the Maintenance Plan in BIDs and then add an Execute SQL Task that sends a mail by using a stored procedure.</p>

<p>Having said this however, what I would advise you do is to ad a send mail task to the maintenance plan, and then add an on failure precedence constraint between the tasks and the send mail task.</p>

<p>You could also achieve the same (more elegantly) by opening the maintenance plan in BIDS and adding an On Error event handler, and put the Send Mail task in there.</p>
