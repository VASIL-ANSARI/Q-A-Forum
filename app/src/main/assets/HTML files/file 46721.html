<p>Have you tried allocating your bitmap outside of your render loop? Depending on the size of the bitmap, it could really slow things down. You're allocating and re-allocating space for that bitmap each iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Move its allocation outside of the loop and then render it (that one allocation) in your render loop.</p>
