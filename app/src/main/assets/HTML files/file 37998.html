<p>You can can do a search for additional collections, you are not limited to what is shown the only limitations that I know of is the use of a generic collection.  You can always use an <code>ArrayList</code> or there is a <code>StringCollection</code> available. You can get to them by clicking the browse then navigating to <code>mscorlib --&gt; System.Collections --&gt; ArrayList</code> or  <code>System --&gt; System.Collections.Specialized --&gt; StringCollection</code>.  But since you are needing an object I would probably use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.arraylist(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList</code></a> since it appears that Generics are not an option in this situation.</p>
