<p>When you run the function <code>$form-&gt;isValid()</code>, it checks against the form it built in the <code>buildForm</code> function. Any extra fields/value that aren't there will cause this error.</p>

<p>You can change this behaviour by using <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/form/dynamic_form_modification.html" rel="nofollow">form events</a>.</p>
