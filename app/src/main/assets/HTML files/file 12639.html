<p>I'd recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow"><code>Mechanize</code></a> module. It allows you to select a form, fill fields, select options, and click buttons. It automatically generates the form data that the form would have submitted in a normal browser.</p>

<p>Here's a nice little tutorial/example: <a href="http://stockrt.github.com/p/emulating-a-browser-in-python-with-mechanize/" rel="nofollow">http://stockrt.github.com/p/emulating-a-browser-in-python-with-mechanize/</a></p>
