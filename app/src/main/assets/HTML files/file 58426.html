<p>From <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbf85k1c.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Binary &amp; operators are predefined for the integral types and bool. For
  integral types, &amp; computes the logical bitwise AND of its operands.
  For bool operands, &amp; computes the logical AND of its operands; that
  is, the result is true if and only if both its operands are true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case it is integeral type version.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code> 50 in binary is 00110010     
100 in binary is 01100100     
AND result is    00100000 (32 dec)
</code></pre>
