<p>It's not clear why you're trying to loop, but the <code>Arrays.sort</code> methods operating on <em>primitive</em> arrays don't allow a custom comparator to be specified.</p>

<p>The simplest approach would be to sort and then reverse the array. I can't immediately find a <code>reverse</code> method which would take an <code>int[]</code> but it would be easy to write your own.</p>
