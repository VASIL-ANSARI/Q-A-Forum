<p>Seems like you're passing it a float. And in the error message you provide (full message next time please!) it appears that matplotlib is simply delegating the conversion to <code>datetime.datetime.fromordinal</code>. </p>

<p>I don't have a Python 3 installation to test this with, but when I tried to convert a float to a <code>datetime</code> object using <code>datetime.datetime.fromordinal</code> in 2.6, I got a deprecation warning. Then I tried it on <a href="http://ideone.com/bQ6yv" rel="nofollow">ideone</a> and got this:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "prog.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(datetime.datetime.fromordinal(5.5))
TypeError: integer argument expected, got float
</code></pre>

<p>So perhaps it's choking on the float. </p>
