<p>Since it seems like you are just trying to output the file as is, with only change being to substitute HTML line breaks <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> instead of new line characters why not simplify things?</p>

<pre><code>echo nl2br(file_get_contents('City.csv'), true);
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you don't want to read the whole file into memory:</p>

<pre><code>$file = fopen('City.csv', 'r');
while(!feof($file)) {       
    echo nl2br(fgets($file), true);
}
fclose($file);
</code></pre>

<p>In one of the comments above you mention that you want the city and city values available as variables (though your code example doesn't seem to indicate this).  If that is the case, try <code>fgetcsv()</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$file = fopen('City.csv', 'r');
while($values = fgetcsv($file)) {
    $city = $values[0];
    $city_code = $values[1];
    echo $city . ',' . $city_code . '&lt;br /&gt;';
}
fclose($file);
</code></pre>
