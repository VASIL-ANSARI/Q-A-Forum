<blockquote>
  <p>Here, componentDidMount is a method called automatically by React when a component is rendered. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept is that you're telling ReactJS, "please take this thing, this comment box or spinning image or whatever it is I want on the browser page, and go ahead and actually put it on the browser page. When that's done, call my function that I've bound to <code>componentDidMount</code> so I can proceed."</p>

<p><code>componentWillMount</code> is the opposite. It will fire immediately BEFORE your component renders.</p>

<p>Finally, the "mount" term seems to be unique to react.js. I don't think it is a general javascript concept, or even a general browser concept.</p>
