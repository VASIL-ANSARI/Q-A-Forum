<p>Did some troubleshooting and this is what I got:</p>

<p>URL Encode/decode is not the problem. String before encoding and after decoding are the same:</p>

<p>Before encoding:</p>

<pre><code>string 'Ã¨?Â¡OÃ¹pU4ËÃâ¢Ã½Â£ÃGÃÃ´Â½Ã¥Lqe 2wÂ¨ââÃÂ¢Â§|MÃ¾WÃ¾xÃZÂ±8âÃâÃÂ©Ãâ Å½Å¡ÃkÃ¨Ã­SÃ²Ã¸Ãâ¬Â¥Ã°Ã(Â³!Â§Â¬Å¾IÃª\&amp;' (length=96)
</code></pre>

<p>After decoding:</p>

<pre><code>string 'Ã¨?Â¡OÃ¹pU4ËÃâ¢Ã½Â£ÃGÃÃ´Â½Ã¥Lqe 2wÂ¨ââÃÂ¢Â§|MÃ¾WÃ¾xÃZÂ±8âÃâÃÂ©Ãâ Å½Å¡ÃkÃ¨Ã­SÃ²Ã¸Ãâ¬Â¥Ã°Ã(Â³!Â§Â¬Å¾IÃª\&amp;' (length=96)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is in the encryption / decryption process.</p>

<p>Json string before encrypting:</p>

<pre><code>string '{"entry1":{"name":"bob","age":"15"},"entry2":{"name":"bill","age":"50"}}' (length=72)
</code></pre>

<p>Json string after decrypting:</p>

<pre><code>string '{"entry1":{"name":"bob","age":"15"},"entry2":{"name":"bill","age":"50"}}ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½' (length=96)
</code></pre>

<p>See the extra garbage characters added to the end. </p>

<p>After decrypting if you do this to trim out the garbage characters, your json decodes fine:</p>

<pre><code>json_decode(substr($decrypted,0,72));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not very familiar with <code>mcrypt</code>, so hopefully someone can help you figure out why you're getting the additional characters at the end.</p>
