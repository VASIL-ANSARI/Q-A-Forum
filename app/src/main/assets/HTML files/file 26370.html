<ul>
<li>Use ajax to bring the form as a popup (use either Bootstrap's or jQuery UI)</li>
<li>If it's a static form, you can add jQuery code to replace the content when change has been detected in each part, using show and hide or other effects to do this</li>
<li>Multipart forms in general are called 'form wizards'. Django has a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard/" rel="nofollow">Form Wizard system</a> built in, you might want to use that (especially if the form is dynamic).</li>
<li>for both simplicity on your development side, and just common sense, I highly recommend that you <strong>Don't</strong> make this automatic. Adding a button to move back and forth within your form is nicer, and also easier to configure <code>$('mybutton').on('click' yada yada yada...</code></li>

<p>Good luck!</p>
