<p>I think it is because <code>List</code> in Java are mutable be default, where as in Kotlin they are immutable. 
In the code you are using a Java specific utility, <code>Collectors.toList</code> which returns a Java <code>List</code>, which to Kotlin translates as a <code>MutableList</code>, so in effect you are writing the same code, just the type names are different.</p>
