<p>You're passing 20 arguments to <code>string.Format</code>, but your format placehorlders go from <code>0</code> to <code>21</code> (so presumably you need 22 arguments, or you've misindexed the thing - e.g. I don't see a <code>{15}</code> in there). Recheck your string and arguments until that formatting error is resolved.</p>

<p>And you have a syntax error in your query. The should not be a <code>,</code> before the <code>WHERE</code> keyword.</p>

<p>(And please use bind variables if they are available on whatever system/language it is you are using, and sanitize your data, otherwise bad things will happen - google for "sql injection".)</p>
