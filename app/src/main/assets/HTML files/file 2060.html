<p>It's an issue with the runtime environment of Objective-C. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#Philosophical_differences_between_Objective-C_and_C.2B.2B" rel="nofollow">While C/C++</a> compiles down into unreadable machine code, <a href="http://osmorphis.blogspot.com/2009/05/reflection-in-objective-c.html" rel="nofollow">Objective-C still maintains some human-readable attributes like method names as strings</a>. This gives Objective-C the ability to perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">reflective</a> features.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Being a reflective language without strict private methods makes Objective-C more "pythonic" in that you trust other people that use your code rather than restrict what methods they can call. Using naming conventions like double underscores is meant to hide your code from a casual client coder, but won't stop coders needing to do more serious work.</p>
