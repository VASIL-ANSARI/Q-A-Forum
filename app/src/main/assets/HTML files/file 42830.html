<p>If possible you should use ExtJS 5 as they have now added MVVM support (read more here => <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.1/whats_new/5.0/whats_new.html#New_Application_Architectures___Welcome_MVVM" rel="nofollow">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.1/whats_new/5.0/whats_new.html#New_Application_Architectures___Welcome_MVVM</a>)</p>

<p>So this would give you the two way data binding behaviour that AngularJS provides.</p>

<p>If you have to stick with using ExtJS 4 then you could listen for the store's update event and then in the listener handler call loadRecord() on your form passing in the model instance that has been updated</p>
