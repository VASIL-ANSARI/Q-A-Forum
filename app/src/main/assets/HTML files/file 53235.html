<p>You can't. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.5" rel="nofollow">The HTTP specification</a> states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Attempting to include content in a 204 response will cause many HTTP clients to malfunction. If you want to include a message with your response, you will need to use a response code other than 204.</p>
