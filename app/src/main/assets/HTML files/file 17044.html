<p>I suspect the problem is the lack of an <code>import</code> statement.</p>

<p>When <code>Client</code> was in the same package as <code>IRemote</code>, you could refer to it without needing to import it.  As soon as you moved the interface, your <code>Client</code> class no longer knew how to find it.</p>
