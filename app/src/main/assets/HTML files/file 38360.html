<p>Instead of using the jQuery Validate plugin along-side a completely separate validation routine, why don't you use the methods provided by this plugin? You can use <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method/" rel="nofollow">the <code>remote</code> method</a> to test against a server-side script or <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/" rel="nofollow">the <code>.addMethod()</code> method</a> to write a custom rule. By working within the plugin, you are guaranteed to block form submission until you get what you need (as long as JavaScript isn't bypassed or disabled).</p>

<p>You can also use the <code>onkeyup: false</code> option to only validate on focus out.</p>
