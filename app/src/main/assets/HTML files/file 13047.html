<p>I've seen the same issue on my Xperia Arc S (Note! Non-ICS) during development of my app. I'm almost certain that we see the same symptom of two different problems, though.</p>

<p>In my case I was reading the entire stream as a UTF8 <code>String</code> but the server side implementation was expecting me to read the first byte as a numeric <code>byte</code> and the rest of it as UTF8 <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure on the details for why I <em>really</em> got an <code>EOFException</code>, but reading the stream, paying attention to the types in the custom protocol in it, solved my problem.</p>
