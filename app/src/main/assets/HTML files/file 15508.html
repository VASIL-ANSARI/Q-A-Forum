<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API" rel="nofollow">Unofficial Google Music API</a> for Python. There is also <a href="https://github.com/Byteopia/GoogleMusicAPI.NET" rel="nofollow">C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkiddo/gmusic.api" rel="nofollow">Java</a> ports of the unofficial python api. However, as far as I know there is no official Google Music API.</p>

<p>At the moment there doesn't seem to be a way to make a Google Music app just on the client side.</p>
