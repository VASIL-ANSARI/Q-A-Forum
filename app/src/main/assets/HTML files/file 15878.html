<p>Queue is probably the best solution if the job is long running and resource intensive. For example if your batch application is sending out massive emails with the each content the classic application provides, then yes Queue is the right solution. </p>

<p>Drawbacks of queue includes it introduces management overhead like you have to worry about what if the queue gets too large, how to delivery response back to the classic application etc. </p>

<p>If the batch program can process each request from the classic application quickly then I would expose the batch program as web service so the classic application can get immediate response.  </p>
