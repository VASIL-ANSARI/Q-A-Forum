<p>As i have analysed the ajax request in IE ,304 result is comming because its loading from cache.So during the second time login the request is not hitted in server.The data required is loaded from cache.So i have found a solution that before calling the ajax request you have to add </p>

<pre><code>$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
</code></pre>

<p>Now my application works fine and authentication is working properly</p>
