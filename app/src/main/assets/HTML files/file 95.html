<p>In many cases, you can take existing code and just run it on Mono, particularly if you're porting an ASP.NET application.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may require whole new sections of code to make it work. If you use System.Windows.Forms, for example, the application won't work unmodified. Likewise if you use any Windows-specific code (registry access code, for example). But I think the worst offender is UI code. That's particularly bad on Macintosh systems.</p>
