<p>Modify the table such that it has cumulative sums of probabilities:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0.405, 0.750, 0.875, 0.967, 1.0 ] 
</code></pre>

<p>Draw a uniform random from (0.0, 1.0). Search the table for the smallest entry greater than the number drawn; the index is your value. Add to total. Repeat 149 times. </p>

<p>Subtract total from 270 to get the last one.</p>
