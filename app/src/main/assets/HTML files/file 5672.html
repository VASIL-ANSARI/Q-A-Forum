<p>Is there something in Container that is needed that the Nodes don't have?  From what I see the only reason for Container is that you may be looking at Container as a launching point to get your Nodes.  If this is true then you may be able to remove Container completely and get the root Nodes by using a predicate filter with a search criteria as "parentNode is NIL".</p>

<p>The Inverse Relationship message is just a warning.  Apple's perspective is that all relationships need to have an inverse and it is worth strong consideration before going against it.  But this is only a warning and things will still run ok if you're careful.  This warning can be suppressed if you choose by going your target build settings finding the section Data Model Compiler (MOMC) - Warnings.  Then find the entry for "Suppress momc warnings on missing inverse relationships" and check the box.</p>
