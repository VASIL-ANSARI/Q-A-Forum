<p>You don't save the parameter parsed as RedCloth like that, nor would I recommend it. Parsing it into RedCloth will result in the original value being lost unless you stored the output in an alternate field, which is what I <em>would</em> recommend.</p>

<p>You can use a <code>before_save</code> in your model to parse that value and store it:</p>

<pre><code>before_save :parse_text

# your model methods go here

private

  def parse_text
    self.parsed_text = RedCloth.new(text).to_html
  end
</code></pre>

<p>When you want to render the <code>parsed_text</code> value in your view you'll have to tell Rails that it's safe by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>@object.parsed_text.html_safe
</code></pre>

<p>However, the code contained here does not account for people mixing Markdown and HTML, so be <em>very</em> careful how you use it.</p>
