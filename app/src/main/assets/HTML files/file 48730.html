<ol>
<li><p>Handle the <code>mousePressed()</code> event. Then keep a variable in your class (lets say "clickCounter") that you increment every time the event is generated.</p></li>
<li><p>Then you will need to handle the <code>mouseMoved()</code> event to know when the mouse is moving. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So now your logic in the <code>mouseMoved()</code> event can check if the variable is odd, which would indicate the mouse has just been clicked:</p>

<pre><code>if (clickCounter % 2 == 1)
{
    add your logic here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could keep a boolean variable that you toggle off/on for every mouse click.</p>
