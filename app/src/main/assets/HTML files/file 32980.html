<p>It sounds like you just want to join the related tables, and if so maybe something like this is what you are looking for:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM Users U
INNER JOIN UserClaims UC ON U.Id = UC.UserId
INNER JOIN UserLogins UL ON U.Id = UL.UserId
INNER JOIN UserRoles UR ON U.Id = UR.UserId
INNER JOIN Roles R ON R.Id = UR.RoleId
WHERE U.Name = 'name' -- or @name or whatever way you pass the variable...
</code></pre>
