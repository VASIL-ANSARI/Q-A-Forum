<p>I created a Messages Extension for the same project in the past and deleted the target while keeping the files in the project. When I re-added the Messages Extension to the project, Xcode kept running the older build of the app.
I fixed the issue with Xcode running an older version of the app by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clean All</li>
<li>Delete Messages Extension target from project</li>
<li>Backup existing Message Extension code to a directory outside the project. Then delete the Messages app group and directory from the project.</li>
<li>Delete the Messages Extension build scheme from project.</li>
<li>Delete project Derived Data directory.</li>
<li>Restart Xcode, create new Messages Extension target in project, and import saved code. </li>
</ol>
