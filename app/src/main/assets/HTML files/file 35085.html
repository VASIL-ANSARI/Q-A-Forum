<p>My guess is that you can override it with:</p>

<pre><code>Typeahead.prototype._select = function(){console.log("changed it");}
</code></pre>

<p>The underscore indicates that select is private and should not be used directly or overridden. In future releases _select may do something completely different or doesn't exist at all so your code will break.</p>
