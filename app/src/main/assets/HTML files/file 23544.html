  <p>Just wondering if there is a way were both version can share libraries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is possible share pure-Python modules between two different installations of Python, at least if they have the same minor version, you generally cannot share C extension modules like <code>MySQLdb</code>. And you <em>definitely</em> cannot use a 32-bit build of a module with a 64-bit Python.</p>

  <p>And When I tried installing again MySQLdb, it won't let me because it's already installed, but under 2.7.3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two possible problems here.</p>

<p>First, you may just be using the wrong Python to do the installation. If you use the 32-bit Python 2.7.3 to run <code>python setup.py install</code>, or the <code>easy_install</code> or <code>pip</code> from that copy of Python, it will install into your 2.7.3 site-packages. This one is easy to fixâjust use the 64-bit Python 2.7.5, or its <code>easy_install</code> or <code>pip</code>.</p>

<p>More seriously, you may have both installations pointing at the same site-packages directory and interfering with each other. This one is pretty much impossible to fix; you're not going to make it work.</p>

<hr>

<p>More generally, it's difficult to have two Python installations with the same X.Y minor version on the same machine, and you really shouldn't try to do it unless you have a very good reason to do so. A much better idea is to completely uninstall both Pythons, including their site-packages, then do a clean install of 2.7.5, then reinstall all of your libraries.</p>

<p>(Also, note that if you're using OS X 10.7 or higher, you already have a 64-bit Python 2.7.2 pre-installed by Apple, and you can't get rid of it, and it can also cause similar problems for you.)</p>
