<p>There is no standard approach to accomplish what <code>__attribute__((packed))</code> does.  The typical solution is to use <code>#ifdef</code>'s to handle different compilers.  You can find a few solutions to this approach at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1537964/visual-c-equivalent-of-gccs-attribute-packed">SO post</a> which also contains the details on the Visual C++ equivalent of <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>.  Alternatively, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Structure-Packing-Pragmas.html" rel="nofollow">GCC supports the Windows struct packing pragmas</a>, so if you are just concerned with Windows and GCC you could just use the Windows approach.</p>
