<p>Eclipse does not do runtime checking. If the handlers module does not contain an explicit definition of the SentryHandler class and imports it from another module (i.e. as a convenience) then Pydev's Parser cannot find it. I suspect this is what is happening to you however i would have to check sentry's code to confirm.</p>
