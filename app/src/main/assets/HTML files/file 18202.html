<p>Without using special hardware (and even then, it's debatable), there is no such thing as a truly random number generated by a computer.</p>

<p>That being said; your only problem is: how do you generate your seeds such that two programs will not generate the same number. Using the current time as <em>part</em> of your seed is reasonable, but as you understand, it's not enough because two programs could generate their seed at the same time... so you need to augment your seed based on something that will be unique between the programs. Possibilities include process ID (which will differ if both programs are on the same computer), hardware mac address (which will differ if both programs are on different computers), or timing how long it takes the user to perform some task (which will generally differ as long as the user is human, not automation).</p>
