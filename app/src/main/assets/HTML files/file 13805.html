<p>I'm guessing this is homework, so I'm not going to write the code. I would suggest that your Insert() function could walk the list from the head until it gets to the 'right' spot, by comparing the input string, and then doing the insert logic. That is assuming that you have to use a literal list as your data structure. If you want better insert performance on average, you could use a binary tree as your underlying structure, but that would make list traversal more complex.</p>
