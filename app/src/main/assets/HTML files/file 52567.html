<blockquote>
  <p>By default, many of the common Core Bluetooth tasksâon both the central and peripheral sideâare disabled while your app is in the background or in a suspended state. That said, you can declare your app to support the Core Bluetooth background execution modes to allow your app to be woken up from a suspended state to process certain Bluetooth-related events. Even if your app doesnât need the full range of background processing support, it can still ask to be alerted by the system when important events occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such events may be posted messages. As soon as the receiving app is woken up by the system, you can schedule a <code>UILocalNotification</code> for delivery.</p>
