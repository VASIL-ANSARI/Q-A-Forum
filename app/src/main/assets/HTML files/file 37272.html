<p>It depends on the backend or plattform. This <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/File-handling" rel="nofollow">link</a> should help, under the point <code>
File (Storage) Types</code> you can see where they are stored on the different plattforms.<br>
Also you can query the root path by using <code>Gdx.files.getLocalStoragePath();</code></p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
