<p>I'm guessing its this line you're having trouble with.</p>

<pre><code>mysqli_query($connect,"
    INSERT INTO Projects (Project, Client, LastName, DateReceived)
    VALUES ('" . $_POST["Project"] . "', '" . $_POST["Client"] . "', '" .$_POST["LastName"] . "', '" . $_POST["DateReceived"] . "');");
</code></pre>

<p>Your problem was both the post "names" (its not <code>$_POST[post_Project]</code> but just <code>$_POST["Project"]</code>) and that you just wrote them inside the <code>SQL</code> code instead of inserting them.</p>
