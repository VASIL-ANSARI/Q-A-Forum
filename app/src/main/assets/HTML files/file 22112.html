<p>Given the images you provided it is straightforward to connect them in a generic way because the images have the same width and they have transparent background, here is the idea:</p>

<p>1- You need the overlap distance between the two images, which you can calculate from either the bottom or top image</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0GEbj.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>The green line in the bottom picture should be equal to the red line in the top picture</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YozIv.png" alt="bottom image"> </p>

<p>Given that your images have transparent background you can calculate this distance easily, I will use the bottom image here. </p>

<p>The idea is to check every pixel in the last column of the bottom bitmap (i.e. width - 1) and stop once you hit a non-transparent pixel.</p>

<pre><code> private int getOverlapDistance(Bitmap bottomBitmap) {
    int height = bottomBitmap.getHeight();
    int width = bottomBitmap.getWidth();
    int distance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; height; i++) {
        if (Color.alpha(bottomBitmap.getPixel(width - 1, i)) != 0) {
            distance = (i + 1);
            break;
        }
    }
    return distance;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To connect them you can do something like (assuming you have separate <code>ImageView</code> for the top and bottom image):</p>

<pre><code>bitmap = ((BitmapDrawable) bottomImage.getDrawable()).getBitmap();
int overlapDistance = getOverlapDistance(bitmap);
bottomImage.setTop(topImage.getBottom() - overlapDistance);
</code></pre>

<p>Actually I tried this with a simple activity and it is working, here is how it look like before and after connecting the two images:</p>

<p>I just execute the above code when the button <code>connect</code> is clicked</p>
