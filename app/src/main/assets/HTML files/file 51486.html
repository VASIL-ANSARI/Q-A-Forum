<p>Trido,</p>

<p>You're question is a little vague - presumably you want to extract some data from the SOAP service, and show it on the page?</p>

<p>Your best bet would be to use PHP's SoapClient class - see <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapclient.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapclient.php</a></p>

<p>Depending on whether your service has a WSDL file or not, or what data you are trying to use, exactly how you'd do this would vary, but the basic idea is that you'd send a request using the SoapClient, which returns an object representing the return XML, which you can then output on your page as required.</p>
