<p>You are using wrong values. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIColor_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIColor/initWithRed:green:blue:alpha:" rel="nofollow">The color values have to be in range 0.0 - 1.0</a>:</p>

<pre><code>UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 0.2, green: 0.3, blue: 0.9, alpha: 1)
</code></pre>

<p>I would then recommend to use a slightly different initializer instead:</p>

<pre><code>UIColor(red: 0.5, green: 0.5, blue: 0.5, alpha: 1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>What happened previously in your code is that all values above 1.0 are treated as 1.0, therefore together forming white, which you probably did not <em>see</em> as filling anything.</p>
