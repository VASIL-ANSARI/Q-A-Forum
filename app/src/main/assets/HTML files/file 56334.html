<p>For better readability, I got a few suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Collapse all functions definitions, which can easily be achieved by 
one click in most of the popular text editors.</li>
<li>Place related methods next to each other.</li>
<li><p>Give proper names to categorise and differentiate methods, for
example.</p>

<p>def search_board_first(): pass</p>

<p>def search_deep_first(): pass</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding splitting a huge class into a Object oriented behaviour, my rule of thumb is to consider the re-usability. If functions can be reused by other classes, they should be put in separate files and make them independent(static) of other classes.</p>

<p>If the methods are tied to the class and no where else, it is better to just to enclose that method within the class itself. Think it this way, to review the code, you need to refer the class properties anyway. Logically it doesn't quite make sense to split files just for splitting. </p>
