<p>Please check in xcode following things:</p>

<p>go to targets<br>
your target -> under build Settings -> provision profiles -> release -> check if you have selected proper relase/production provision profile<br>
and under signing identity -> release-> check proper signing identity is selected  </p>

<p>repeat the same for product as well.</p>

<p>Some tips:<br>
You can also implement some analytical tool to check where your code is not behaving properly so you can track it.

<p>All the best! :)</p>
