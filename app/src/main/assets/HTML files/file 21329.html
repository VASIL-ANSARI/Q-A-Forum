<p>The ui-dialog widget will stay in the DOM as a hidden element even after the dialog is closed.
So, in order to isolate your two dialog functionalities from each other I'd suggest that you call:</p>

<pre><code>forgottenPasswordDiv.dialog("destroy")
</code></pre>

<p>in your "closeForgottenPassword" function and</p>

<pre><code>tellAFriendDiv.dialog("destroy")
</code></pre>

<p>in your "closeTellAFriend" function.</p>

<p>This will return the dialog back to its pre-init state (which is not harmful at all because you reinit it in your "open" functions.)</p>
