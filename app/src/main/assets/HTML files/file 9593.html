<p>you may, e.g., insert your second query right to SELECT clause of first one:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  t.name,
  t.score,
  (SELECT 
    COUNT(t.team_id) AS rank 
  FROM 
    team AS t 
  WHERE 
   t.score &gt; (SELECT t.score FROM team AS t WHERE t.team_id = '$id')
  ) as rank,
  COUNT(m.user_id) AS memberCount
FROM 
  team AS t, team_member AS m
WHERE 
  t.team_id = '$id' AND m.team_id = '$id'
</code></pre>
