<p>Right click on the TTF -> Get Info</p>

<p>"Full Name" is what you're looking for.</p>

<p>That's what worked for me with TTFs.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I just used a font that had a different name from the "Full Name" in Get Info.</p>

<p>For the compilation of this answer, If the quick check above doesn't work, run this code in your project:</p>

<pre><code>for (NSString *fontFamilyName in [UIFont familyNames]) {
    for (NSString *fontName in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName:fontFamilyName]) {
        NSLog(@"Family: %@    Font: %@", fontFamilyName, fontName);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And search for the correct name of the font you want to use.</p>
