<p>You can't. <code>AssetManager</code> works only with assets (<code>assets/</code> in your project).</p>

<p>Instead, you will need to wrap your access to assets in code that will conditionally use internal storage:</p>

<pre><code>if (iCanHazInternalStorage()) {
  loadFromInternalStorage();
}
else {
  loadFromAssets();
}
</code></pre>
