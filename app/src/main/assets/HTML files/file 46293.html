<p>I suspect a missing 'flush' inside your client's 'sendSystemMessage()'.
Unfortunately the <strong>constructor</strong> of ObjectInputStream attempts to read a header from the underlying stream (which is not very intuitive IMHO). So if the client fails to flush the data - the server may remain stuck on the line "in = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream())"...</p>

<p>As a side note it's usually better for a server to launch a thread per incoming client, but that's just a side remark (plus it obviously depends on requirements).</p>
