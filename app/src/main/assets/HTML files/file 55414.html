<p>See <a href="http://www.ant4eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ant4eclipse.org/</a> for a project which allows you to work inside Eclipse projects.</p>

<p>I used it for a bit some years back, and found that this is too brittle for long term usage and build scripts.  I would recommend against relying on internal Eclipse things.  They break!  Typically when mixing releases.</p>

<p>Instead I would suggest you move to Maven.  This is a bit more work, but allows you to use the whole maven infrastructure and API's to do things.  What you want to achieve here, may be possible already using a Maven plugin.</p>
