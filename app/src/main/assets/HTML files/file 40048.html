<p>If you have the power to change your schema slightly, the best thing to do would be to normalize your tables by creating a separate table mapping users to locations.  That way it becomes:</p>

<pre><code>Locations
ID     name
1       A
2       B
...

Users
ID      name (or whatever)
1       jsmith
2       jdoe

UsersLocations
ID     user_id        location_id
1       1                  1
1       2                  1
1       2                  2
</code></pre>
