<p>The problem is that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula" rel="nofollow">Heron's formula</a> holds good only when the sum of the two numbers are greater than the third. You need to check that explicitly. </p>

<p>A better way as you are using a code to do that is by using <em>Exception handling</em> </p>

<pre><code>try:
    s = sqrt(d*(d-a)*(d-b)*(d-c))
    print "a+b+c =", a, b, c
    print "Distr. =", d*2, "Area =", s
except ValueError:
    print "Please enter 3 valid sides"
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do it without <code>try</code> block you can do it as</p>

<pre><code>delta = (d*(d-a)*(d-b)*(d-c))
if delta&gt;0:
    s = sqrt(delta)
    print "a+b+c =", a, b, c
    print "Distr. =", d*2, "Area =", s
else:
    print "Please enter 3 valid sides"
</code></pre>
