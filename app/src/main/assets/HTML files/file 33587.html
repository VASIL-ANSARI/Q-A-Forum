  <p>Where these 0s come from?</p>

<p>First of all you have added 10 items in list having zero value.</p>

<p>At below lines you are replacing the value at a random index.</p>

<pre><code>Random rnd = new Random();
int hold = rnd.nextInt(10);
while(true){
    list.set(hold, list.get(hold)+1);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>You have 8 threads and 10 values in the list. Now for each thread a random number is generated just for single time it means in extreme case where a different random number is generated for each thread still you have 2 indexes in the list that is not replaced.</strong> </p>

<p>You can try it again after moving below line in <code>while</code> loop but still its not 100% sure that all the indexes are replaced. Its depends on the behavior of <code>Random</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int hold = rnd.nextInt(10);
</code></pre>
