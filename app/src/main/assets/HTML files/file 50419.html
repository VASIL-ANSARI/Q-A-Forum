<p>I think you're misreading the TotalDays value. When I run similar code I get my <code>TotalDays</code> value of <code>1.15740740740741E-05</code>. That likely makes sense, one second is probably roughly that fraction of a day.</p>

<p>The <code>Total*</code> properties represent the overall value of the <code>TimeSpan</code>, not the discrete value of each portion of the <code>TimeSpan</code>.</p>

<p><code>Days</code>, <code>Hours</code>, and <code>Minutes</code> will all be 0, but the <code>Total*</code> properties will represent the entirety of the value, even if those parts are fractional.</p>
