<p>Unless you're programming for a very memory-constrained embedded environment, I suspect you've got a recursion bug in your sort implementations that is causing stack overflow.  Changing the stack size shouldn't be necessary unless you're dealing with truly enormous (many GB) arrays.</p>

<p>Care to post some code?</p>
