<p>There is another / shorter way to do this, but I wouldn't call it more Pythonic:</p>

<pre><code>generator = gen()
directories = []
generator_wrapper = (directories.append(foo['name']) or foo 
                         for foo in generator)
</code></pre>

<p>This takes advantage of the fact that <code>append</code>, like all mutating methods in Python, always returns <code>None</code> so <code>.append(...) or foo</code> will always evaluate to <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>That way the whole dictionary is still the result of the generator expression, and you still get lazy evaluation, but the name still gets saved to the <code>directories</code> list.</p>

<p>You could also use this method in an explicit <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for foo in generator:
    yield directories.append(foo['name']) or foo
</code></pre>

<p>or even just simplify your loop a bit:</p>

<pre><code>for foo in generator:
    directories.append(foo['name'])
    yield foo
</code></pre>

<p>as there is no reason to use an <code>xrange</code> just to iterate over the generator (unless you actually want to only iterate some known number of steps in).</p>
