<p>How global do your hotkeys need to be?  Is it enough for them to be global for a X session?  In that case you should be able to open an Xlib connection and listen for the events you need.</p>

<p>Ordinarily keyboard events in X are delivered to the window that currently has the focus, and propagated up the hierarchy until they are handled.  Clearly this is not what we want.  We need to process the event before any other window can get to it.  We need to call <a href="http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/input/XGrabKey.html" rel="nofollow">XGrabKey</a> on the root window with the keycode and  modifiers of our hotkey to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I found a good example <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5419687&amp;postcount=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
