<p>I'd think this would suffice:</p>

<pre><code>= simple_form_for @link do |f|
...
  = f.text_field :local_client_time # This generates some unique ID I believe. Otherwise, define one yourself: id: &lt;your-id&gt;

# javascript
var localTime = new Date();
$('&lt;ID generated through rails for your field&gt;').val(localTime);
</code></pre>

<p>Rails will receive this additional parameter on the server side as long as it is part of the form. What you need to do is either add a parameter on your Active Record model class (for instance <code>local_client_time</code>), and then ensure that is allowed through your <em>strong parameter filter</em> (if you're using Rails 4).</p>

<p>If you have a field on your Active Record model, then <code>Link.new(params[:link]</code>) should do the trick, otherwise you need to define a method (<code>def local_client_time=</code>) on your model, which will then handle the input.</p>

<p>Surely there will be some Date management server side as well, but that shouldn't be too problematic.</p>
