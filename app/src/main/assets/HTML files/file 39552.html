<p>Using dictionary in this manner, there's not going to be an optimized (i.e. <code>O(1)</code>) way of achieving this. You can, however, just loop through, which will be <code>O(n)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var result = dictionary.Where(d =&gt; d.Key.Key_2 == 3);
</code></pre>

<p>assuming you're looking for <code>3</code>, of course.</p>
