<p>If you do </p>

<pre><code>UIImage* stretchImage = [myGradientImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:20 
                                                             topCapHeight:0];
</code></pre>

<p>The height will stretch uniformly, which will look fine if you give a high-res original image.</p>

<p>If your rounded corners are in the image, however, this will make them non-circular. To get around that, supply your gradient image without rounded corners, then do</p>

<pre><code>button.layer.cornerRadius = 4;
</code></pre>
