<p>According to the docs for <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Core/eq" rel="nofollow">eq()</a>, if you pass in an out of range value (e.g. -1) you will get back an empty jQuery object.</p>

<p>Or are you looking for the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/eq#index" rel="nofollow">:eq</a> selector?</p>

<p>On a related note, HTML id's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-name" rel="nofollow">should not start with a digit (W3C)</a> (there's also IE bugs that crop up if you try).  You should prefix them with an alpha value.</p>
