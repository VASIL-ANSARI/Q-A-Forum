<p>I would download the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" rel="nofollow">Web Developer toolbar</a> for Firefox and use it to examine the cookies. Can you see it being made locally?</p>

<p>It could also be, if 'the_value' is something falsy, it won't work. For example, if the value was '0', I think that would evaluate to false.</p>
