<p>You can just use <code>DateTime</code> classes all through out so that its easier to compare:</p>

<pre><code>$todaysDate = new DateTime();
$maxBookingDate = new DateTime('+2 weeks');
$dateEntered = DateTime::createFromFormat('d/m/Y', $_POST['Date']);
if ($dateEntered &lt; $todaysDate){
    echo "Date must be in the future";
} elseif ($dateEntered &gt; $maxBookingDate){
    echo "Date must be no more than 2 weeks in advance";
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your code:</p>

<p><code>$todaysDate</code> is a string, and you fed it inside <code>strtotime()</code> as your second parameter which is incorrect usage. The second parameter requires numeric value (timestamp).</p>

<p>Inside your if else statement, you're comparing strings. You should be comparing them as timestamps or DateTime objects instead, like the answer above.</p>
