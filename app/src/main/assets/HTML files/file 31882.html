<p>I am not sure about the first problem. But for second and third problem, I can definitely help.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You have not used <strong>Multithreading</strong> in your game. Please remember that no game in Java is possible without using it. </p></li>
<li><p>Use an IDE like <strong>Eclipse or NetBeans</strong> for easily creating JAR files. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All the best !!</p>
