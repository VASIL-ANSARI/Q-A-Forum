<p>Theoretically, yes, it can read any number of bytes up to the maximum of <code>size_t</code> (which is an <code>unsigned int</code> (roughly 4GB on a 32-bit system).  However, since your buffer will have to be allocated in a contiguous block, it is not likely to be feasible, nor advisable, to read in a large file at once (and for substantially large files, you will probably fail to create a memory buffer large enough to hold the file).  Typically, you will have a smaller buffer and loop over the file loading it into memory in chunks.</p>
