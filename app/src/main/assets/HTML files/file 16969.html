<p>A recursive solution should do nicely, though I'm certain there is an entirely different solution to the problem that doesn't require this kind of manipulation.</p>

<pre><code>def count_rec(cursum, level):
    if level == 100:
        return 1
    res = 0
    for i in xrange(0, 100-cursum, level+1):
        res += count_rec(cursum+i, level+1)
    return res

print count_rec(0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly enough, if you <em>memoize</em> this function, it will actually have a reasonable running time (such is the power of <em>dynamic programming</em>). Have fun!</p>
