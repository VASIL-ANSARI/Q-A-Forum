<p>Last year I was trying to solve the same problem, I don't have the code right now but I followed kind of the approach taken on this answer:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6150289/how-to-convert-image-into-base64-string-using-javascript">How to convert image into base64 string using javascript</a></p>

<p>Remember that localStorage has a limit of 5 MB, so if you save a lot of images in b64 you can reach that limit easily. (which was my case), so I had to move my storage to somewhere else, like a sqlite or something like that.</p>
