<p>You can set this function to be called asynchronously by adding a <code>setTimeout</code> block within the definition of <code>somefunc</code>, note that I am using the term asynchronous loosely here as this function isn't really doing any asynchronous work.  An async function would be a function that does some work that takes some time to execute, such as making a network request, aggregating its results and then reporting back to the caller to do some sort of DOM refresh or something, it normally reports back to the caller using a callback, or resolving/rejecting a promise, in the time that this long running code is running, the Event Queue is not blocked and can continue to process other actions if this was not the case then the app would be unresponsive until the long running task finished computing.</p>

<p>What you want to achieve here is not truly async as you're simply scheduling the function to run on the Event Queue in 2 seconds.</p>

<pre><code>var ns = {
    somemfunc: function (data) {
       setTimeout(function() {
            alert("hello");
       }, 2000);
    }
}

ns.somemfunc();
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>ns.somefunc()</code> is called, its now set to execute the function <code>somefunc</code> on the Event Queue in 2000ms (2 seconds).  Remember Javascript is single threaded, tasks are scheduled to run on the event queue and will be processed contiguously.  If you set the timeout to run the function after 2000ms but the jobs before it take 500ms to compute, then we actually wait 2500ms for the queue to serve that function.</p>
