<p>You are making a server or client?</p>

<p>you used nc, so i guess you are making client.</p>

<p>server is bind</p>

<p>client is connect:</p>

<p><code>c = UDPSocket.new</code></p>

<p><code>c.connect("127.0.0.1", 1111)</code></p>

<p>"address is not available" usually as the port is used.</p>

<p>or you can ping the address fisrt to check if the address can be reached</p>
