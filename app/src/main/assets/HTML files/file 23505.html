<p>a keyboard interrupt is generated only when someone hits ctrl-C or similar.</p>

<p>it sounds like your plan was to have code something like:</p>

<pre><code>from time import sleep

wage = 0
try:
    while True:
        wage = wage + hourly_rate
        sleep(60 * 60)  # an hour in seconds
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('you earned', wage)
</code></pre>

<p>and then have someone hit ctrl-C?  which would work with a try/except.  but if you want someone just to hit the return key then instead of adding things up, do some maths:</p>

<pre><code>from time import time

start = time()  # time in seconds from some arbitrary date in 1970 (it's a standard)
input('hit return to get your wage!')
end = time()
elapsed = end - start  # time that has passed in seconds between start and end
wage = hourly_rate * elapsed / (60 * 60)  # convert from hourly
print('you earned', wage)
</code></pre>

<p>the first version is a bit optimistic as it adds each hour at the start.  the second is more accurate.</p>

<p>ps congrats to your brother!</p>
