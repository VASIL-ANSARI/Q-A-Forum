<p>It depends on the sensitivity of the data you are trying to secure. If the data is very sensitive to your usecase then the complexity of the encryption method will scale accordingly. On the contrary you can use simpler techniques to secure "less-sesnsitive" data. Either way storing the IV in the row isnt the best thing to do because in case your transactions are vulnerable to SQL Injections, you risk leakage of your entire data. </p>

<p>Coming to your question, If you have highly sensitive data then you might need to use techniques like AES 256 which will be heavy in the case of key migration and other modifications. Or, you can use simple methods like a one-time-pad with a randomly generated key and store the key in a secure keystores. You can replace the key every n months and will have to decrypt/encrypt again. The only advantage you will have in this case is that OTP decryption/encryption is a way lighter process than AES decryption/encryption. </p>
