<p>As a result, <strong>without any known parent</strong>, all LayoutParams you declared on the root element of your XML tree will just get thrown away.
Without LayoutParams, the ViewGroup that eventually hosts the inflated layout is left to generate a default set for you. If you are lucky (and in many cases you are) these default parameters are the same as what you had in XML</p>
