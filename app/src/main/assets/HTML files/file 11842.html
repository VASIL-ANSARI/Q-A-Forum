<p>This is a slightly "outside-the-scope-of-your-question" answer, but it may be better to look at a free scraping utility that already handles XSS and RDBMS storage. Check out WSO2's mashup server.</p>

<p>It uses X-family (XPath, XSLT, XML) acquisition and formatting and Javascript for any business logic. You can save the results to a DB or expose them as a web-service. Pretty flexible Java-based solution. Just need a JVM to run.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
