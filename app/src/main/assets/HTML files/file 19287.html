<p>I think you have to find soap extension file and change your <code>extension_dir</code> with location dir of soap's <code>.so</code> file. Try to find it with <strong><code>locate soap</code></strong>. Also, may be you can point to your <code>.so</code> file like this and do not change <code>extension_dir</code>:</p>

<pre><code>extension=/whateverlocation/soap.so
</code></pre>
