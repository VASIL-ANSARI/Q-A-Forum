<p>Validating while the form is filled (when the cursor leaves a field) makes more sense since you can add some hints to user. Like, if a user enters an email, you check if it contains <code>@</code> and it doesn't, it's much more user-friendly to notify them that something's wrong with their email input (in contrast, they may send the form, you validate it then and tell them the form is not ok, but then they have to fill the form again, which is sort of frustrating).</p>

<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" onblur="alert('out!');" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This fires when the input loses focus. Now, you may wonder how to use functions defined elsewhere in such handling. That can be done, for instance, like this:</p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong></p>

<pre><code>window.myHandler = function(input,event) { ... };
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" onblur="window.myHandler(input,event);" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in HTML <code>onblur</code> attribute <code>event</code> is a "pre-defined" variable that contains the Event object "instance", but for elder versions of IE, you should use</p>

<pre><code>window.myHandler = function(input,event) {
    event = event || window.event; // elder IE store the Event object in window.event
    // input is your DOM element. You can use input.value to get the value
    // or this.classList to add some class which indicates (via CSS) that the input is wrong
    ... 
};
</code></pre>
