<p>What you are trying to do is probably an <strong>AJAX</strong> query.</p>

<p>This will "activate" your code while the page will need no reloading.</p>

<p>You can use GET method for reads or POST if your job file performs changes in DB or filesystem, etc, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/46585/when-do-you-use-post-and-when-do-you-use-get">like so</a>.</p>

<p>It is very common to use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery for AJAX</a>, but if you want to do it with bare JS you can check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8567114/how-to-make-an-ajax-call-without-jquery">this question.</a></p>
