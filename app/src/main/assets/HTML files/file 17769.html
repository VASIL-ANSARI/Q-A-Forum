<p>In respect to the jvm part of your question:</p>

<p>Each java program would normally run on its own jvm process, you should therefore monitor them independently. To monitor memory usage in any jvm you basically need to monitor garbage collection statistics. To achieve this you need to add the following command line arguments on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>-XX:+PrintGCDetails
</code></pre>

<p>This will output information of garbage collection.</p>

<pre><code>-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
</code></pre>

<p>This will include time stamps in the garbage collection output.</p>

<p>You also might want to redirect the gc output to a file using:</p>

<pre><code>-Xloggc:file
</code></pre>

<p>Where file is the file where gc output will be logged. You could then transmit and process this file in order to extract useful information concerning your program's behaviour. Based on that information you may tune your application in respect to memory usage.</p>

<p>If you need to monitor the jvm process for <strong>short</strong> periods of time (i.e. for problem investigation and resolution) then another option is attaching a profiler such as NetBeans. This will provide you much more information than the gc output, however this option can only be used for short periods of time since profilers degrade the performance of the jvm process.</p>

<p>Now regarding the OS and system level statistics, i'n not a LynxOS expert, however i have used a couple of popular tools such as <strong>ganglia</strong> and <strong>nagios</strong> in linux systems which do an excellent job in gathering statistics. I'm not certain however if they can be used on the LynxOS.</p>
