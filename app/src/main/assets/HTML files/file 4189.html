<p>Turns out to have a simple answer.  The string contained \r characters that python was not happy swallowing.  The answer came as I was trying to figure out how to make a file like object to read the string from.  The solution is:</p>

<pre><code>def do_py_validate(field, value):
    exec field.py_validation.replace('\r', '')
</code></pre>

<p>This was almost as much fun as programming in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29">Whitespace</a>.</p>
