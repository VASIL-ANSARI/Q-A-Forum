<p>Maybe following helps. You can use codecs to save the XML string while using utf-8. </p>

<pre><code>import codecs


def save_xml_string(path, xml_string):
    """
    Writes the given string to the file associated with the given path.
    :param path: 
        Path to the file to write to.
    :param xml_string: 
        The string to be written
    :return: 
        nothing
    """
    output_file = codecs.open(path, "w", "utf-8")
    output_file.write(xml_string)
    output_file.close()
</code></pre>
