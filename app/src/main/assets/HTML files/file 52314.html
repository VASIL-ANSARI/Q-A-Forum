<p>Just an idea to get you started:</p>

<p>In Button3D you nead a reference to the OnMyTouchListener (probably a List).<br>
In Button3D.addMyTouchListener you only add the Object to the List.  </p>

<p>Now the tricky part:<br>
- when you click on the Button, you save the System.currentNanos()<br>
- when you release the Button, you calculate the elapsed time and compare it   to your two values. It it is between, fire the onMyTouch for all Listener.  </p>
