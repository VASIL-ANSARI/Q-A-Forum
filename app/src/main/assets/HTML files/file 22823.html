<p>I just got the solution:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    InputStream is = new Object(){}.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/myfile.txt");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("Something went wrong");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, if the File "myfile.txt" is located into the source Folder (<code>src</code>) of my Eclipse project. I forgot the leading slash before...</p>

<p>Thanks all for help!</p>
