<p>A simple way is to set a flag in the session (or the user object itself) when the user is authenticated. You don't have to do anything with cookies - let the container manage maintaining your session using the cookie. You just concern yourself with the session itself.</p>

<p>To be more efficient, you code optimize your code to not create a session until the user is logged in. But then you may not be able to store other information (such as shopping-cart contents) of a user that has not been logged in. The small memory savings is not worth the extra hassle.</p>

<p>I would suggest using a framework - JAAS is too abstract/complicated. Use something like <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Shiro</a></p>
