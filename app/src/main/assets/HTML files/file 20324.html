<p>Your site is relatively heavy (1.03 MB). Make sure all of your Javascript is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow">minified</a>, all of your images are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression" rel="nofollow">compressed</a>, and that you're only loading things you absolutely need for the website.</p>

<p>Another thing you may want to try is putting your images into a <a href="http://www.codeandweb.com/what-is-a-sprite-sheet" rel="nofollow">spritesheet</a> and selectively loading them from it. Using a spritesheet would load many of the images in one request, thus cutting down the time waiting for a response from the server.</p>

<p>From a quick look in the Network tab of the Chrome Developer Tools, these appear to be taking the longest to load:</p>
