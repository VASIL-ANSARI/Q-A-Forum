<p>I think may be you are doing this hard way with more than one search text to handle. But i just put a plunkr to demonstrate a way to do this, but my idea might get out of hand in the case the number of parameters get out of bandwidth</p>

<p>Basically what i do is set states on which filters need to be applied</p>

<p>When the query text changes you need to apply the filters compounding the conditions using AND condition</p>

<p>Basic Setup of checkboxes goes with below</p>

<pre><code>  $scope.shouldSearchWithFName = false;
  $scope.shouldSearchWithLName = false;
  $scope.searchText = "";
</code></pre>
