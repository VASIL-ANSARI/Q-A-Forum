<p>If you are looking for performance, I tested a few hash keys, and 
I recommend <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html" rel="nofollow">Bob Jenkin's hash function</a>. It is both crazy fast
to compute and will give as few collisions as the cryptographic
hash you used until now.</p>

<p>I don't know C# at all, and I don't know if it can link with C, but
here is <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c" rel="nofollow">its implementation in C</a>.</p>
