<p>So, regarding to your comment there are two possibilities:</p>

<p><em>the first one</em> is that you fill that Bitmap ArrayList with Bitmaps which overloads your memory and causes that trouble. </p>

<p><em>the second one</em> is that may be parse.com doesn't accept <code>ArrayLists</code> at all or doesn't accept <code>ArrayList&lt;Bitmap&gt;</code> as it doesn't include it in the examples of accepted Objects in the documentation, 
when taking a look at parse.com <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android/api/com/parse/ParseObject.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> you will find that put method doesn't accept <code>ArrayLists</code> as a <code>value</code> </p>

<pre><code>public void put(String key,
                Object value)
</code></pre>

<p>Add a key-value pair to this object. It is recommended to name keys in partialCamelCaseLikeThis.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<p><strong>key</strong> - Keys must be alphanumerical plus underscore, and start with a letter.</p>

<p><strong>value</strong> - Values may be numerical, String, JSONObject, JSONArray, JSONObject.NULL, or other ParseObjects. value may not be null.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>you can add it as an <code>Array&lt;String&gt;</code> that contains a Strings of converted <code>Bitmaps</code>, <a href="http://androidtrainningcenter.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-to-convert-string-to-bitmap-and.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> is how to convert a Bitmap to a String and vice-Versa  </p>

<p>and if it doesn't accept <code>ArrayLists</code> at all you can put each <code>Bitmap</code> as a <code>String</code> individually </p>
