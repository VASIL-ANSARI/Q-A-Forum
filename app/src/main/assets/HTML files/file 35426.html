<p>This is how you would do this in java, but you may be looking for a different language. PHP or JavaScript is what you want if you want to do it on a website.</p>

<pre><code>public static void displaySite() {
     Random random = new Random();
     boolean[] passed = {false, false, false};
     String[] websites = new String[];
     //intialize website urls here


     while(true) { //Will have to use a break statement
         int website = random.nextInt(2);
         if (passed[website] == false) { //This website has not yet been shown
             System.out.println(websites[website]);
             passed[website] = true;
         }
     //Do input and possible break statement here.
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just call that method every time you want to display the random sites. But every time you call it, all three websites could show again.</p>
