<p>I've never been much for being too obsessive about details of UML myself (I've definitely seen design meetings that descended into discussions of the finer points of UML rather than about the design itself), but a few minor points:</p>

<ul>
<li>You usually wouldn't want to include private variables, methods, etc. on a class diagram because that's an implementation detail (not a design detail). <strong>Edit:</strong> This point probably depends somewhat on the purpose of your diagram - some people would argue that it's acceptable to include those under certain circumstances (e.g. if your primary purpose is to communicate your implementation rather than your design).</li>
<li>A few of these methods (e.g. <code>double getK()</code>) are missing access modifiers. While it's technically syntactically legal to rely on the defaults, it's always better to be explicit about your intent.</li>
</ul>
