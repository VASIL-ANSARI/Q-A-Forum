<p>You can't store the different types.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> store dynamic instances by polymorphic reference (std::reference_wrapper) or (smart) pointer, iff your classes share a common base.</p>

<p>Otherwise you should use static polymorphism. You could look at <code>boost::variant&lt;GLSurface&lt;float&gt;, GLSurface&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code> for example.</p>

<p>To operate on these uniformly, you will end up doing something that's a hybrid between static and runtime polymorphism: type erase.</p>

<p>With the type erasure technique you basically bring (unrelated) types under a shared <em>ad-hoc interface</em>.</p>
