<p>I've tested it on my Chrome browser and it seems ok. I'm pretty sure your problem lies with the following CSS</p>

<pre><code>.page-wrap {
   min-height: 100%;
   /* equal to footer height */
   margin-bottom: -142px;
}

.page-wrap:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the content attribute and also remove the margin-bottom: -142px; from your page-wrap class. This seemed to be all ok for me.</p>
