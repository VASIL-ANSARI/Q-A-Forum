<p>All you need is one query with an instance of your base table and two instances of your conversion table, one joined on <code>base.amountCurrency = rate.currency</code> and the other joined on <code>base.destinationCurrency = rate.currency</code>.  If you need to add <code>conversion_date</code> criteria in, you can do that, too, if you have multiple rates for each currency over time and you want the most recent one, or whichever.</p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>select
  b.*,
  a.rate as rate_amount,
  d.rate as rate_destination,
  amount * a.rate / d.rate as amtInDestCurrency
from
  base b inner join 
  rate a on
  b.amountcurrency = a.currency and
  b.conversion_date = a.conversion_date inner join
  rate d on 
  b.destinationCurrency = d.currency and
  b.conversion_date = d.conversion_date
</code></pre>
