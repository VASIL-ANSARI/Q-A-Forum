<p>There is no way to pin tables in memory in SQL Server 2005. If SQL Server is dropping the tables from memory, it's because there is memory pressure from other parts of the system. Since your database is only 6GB, the database should stay in memory... provided that there are no other databases on the server.</p>

<p>There are a few things you can do to try to keep data in memory, though. Depending on the patch level and edition of your SQL Server installation, you might be able to make use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190730%28v=SQL.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">lock pages in memory</a> functionality to ensure that SQL Server's memory never gets paged out.</p>

<p>You can also change the memory allocation on the server to be a fixed size. Unless there's something else on your database server, you can set SQL Server's min and max memory to the same value. This won't necessarily prevent this from happening in the future (it's a function of how SQL Server is supposed to work) but it certainly won't hurt to set your SQL Server to use a fixed amount of memory (if you have no other memory concerns).</p>
