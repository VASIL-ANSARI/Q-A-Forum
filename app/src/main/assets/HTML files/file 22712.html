<p>Here is how you can get the wanted output:</p>

   <pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from lxml import etree

doc = etree.parse('thisxmlfile.xml')

# There is only one "season" element
season = doc.find('season').get('season')     

# XPath query relative to root node
for conference in doc.xpath('conference'):
    # XPath query relative to "conference" node     
    for team in conference.xpath('division/team'):     
        print season, conference.get('label'),
        print team.get('city'), team.get('name'), team.get('alias')
</code></pre>
