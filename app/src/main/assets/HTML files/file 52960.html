<p>This method use fuzzy set theory and may work only for 80%. It's not that bad, because any fuzzy algorithm supposes outliers in datasets.</p>

<p>Your examples can be described as</p>

<p><code>LANG1</code> + <code>separator</code> + <code>LANG2</code> + <code>separator</code></p>

<p>where </p>

<p><code>LANG</code> = <code>NAME</code> + <code>adjective</code> or <code>adjective</code> + <code>NAME</code></p>

<p><code>separator</code> = <code>,</code> <code>;</code> <code>.</code> or even may be virtual. </p>

<p>To parse <code>NAME</code> and <code>adjective</code> you have to use approximate string matching. </p>

<p>My observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>LANG1</code> is better than <code>LANG2</code></li>
<li><code>LANG</code> may contain an adjective</li>
<li>some adjectives may break observation 1. (I think it can be checked by several "if" statement)</li>
<li>some adjectives can be used to estimate the level of knowledge</li>
<li>In case when <code>separator</code> between <code>LANG1</code> and <code>LANG2</code> is virtual we can add <code>;</code> right after the moment when <code>NAME1</code> get <code>adjective1</code> or right before the moment when <code>NAME2</code> is found</li>
</ol>

<p>To get an estimation of knowledge level you have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Estimate top100 eng adjectives by hand using values from <code>[0;1]</code> - this process called fuzzification of linguistic variables</li>
<li>Find an appropriate categories ("good", "bad", "pre-intermediate", "native", etc.) and membership functions to distinguish those estimations into understandable linguistic forms - this process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defuzzification" rel="nofollow">defuzzification</a></li>
<li>Apply all possible rules (in terms of step 2.) that you can use to estimate the knowledge as <code>1,2,3,4,5</code></li>
<li>Defuzzify (mb it's better to say "aggregate") the result of step 3 into integer <code>1,2,3,4,5</code> for english and german languages (separately)</li>
</ol>

<p>In case you have some additional information about users that may help on step 3 (just as I did it in observation 1) - I think you should find some more observations because the estimation with adjactives is rather subjective. For example, if the age of your users is under 14 - there is no chance to find "advanced" speaker I think, but if your site is called "German for youngsters" - he still may get "5".</p>

<p>PS In case you'll get any positive results it may be a good material for academic publication!))</p>
