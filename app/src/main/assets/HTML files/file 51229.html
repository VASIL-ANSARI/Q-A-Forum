<p>in many common cases the ultimate result seems the same, but the process and behavior is different, and can be visible in corner cases:</p>

<p><code>heappushpop()</code> is equivalent to pushing first, then popping, meaning, amongst other things, that your heap size might change in the process (and that, for example, if your heap is empty you'll get back the element you pushed).</p>

<p><code>heapreplace()</code> is equivalent to popping first, then pushing, with the additional restriction of guaranteeing that your heap size won't change in the process. this means you'll get an error on an empty heap, amongst other interesting corner behaviour.</p>
