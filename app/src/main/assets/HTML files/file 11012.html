<p>Well, the specific problem here is that you're binding the TextBlock to an Item and not the ItemStatus. But you're also doing things the hard way, you really should do the binding details in XAML. Expose a collection of ItemStatus's from your view model, and have a ListBox or something with its ItemsSource bound to the collection. Then you'll need a DataTemplate which defines the TextBlock and the bindings to the ItemStatus.</p>
