<p>No, it's not possible. But technically it would be possible to add this feature to the bake shell, you're welcome to implement it! Using reflections and some preg_replace should do it.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to write a bash script using git, that does a diff and then does a merge more or less automatically for you. </p>

<p>However, I don't understand your issue, adding additional associations is not really hard and complicated work.</p>
