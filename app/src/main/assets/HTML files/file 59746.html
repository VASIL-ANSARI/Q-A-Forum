<p>Module name does not influence a name that your app is published with. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5443304/how-to-change-an-android-apps-name">here</a> how to do so (you need to change <code>label</code> in your manifest). By default, module name influences such internal things as a folder name or an APK file name generated by Android Studio. </p>

<p>Although you don't need to change <code>app</code> to match your application name in any way, you may want to give your project's modules some logical names that just make sense. To do so, use Refactor -> Rename feature of Android Studio (available on right click on module name). See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26936812/renaming-modules-in-android-studio">here</a> for more information.  </p>
