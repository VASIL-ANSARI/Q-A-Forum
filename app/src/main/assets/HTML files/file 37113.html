<p>To create a database from you'r Java app, you need a user with database creation grants.  I'm not sure to understand the issue, but simply don't give that username/pass to anyone.  This will prevent them to access you'r database.  Also, you could crypt/hash the password in the connection string in you'r java app.</p>
