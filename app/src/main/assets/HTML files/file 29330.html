<p>You don't need to write a plug-in, <a href="http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/attrib.html" rel="nofollow">the built-in attr module</a> is designed for this purpose. It does not depend on your file hierarchy, however.  Instead, you mark individual tests as unit, functional, or integration.  This would look like:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from nose.plugins import attrib

@attrib.attr("functional")
class FunctionalTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>To run only the functional tests, you would then do:</p>

<pre><code>nosetests -a functional
</code></pre>

<p>If I were creating this test layout, I would probably have 3 unittest.TestCase subclasses, already marked with "unit", "functional", and "integration".  New tests could easily inherit the proper test type.</p>
