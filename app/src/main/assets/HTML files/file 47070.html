<p>I'm guessing Python 2 nltk has some issues with non-ASCII paths. Using Python 3 is probably the simplest fix here, at least assuming you don't have too much code that doesn't work in it. It's hard to say for sure, since you didn't include the full traceback, but likely nltk would have to be patched to fix this for Python 2. Otherwise, you would need to avoid paths with non-ASCII characters (meaning avoiding your user directory or changing your username). </p>
