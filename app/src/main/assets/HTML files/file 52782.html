<p>Ok, found your problem after re-reading the code: Any property you want to be serialized must be public.</p>

<p>Your "list" on ListManager is private, so it will not be serialized and there will be nothing.</p>

<p>Make it public and it will work.</p>

<p>Also any other private property/field you want to serialize must be public.</p>
