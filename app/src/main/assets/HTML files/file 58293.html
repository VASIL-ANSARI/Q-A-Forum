<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/issues/463" rel="nofollow">github issue</a> for this. The problem is that whenever someone disconnects socket.io doesn't delete ( splice ) from the array, but simply sets the value to "null"</p>

<p>It's a mind buzz, why the people behind socket.io have left the things like that, but it is better explain in the github issue, which I posted as a link!</p>
