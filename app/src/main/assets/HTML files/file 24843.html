<p>I would also recommend the same,Let your android device connect to an appserver or some middle ware and let the appserver perform the dbconnections rather.Even if your android device is connecting to local server, then connect locally to your midleware local server and your middleware will respond with your Firbird query results to your android devise via standard data transfer methods(JSON,SOAP or any method that you fancy).</p>
