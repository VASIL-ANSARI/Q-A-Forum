<p>It's because the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6tf1f0bc.aspx">Sort</a> method is a static method defined on the Array class so you need to call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Array.Sort(yourArray);
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need an instance of the class to call a static method. You directly call it on the class name. In OOP there's no notion of inheritance for static methods.</p>
