<p>I don't believe you can, unless you know the windows' names, which I'm guessing you don't. (If you know their names, you can use <code>window.open("", "name")</code> to get a reference to them.)</p>

<p>The better option is, of course, to remember the reference returned from <code>window.open</code> in the first place&nbsp;&mdash; but you know that. :-)</p>
