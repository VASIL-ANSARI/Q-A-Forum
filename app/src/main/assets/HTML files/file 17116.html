<p>I'm guessing that <code>backgroundImage</code> is a <code>UIImageView</code> which is a subview of your controller's view, set in the xib to be the full size of the view.  When your app runs on an iPhone 5, it will automatically set the size of the view for you, but it won't resize the subviews unless you set an autoresizing mask.  See my answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12405392/ios-ipad-application-bottom-strange-white-area/12405540#12405540">this question</a> for how to do that.</p>
