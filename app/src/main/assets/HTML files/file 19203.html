<p>It appears that FF leaves some dirt behind, but you can clean it up by adding:</p>

<pre><code>if (!$.trim(el.text())) {
    el.empty();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will check if the innerText of the contenteditable only contains spaces or newlines/breaks. If it does, just empty it. Seems to work in my test: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cBZ7k/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/cBZ7k/</a></p>

<p><strong>Side note</strong>: you should probably use <code>keydown</code> instead of <code>keypress</code> for webkit support. Also, <code>e.which</code> is enough to get the keyCode, jQuery normalizes this event property for you.</p>
