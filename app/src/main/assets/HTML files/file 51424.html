<p>Take into account that you access_token is only valid for shor time. SO after that time, the access token must be refreshed, using the refresh_toke, grant_type. Check here the details: <a href="https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel/wiki/Implementing-an-Authorization-Server-with-the-Refresh-Token-Grant" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel/wiki/Implementing-an-Authorization-Server-with-the-Refresh-Token-Grant</a></p>

<p>Alternatively you can increase the time for the access_token. Just go to config/oauth.php and change the ttl index (normally is 3600 -> 1 hour), please take into account that one access_token must have shor time for security reasons, so dot increase too much the ttl.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>It is importan to check that you are using the oauth middleware in the controller method or during the request, because this middleware stablish the access_token value during the whole request.
Just add this in the constructor of your controller.</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct()
{
    $this-&gt;middleware('oauth');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Bets wishes.</p>
