<p>You've created object and defined method <code>class</code> for this object. And then in this method you're calling the same method <code>class</code> - you've got infinite recursion.</p>

<p>That's why you should avoid using system-depended keywords when you're defining your own methods, in your example it can be like this:</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; c
  def klass
    "my class is #{self.class}"
  end
end
</code></pre>
