<p>Replace:</p>

<pre><code>cell.style.backgroundColor="red";
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>e.target.style.backgroundColor="red";
</code></pre>

<p>This will set the background for whatever is clicked on, which will be your  elements. The alternative is to keep a two-deminsional array around of your cells ( cell[row][column] ) that you can get the proper cell from using your indexes.</p>
