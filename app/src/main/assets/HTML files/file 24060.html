<p>When you update the <code>window.location</code> the browser will attempt to request the new URL that you've now set it to. </p>

<p>If you want to update the URL <em>without</em> the page being reloaded, you've got two options, either just update the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.location" rel="nofollow"><code>hash</code></a> (which is a part that can be added to the end of the URL and is preceded by a <code>#</code> character) which doesn't result in a page load and isn't sent to the server. Or you could look into using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history" rel="nofollow">HTML5 pushState API</a> which is only supported by newer browsers but offers more flexibility.</p>
