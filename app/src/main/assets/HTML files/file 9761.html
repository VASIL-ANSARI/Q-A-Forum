<p>You can specify whether you want to sort in ascending or descending order for each search field.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `db` ORDER BY `likesCount` DESC, `commentsCount` DESC
</code></pre>

<p>With that said, you won't be able to select the most like and most commented ones at the same time. You'll have to come up with a formula to figure that out. For instance, the example below find the maximum value for a given "id" between the number of likes and comments:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `db` GROUP BY `id` ORDER BY GREATEST(`likesCount`, `commentsCount`) DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Another alternative would be to add them together:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `db` ORDER BY `likesCount` + `commentsCount` DESC
</code></pre>
