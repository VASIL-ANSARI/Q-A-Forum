<p>If you are saying that you are executing that block of code several times, and expecting that you will get several alarms, that will not work. Your <code>PendingIntent</code> needs to differ by more than the extras on the underlying <code>Intent</code>. As it stands, you are replacing existing alarms, not adding new ones.</p>

<p>Replace the <code>0</code> in your <code>getBroadcast()</code> call with <code>value</code>. If your comment is correct, and <code>value</code> is unique for each alarm, that should be sufficient to give you separate <code>PendingIntent</code> objects for each alarm.</p>
