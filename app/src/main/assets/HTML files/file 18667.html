<p>If you are saying that this is effectively looping around then $nextID must never be empty, which would be why the link was always displayed.</p>

<p>You could set a $firstID, ie</p>

<pre><code>$firstID = pages[0];
</code></pre>

<p>and then check;</p>

<pre><code>if ($firstID != $nextID ) {

   // Display link

}
</code></pre>
