<p>The nested_forms gem is a bit old. I would recommend using ryan's code in the revised episode of his screen cast (<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-revised" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-revised</a>). I think you need the pro account to see it, but it's worth it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, follow the original screen cast (<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/197-nested-model-form-part-2" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/197-nested-model-form-part-2</a>) unrevised and free and use the code from that. That way you at least know what's going on.</p>
