<p>The Dropbox API provides the /shares call ( <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/api#shares" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/api#shares</a> ) to allow you to create read-only shareable links ( <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/167" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/help/167</a> ) to any file or folder in the user's Dropbox. This call is available via the loadSharableLinkForFile: function in DBRestClient.m in the official Dropbox iOS SDK. (The Dropbox API does not currently offer any calls for read/write shared folders.)</p>
