<p>Assuming (because I have no other choice) that you're using a <code>JTable</code>, the way to disable a cell is to override the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/table/AbstractTableModel.html#isCellEditable%28int,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">AbstractTableModel</a> and override the <code>isCellEditable</code> method.  Since you want this on a whole column, just return false on every cell in that column.  </p>
