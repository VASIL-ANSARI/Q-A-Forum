<p>I suspect it's as simple as changing this:</p>

<pre><code>U_Tax_year = int.Parse(cb_tax_year.Text),
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>U_Tax_year = short.Parse(cb_tax_year.Text),
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you should check the type of the <code>U_Tax_year</code> property and make sure you parse the text appropriately so that the result of the RHS of the = sign is assignment-compatible with the property type.</p>
