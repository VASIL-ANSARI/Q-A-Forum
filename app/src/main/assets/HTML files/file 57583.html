<p>It's all about the tables that aren't shown here. There are multiple ways to delete an <code>activity</code> - and one of those ways has two paths to <code>activity</code>. For example if a <code>service</code> can result in the deletion of an <code>employee</code> (or an <code>employee</code> deletion can delete a <code>service</code>)...or some other delete path. You can only have one delete/update path to any table from a given starting table.</p>
