<p>This is covered in the AWS S3 documentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/FolderOperations.html" rel="nofollow">Working with Folders</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Amazon S3, buckets and objects are the primary resources, where objects are stored in buckets. <strong>Amazon S3 has a flat structure with no hierarchy like you would see in a typical file system</strong>. However, for the sake of organizational simplicity, <strong>the Amazon S3 console supports the folder concept as a means of grouping objects</strong>. Amazon S3 does this by using key name prefixes for objects.</p>
  
  <p>For example, you can create a folder in the console called <code>photos</code>, and store an object called <code>myphoto.jpg</code> in it.  The object is then stored with the key name <code>photos/myphoto.jpg</code>, where <code>photos/</code> is the prefix.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p><strong>You can have folders within folders</strong>, but not buckets within buckets. <strong>You can upload and copy objects directly into a folder</strong>. Folders can be created, deleted, and made public, but they cannot be renamed. Objects can be moved from one folder to another. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you can indeed upload files to S3 using a similar folder structure in your bucket:</p>

<p><code>http://{bucket}.{endpoint}.amazonaws.com/web_root/{year}/{month}/{day}/{type}_{filename_md5_hash}.jpeg</code></p>

<p>Or</p>

<p><code>http://{endpoint}.amazonaws.com/{bucket}/web_root/{year}/{month}/{day}/{type}_{filename_md5_hash}.jpeg</code></p>
