<p>The infinite loop is from the line</p>

<pre><code>low=mid+1
</code></pre>

<p>I think what you meant was</p>

<pre><code>last=mid+1
</code></pre>

<p>The error was that the case <code>list[mid]&lt;target</code> would happen, but since <code>low</code> is being changed not <code>last</code>, <code>mid</code> never changes the case will be triggered again on the next iteration.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also note that <code>mid</code> is the index of the number in the list</p>
