<p>You can strip out the tags with regular expressions.  Just make sure that your expressions will not filter tags that were actually text.  If the text had "\b" in the body of text, it would appear as \b in the RTF stream.   In other words, you would match on "\b" but not "\b".</p>

<p>You could probably take a short cut and filter out the header RTF tags.  Look for the first occurrence of "\viewkind4" in the input.  Then read ahead to the first space character.  You would remove all of the characters from the start of the text up to and including that space character.  That would strip out the RTF header information (fonts, colors, etc).</p>
