<p>After much hair pulling, I determined this was happening because it was reporting a height of 0px to the media query. Therefore width > height and it determined it must be a landscape orientation. I assumed it was a timing issue and moved a lot of code to onViewStateRestored but this changed nothing. The solution wound up being, of all things, to change the layout_height of my WebView from wrap_content to 0dp in the XML layout. This minor tweak apparently allowed it to determine a correct height at the right point and all media queries now target as expected.</p>
