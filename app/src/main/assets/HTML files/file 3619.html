<p>Do something like:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b = YourByteArrayFromDb;
string s = System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(b);
File.WriteAllText(MyFilePath, s);
</code></pre>

<p>Given that this is an ASP.Net application, you may run into permission issues writing to the file system.  Place your code in a try/catch block and provide a reasonable error message or log entry if you can't write the file.</p>

<p>If your original file was not encoded in ASCII, you will need to adjust accordingly.</p>
