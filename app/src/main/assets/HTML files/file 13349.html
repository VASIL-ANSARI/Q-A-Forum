<p>I assume you updated to rails 3.1</p>

<p>I run in same problem recently. Solution:</p>

<p>Add this line to deploy.rb</p>

<pre><code>set :normalize_asset_timestamps, false
</code></pre>

<p>In fact this question is duplication of: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3023857/capistrano-and-deployment-of-a-website-from-github">Capistrano and deployment of a website from Github</a></p>

<p>only post it because found it on google quite high and this one has not got answer</p>
