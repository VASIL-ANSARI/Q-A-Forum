<p>What you probably want to implement is displaying the specified filter on the first opening of the searching dialog. Do do this you should first specify <code>postData.filters</code> and seconds to use <code>multipleSearch:true</code> and optionally <code>multipleGroup:true</code> as the searching option:</p>

<pre><code>var myInitialFilter = {
        groupOp:'OR',
        rules: [
            {'field':'userName','op':'cn','data':''},
            {'field':'CityName','op':'cn','data':''}
        ]
    };

$('#InfView').jqGrid({
    url:url,
    colModel:[
        {label:'Player',name:'userName'},
        {label:'City',name:'CityName',align:'right',width:350}
    ],
    postData: {
        filters: myInitialFilter
    }
});

$('#InfView').navGrid('#InfViewP',{edit:false,add:false,del:false},{},{},{},
    {multipleSearch:true, top:54, left:50, caption:'Search - Overview'});
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally I would recommend you to consider to use <a href="https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid" rel="nofollow">free jqGrid</a> instead of commercial Guriddo jqGrid JS (see the current prices <a href="http://guriddo.net/?page_id=103334" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Free jqGrid is the fork of jqGrid, which I develop and which can be used completely free of charge. It's compatible to jqGrid 4.7 (which features you use currently).</p>

<p>Free jqGrid has many new features, which can be helpful in some scenarios. For example, you load the data from the server and use <code>loadonce: true</code> option. It means that the server have to return <em>sorted data</em>. Free jqGrid has new option <code>forceClientSorting: true</code>, which can be used together with <code>loadonce: true</code> option. It force <em>initial sorting on the client side</em>. If you would add <code>search: true</code> option and would specify <code>postData.filter</code>, like in the above example, then the data returned from the server will be filtered and sorted <strong>locally</strong> before the first page of the data will be displayed. The user will be still able to change the filter and to display all the data.</p>
