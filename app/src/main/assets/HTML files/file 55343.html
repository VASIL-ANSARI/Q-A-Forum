<p>I found a solution.  Using the code <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/28955/unwanted-multiple-presses-when-using-gpio-button-press-detection">here</a>, solved my problem. </p>

<p>If you're like me, and getting random duplicate button press events when using GPIO.add_event_detect, try the linked code instead.</p>
