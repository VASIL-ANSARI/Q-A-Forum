<p>I think you are after something like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = [ [(2, 3, 5), (3, 4, 6), (4, 5, 7), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 3)],
      [(4, 9, 2), (8, 8, 0), (3, 5, 1), (2, 6, 8), (2, 4, 8)],
      [(8, 7, 5), (2, 5, 1), (9, 2, 2), (4, 5, 1), (0, 1, 9)]]

for row in a:
    print(list(zip(*row)))
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives:</p>

<pre><code>[(2, 3, 4, 1, 1), (3, 4, 5, 1, 2), (5, 6, 7, 1, 3)]
[(4, 8, 3, 2, 2), (9, 8, 5, 6, 4), (2, 0, 1, 8, 8)]
[(8, 2, 9, 4, 0), (7, 5, 2, 5, 1), (5, 1, 2, 1, 9)]
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting tuples are same as in your example, but different order. I dont understand how you ordered them. If you could clarify this, I might modify the example.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
