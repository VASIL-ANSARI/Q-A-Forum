<p><strike>What is the 300 value in the addClass method ? it does not take two parameters.. just one<br>
Api reference: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/addClass/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/addClass/</a></strike>
(<em>ok,noticed the plugin</em>)</p>

<p>It works just fine for me .. all links revert back to their original image, no-matter how fast i move the mouse..</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</em></strong></p>

<p>Ok i see the problem now.. </p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome is OK (<em>the only one it seems..</em>)</li>
<li>Firefox shows the problem..</li>
<li>IE shows the problem</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Update 2</em></strong>
It seems to me that the problem is with the plugin you use.. It ignores queued requests to the same object until the current animation has finished.. So if you hover out before the first one has completed it will not return to normal..</p>

<p>I can't help more on this, sorry ..</p>
