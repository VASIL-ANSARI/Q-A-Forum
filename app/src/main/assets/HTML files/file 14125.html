<p>I think you'll find the problem if you access the page and view source when accessing directly and indirectly. Use a file diff tool to compare the two outputs. Most likely you have either not included some JavaScript in one of the versions, or the relative paths to the jquery.js library is incorrect when you access indirectly. </p>
