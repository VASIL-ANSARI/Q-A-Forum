<p>To disable this after the user has enabled your app as the home app, disable that activity with PackageManager.setComponentEnabledSetting().  Note this implies that the activity that is overriding home should not be the main activity of your app, or else upon disabling it the user won't be able to return to your app.</p>

<p>CarHome is very different -- when Android is in a different UI mode (in a car for car mode or on a desk dock for desk mode), then a different Intent will be launched when the user presses home so that they can have a different "home" in that environment.  If you are not writing a car mode home screen, you should not be using this.</p>
