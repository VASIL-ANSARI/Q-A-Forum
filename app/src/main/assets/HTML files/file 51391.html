<p>A class with a static constructor will not be marked with the <code>beforefieldinit</code> flag, which allows the runtime to initialize it at a later time (In other words, <code>MyClassWithStatic.Number</code> will be initialized when you first reference/access <code>MyClassWithStatic</code>)</p>

<p>Take a loot at <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/BeforeFieldInit.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for more information.</p>
