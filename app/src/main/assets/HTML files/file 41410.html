<p>If you want to continue when you write <code>"yes"</code> get rid of the <code>!</code> in </p>

<pre><code>while (!userRedo.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")); 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, you should probably put the entire block of code that you want to continue with in it's own do-while loop.</p>

<p>I'm only bringing this up because your second do-while loop won't output <code>Add or delete another name?</code> like your expected output would suggest.</p>
