<p>Not the most beautiful solution, but you can check if the function exists before declaring it:</p>

<pre><code>if (!function_exists('getConnection')) { 
 function getConnection() {
   ....
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that you are including a file with the same function twice (maybe even the same file?). Make sure you are using require_once and not require when including the files. </p>
