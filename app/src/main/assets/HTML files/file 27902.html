<p><code>%</code> is the C shell prompt. It's not universal for all shells. Depending on what kind of shell you're using, you could get a different kind of prompt when its waiting for your commands. For example UNIX shells commonly use the <code>$</code> sign and the Windows CMD prompt uses the current directory followed by a <code>&gt;</code> character.</p>

<p><code>vi</code> is simply a <em>shell command</em> which calls vi, a Unix-platform text editor. In your example, he's just using the text-editor vi to modify the Python script changer.py. It has nothing to do with Python other than the fact that the text editor can be used to edit Python scripts. </p>

<p><code>python -mtimeit -s</code> is using the <code>-m</code> <em>command line argument</em> to load a module and then start the interpreter with the module <code>timeit</code> pre-loaded. That way you don't have to type <code>import &lt;modulename&gt;</code> after starting the interpreter. It is also using the <code>-s</code> command line argument to specify that the user-site-packages directory should not be added to <code>sys.path</code>.</p>
