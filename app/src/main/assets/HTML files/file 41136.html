<p>It is a bad idea to use HttpContext.Current.User in a web api because it ties the API to the asp.net site - it means the api can't be used by anything other than the current browser based application. It looks like there is some further config involved in sharing forms authentication with the api. Even if it were possible I'll try find another way of retrieving the current user and passing data (the id) to the API from the client as apposed to getting the current user from within the API.</p>
