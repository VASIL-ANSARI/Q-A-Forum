  <p>Is there a way to keep a view alive while switching activities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>WebView</code> will remain a part of the original activity until such time as that activity is destroyed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or could I save the initialized view to a file to pass it as extra to the next activity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>However, you are welcome to get rid of the multiple activities, or otherwise reorganize your UI to only need the <code>WebView</code> in one activity.</p>
