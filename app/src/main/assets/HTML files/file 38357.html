<p>Matplotlib uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow"><code>strftime</code></a> for working with date formatting in ticks. <code>strftime</code> will use your computer's locale to choose the correct version of certain date formats, for instance "January" vs "Januar" for English vs German.</p>

<p>Your issue arises because your default language is Persian. Matplotlib is trying to plot using  Persian but is failing at encoding it properly (resulting in the squares).</p>

<p>Your choices to fix this are to either change the default language of your computer, or to set the <code>locale</code> of your Python code using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/locale.html" rel="nofollow"><code>locale</code></a> builtin module.</p>
