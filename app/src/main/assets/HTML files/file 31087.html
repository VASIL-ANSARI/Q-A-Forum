<p>To fix the compilation error, <code>calculateprice2()</code> doesn't return anything if none of the <code>if</code> conditions matches. You'll probably need to return some reasonable default in that case, e.g. add</p>

<pre><code>return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>at the end of the method.</p>

<p>To make it run the like you probably want, notice the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Item positions start at index 0, not 1.</p></li>
<li><p><code>onCreate()</code> is only run when creating your activity. To make the method be run when the selection is changed, have a look at <code>setOnItemSelectedListener()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
