<p>I had to rewrite nearly entirely the <a href="http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/browser/dojo/branches/1.4/dijit/_base/popup.js?rev=22888&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow">Popup.js</a> (i used dojo 1.4) class in dojo to get another type of object that uses animations to show / unshow :| </p>

<p>Apparently that's the best solution to get this kind of object with dojo...</p>
