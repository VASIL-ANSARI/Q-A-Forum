<p>If you told us what the error is, it might help us answer your question better.</p>

<p>But at any rate, this is emphatically the WRONG way to go about this. There are many serious problems with this system.</p>

<p>First of all, you're not sanitizing your inputs. Since you're mixing your data and commands together, all a user would have to do is enter a username of "x' or 1 = 1' --" to get into the system. Here's why: the only command the SQL server would get is "SELECT * FROM details WHERE USERNAME = 'x' or 1 = 1". In other words, if the username is x or 1 = 1 (which it is), then the SQL server would respond with a positive result. (The two dashes at the end of the "username" denote a comment in SQL, so everything after that in the query would be ignored).</p>

<p>A truly malicious attacker could even wreak havoc on your system by entering a username "x'--; DROP TABLES;', and your entire database would be gone. (See <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/" rel="nofollow">this comic</a> for where I got this.)</p>

<p>In fact, you shouldn't even really be using mysql_query at all. According to the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php" rel="nofollow">PHP documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would do a bit more reading on the subject if I were you. Even if this is just for practice, it's still best to get things right the first time. Look into <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php" rel="nofollow">PDO</a>: it's not too hard to learn, yet quite useful. Its main advantage is that it does not mix data and commands, so you won't have the same problem of unsanitized inputs messing up your database.</p>

<p>Also, while it's good to see that you're hashing your passwords--and you'd be amazed at how many companies that should know better do not--MD5 is no longer considered cryptographically secure.  It's relatively easy to get what's called a "hash collision," where two different plaintexts produce the same hash. Now, SHA-256 should be the minimum you use.</p>

<p>Also, on the subject of hashing, you should be adding something called salt. A salt is some kind of random text that you add to your plaintext in order to further obfuscate it. The reason for this is that there are what's called rainbow tables out there. A rainbow table is a list of pre-calculated hashes of all common passwords. If someone were to get a hold of your database, they could then compare all the passwords to rainbow tables to find their plaintexts.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to slow down brute force attacks--where an attacker tries all alphanumeric combinations until they get the password--you should also be using a loop where the hash algorithm gets re-calculated x number of times, usually between 1000 and 10000 times.  PHP's <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php" rel="nofollow">crypt</a> does this very nicely.</p>

<p>And BTW: don't feel bad. I've done all these things before, too. That's why I know that you shouldn't do them. Don't worry--you'll get there soon enough. Keep at it!</p>
