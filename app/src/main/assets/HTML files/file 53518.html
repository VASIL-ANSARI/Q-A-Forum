<p>I don't think that kind of outline is supported on Windows Phone.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26681319/windows-phone-8-1-runtime-text-outline">WP 8.1 Text-Outline question.</a>,</p>

<p>However I think it's pretty easy to do with <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D" rel="nofollow">Win2D</a> with their <code>Canvas.Geometry</code> from text. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/win2d/archive/2015/09/28/win2d-1-5-0-printing-and-text-outline-geometry.aspx" rel="nofollow">Win2D release note</a>.</p>

<p>Basically create your own control with Win2D -> Create the Text Geometry with the text with the correct properties -> Paint on canvas -> Paint your other text.</p>
