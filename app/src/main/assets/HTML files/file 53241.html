<p>If what You mean is that <code>age</code> is derived from <code>birthrate</code>, I think You should consider if You really need <code>age</code> column in Your table at all. If You are not creating data warehouse here, calculating age each time will be much saner than maintaining this column in production... Think of it - this column should be recalculated everytime someone have a birthday!</p>

<p>For convenience, You can always create view for it, like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW Employee_view AS 
  SELECT 
    e.Id,
    =&gt;here some database specyfic calculation to calculate age&lt;= as Age,
    e.Country,
    e.City,
    e.Birthrate
 FROM Employee e;
</code></pre>
