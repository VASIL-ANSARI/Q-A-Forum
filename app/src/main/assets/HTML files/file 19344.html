<p>Of course you can do it. On MVC you can do any programming that you normally would be able to do on other framework. </p>

<p>However, the paradigm of MVC pattern requires you to think in a different way of how it's usually done on more straightforward frameworks.</p>

<p>Here I'm going to tip you something. Don't use your controllers to make calculations or data manipulations. Just use a model class to do that and make your controller to call that class and use it, try to maintain your controllers as methods dedicated to distribute your program execution and data between views and model classes, letting those lasts the hard work.</p>

<p>So, of course, you can pass any data from your view to the controller, use your controller to pass this value to a model class where you made any calculation or manipulation you need on the data and save it to database.</p>
