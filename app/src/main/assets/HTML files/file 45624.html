<p>The reason why this is not happening is b/c the js file is going down, and you haven't "clicked" the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element yet, therefore your variables are still equal to 0. You have to set a function inside of that event.</p>

<pre><code>var reg_uname_done = 0;
var reg_pword1_done = 0;
var reg_pword2_done = 0;
var reg_email_done = 0;

$("#first_nav_bar li:first").click(function (event) {
    reg_uname_done = 1;
    reg_pword1_done = 1;
    reg_pword2_done = 1;
    reg_email_done = 1;

    check();
})

function check() {
    if (reg_pword1_done === 1 &amp;&amp; reg_pword2_done === 1 &amp;&amp; reg_email_done &amp;&amp; reg_uname_done) {
        console.log('its happening now');
    }
}
</code></pre>
