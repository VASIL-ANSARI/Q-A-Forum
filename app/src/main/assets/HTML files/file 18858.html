<p>There are a couple of problems with your code:</p>

<ol>
<li>You shouldn't use a <code>StringBuilder</code> to store binary data.  You need to use one of the raw byte writers.</li>
<li><code>Convert.FromBase64String</code> returns a <code>byte[]</code>, but it's not a byte array of ASCII data.  Therefore you shouldn't call <code>Encoding.ASCII.GetString</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Take a look at this other question to see how to build this POST data using the correct binary writers: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/566462/upload-files-with-httpwebrequest-multipart-form-data">Upload files with HTTPWebrequest (multipart/form-data)</a></p>
