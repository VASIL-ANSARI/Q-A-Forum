<p>I'd say just use <code>IPAddress.parse</code>, unless you do not have to separate each IP string,
for example <code>ipaddress1</code>, <code>ipaddress2</code>, <code>ipaddress3</code>, you are probably going to have to do some string manipulation, not to sure on what <code>IPAddress.parse</code> does, but if you do not have to manipulate anything then that seems the way to go.</p>
