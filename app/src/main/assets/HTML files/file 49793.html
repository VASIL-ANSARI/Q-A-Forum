<p>As far as i know, you are right, Eloquent does not cache or store the column metadata. But this does not mean that each query requires a second on which requests the information schema. The query builder just assumes that you know which column names are legal and creates and sends the query. This means, that if you select an unknown column, you'll get an exception! Finally <code>hasColumn</code> leads to an SQL query. </p>
