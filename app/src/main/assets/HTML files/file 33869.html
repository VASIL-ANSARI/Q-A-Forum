<p>All the examples I've seen are simply using the 'image recognition method'. Thus the results are not solid and sometimes there won't be anything to detect at all. That's why Eugene created augmented reality <a href="http://www.augmented-reality-games.com/" rel="nofollow">framework</a>, but you need a marker in order to use it. He did some experiments without markers, but I cannot find any of them now, sorry.</p>

<p>I've used Kinect for gestures and it works pretty well, and it has AIR sdk.. Maybe you should give it a try :)</p>
