<p>I cannot find the fault in your program so far, but:</p>

<p><em>Obviously it just simply hangs while it waits for data that never comes from the other device, but using checkpoints in multiple places we know that up until that time it is always claiming to be connected.</em></p>

<p>Actually, this means the 2 devices connect, just that your BT client app does not get the socket connected -> it connects somewhere else.</p>

<p>You can try several things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You must surround your blocking calls with try/catch, otherwise you cannot say for certain your code worked as expected. 
So surround <em>bluetoothSocket.connect();</em>  in your client code, and <em>bluetoothSocket = bluetoothServerSocket.accept();</em> in the server code. <strong>The client code should catch an IOException on bt client connection error</strong>. I think this is the best way I found to determine if client connection succeeded or not! Ofc .isConnected() could do it afterwards, as in your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your bluetooth code inside an ASyncTask, if not (even better) a service. I know you'd rather not do it, but it may save you a lot of pain. 
My BT code runs perfectly from ASyncTasks - with custom UUID, between 2 Androids, between 1 Android and 1 BT-USB dongle, 1 Android - 1 embedded device, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the UUID to SDP, and see if it works then!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One question though, <strong>have you tried transmitting something from the server side?</strong> It should work..
Let me know if any of this worked!</p>
