<p>Following happens here:</p>

<p>Let's suppose the program is started with <em>xyz.txt</em> on the command line and let's suppose the <em>xyz.txt</em> file does exist:</p>

<pre><code>if(argc != 2)
{
                                        // we don't get here because argc == 2
    printf("USAGE : %s\n",argv[0] );
    exit(1);
}
else if ((fd = open(argv[1],0)) == -1)  // the statement in the if clause will therefore
                                        // be executed, fd will be something different 
                                        // from -1 because open succeeded
{
    perror("STATUS");                   // therefore we dont ge here either
    exit(1);
}
else
{                                       // instead we get here and
    while((n = read(fd,buff,SIZE)) &gt; 0) // everything works as expected
    {
        write(1,buff,SIZE);

    }
    close(fd);
}
