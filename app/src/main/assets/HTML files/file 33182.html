<p>This is your code </p>

<p><code>customerType = vct.getValidCustomerType(sc);</code></p>

<p>You get "cannot find symbol customerType " because customerType is not declared.</p>

<p>Declare it like this, or like how you did for the rest of the variables,</p>

<pre><code>String customerType = vct.getValidCustomerType(sc);
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Infact your program is not using it thereafter!. but that is not the current issue, that is related to unused code.</p>

<p>Edit based on your comment</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but where and how do i declare it? if you scroll down to my 'while'
  code, i declared it with the code 'String customerType = sc.next();'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is in different local <strong>scope</strong>. The scope of <code>customerType</code> in  <code>String customerType = sc.next();</code> is a local scope only inside that while loop.</p>

<p>Basically your code should be like this,</p>

<pre><code>....
String customerType;
customerType = vct.getValidCustomerType(sc);

...

while (!choice.equalsIgnoreCase("n"))
{
// get the input from the user
System.out.print("  Enter customer type (C, J, R or T) or an X to Exit -&gt;   ");
customerType = sc.next();
if (customerType.equalsIgnoreCase("X"))
......
</code></pre>
