<p>I don't see why your given example wouldn't work, however you have some redundancies in your code which will create unnecessary overhead. As you are already selecting all desired elements using <code>$(".avatar")</code>, and jQuery calls like this return an array, there is no need for you to cast the result to an array and iterate over its members manually. We can call the <code>animate</code> method on all elements returned by <code>$(".avatar")</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $(".avatar").animate({height: "100px", width: "100px", left: "-=50px",top: "-=50px"}, "slow");
});
</code></pre>
