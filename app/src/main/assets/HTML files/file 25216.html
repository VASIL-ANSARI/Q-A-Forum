<p>Passwords are usually stored with a 1 way hash (for example SHA1), meaning they are encrypted and never need to be decrypted. When the user enters the password, your code would hash it and check if the hashed value matched the hashed value in the database.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like you have a requirement to also be able to decrypt the password. For that there are several asymmetric algorithms (RSA, PGP, etc) where you would have a private and public key pair. The private key is kept secret, while the public key could be shared for others to be able to encrypt their own information before sending it to you. It sounds like that is overkill since only your VB6 code needs to encrypt the data and not any 3rd parties. Therefore, you could simply use a symmetric algorithm (like Blowfish or TripleDES) where you use the same passphrase (instead of a key pair) to encrypt and decrypt the data. That passphrase could be stored in a configuration file on the server. Make sure to keep it protected from unauthorized users.</p>

<p>Have you seen this article? It uses TripleDES with a passphrase which sounds exactly like what you need.
