<p>You are using a <code>set()</code>; your file consists of only six <em>unique</em> words. Repeating the same 6 words over and over again won't make the count go up.</p>

<p>Either don't use a set (which can only hold unique values), or use other words in your file:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; words = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz']
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(words)
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(set(words))
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(words)
set(['baz', 'foo', 'bar'])
</code></pre>

<p>You are also using a <em>relative</em> filename; <code>TEST.txt</code> will be opened in the current directory; change your current directory (in your terminal, using <code>os.chdir()</code>, etc.) and a different file will be opened if there is <em>another</em> <code>TEST.txt</code> file there.</p>

<p>Use <code>print(words)</code> to see if you are still opening the right text file, check for the current directory with <code>import os; print(os.getcwd())</code>, or better still, use an absolute file path (with all the directories specified explicitly).</p>
