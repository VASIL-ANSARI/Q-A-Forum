<p>The collection initializer uses the available <code>Add</code> methods to add the items to the collection. Therefore the behaviour would be the same as using an empty constructor with calling the <code>Add</code> method.</p>

<p>Actually, the compiler will change your object initializer syntax to calls to the <code>Add</code> method.
So, <em>whether you use the object initializer is irrelevant</em>. What matters is whether you decide to use the constructor overload and the amount of items you actually add.</p>
