<p>This seems to be a Windows Game (4.0) issue. See the answer on <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/3c3ec0cb-c68c-4349-ade7-c00c5285f662/setting-picturebox-initialimage-throws-error?forum=winforms" rel="nofollow">this</a> page. You could try to set the image in your code like this:</p>

<pre><code>pictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile("path/somefile.jpg");
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/657016/winforms" rel="nofollow">this</a> page, this problem is a bug that hasn't been fixed.</p>
