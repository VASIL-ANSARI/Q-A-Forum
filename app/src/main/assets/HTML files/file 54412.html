<pre><code>counter[i] = i-1; //when i == 11, this is an off by one error

<p>An array, and by extension a vector, has range from <code>[0, size)</code>. If it has <code>nCab</code> elements, the maximum index is only <code>nCab - 1</code>. You're storing the last element outside the bounds of the vector. You should change it to:</p>

<pre><code> counter[i - 1] = i-1;
</code></pre>

<p>The missing element would have been <code>10</code>. When <code>accumulate</code> runs, that is why your sum is off by <code>10</code>.</p>
