<p>It looks like <code>bash</code> does a fork and exec to start the child process, so the child won't be killed. However, if you use <code>ksh</code> instead of <code>bash</code>, you will get a fork without the exec:</p>

<p><code>ksh -c ping 127.0.0.1 &gt; console.log</code></p>

<p>Using the <code>ksh</code>, <code>process.destroy()</code> kills both the ksh and the child process</p>

<p>I don't know for certain though, the <code>-c</code> option in the man page for both <code>ksh</code> and <code>bash</code> look quite similar.</p>
