<p>your pipeline is correct - or more specifically, your choice of elements and properties is correct.</p>

<p>the problem is most likely in another part of your code. have you set the pipeline to gst.STATE_PLAYING?</p>

<pre><code>pipeline = gst.parse_launch("filesrc location=C:\\music.wav ! decodebin ! audioconvert !  lame ! filesink location=C:\\music.mp3")
pipeline.set_state(gst.STATE_PLAYING)
</code></pre>

<p>there are numerous other common mistakes that can be made- posting your entire source code would be a great help!</p>
