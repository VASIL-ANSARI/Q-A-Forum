<p>"fully loaded" and "ready to play" are two different things.</p>

<p>To explain: <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements have three events for loading:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oncanplay</code> fires when enough of the media has loaded to at least start playing (usually the first couple of seconds)</li>
<li><code>oncanplaythrough</code> fires when enough has buffered for it to be able to play all the way through, finishing the buffering process along the way without it having to stop</li>
<li><code>onload</code> fires when the media has completely loaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted, though, that <code>oncanplay</code> is not widely supported. <code>onload</code> is the only reliable one, and it should be fine for such a short clip, but for a song or the like it is less than ideal.</p>
