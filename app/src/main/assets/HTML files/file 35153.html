<p>As per your issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The issue is: The music is supposed to start at second 89, but it
  starts from the beginning and after 1 sec. skips at 83.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line in your code <code>pygame.mixer.music.play(0,83)</code> should be </p>

<pre><code>pygame.mixer.music.play(0,89)
</code></pre>

<p>because <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html#pygame_mixer_music_play" rel="nofollow">pygame.mixer.music.play()</a> takes two parameters first one is for the looping the music and second one is the starting point of the music file. In your case the starting point should be 89 not 83, as you mentioned in your question.</p>
