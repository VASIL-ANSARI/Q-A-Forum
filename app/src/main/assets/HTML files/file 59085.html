<pre><code>int[][] multiTab = {{1,2,3,4,5,6},//[0][x]
{1,2,3,4},//[1][x]
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}};//[2][x]
</code></pre>

<p>This type of array can also be called a multidimensional array. This is a type of array that is useful if you want to get information that hangs together. Example:</p>

<p>if [0][x] is a country, [1][x] is a city and [2][x] is some other info, you can use the same var for x but change the first var to get the info that hangs together.</p>
