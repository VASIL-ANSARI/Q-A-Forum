<p>There isn't a huge difference, and it simply depends on what you want to do...</p>

<ul>
<li><code>trigger</code> will trigger an event</li>
<li><code>triggerMethod</code> will trigger an event <em>AND</em> call a corresponding method according to naming convention (see <a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.functions.md#marionettetriggermethod">https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.functions.md#marionettetriggermethod</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, if you only want to trigger an event, you'd use <code>trigger</code>. But using <code>trigger</code> you also create a "home made" triggerMethod implementation: <code>trigger</code> the event, then have a listener that will call the function you want.</p>

<p>So what about <code>triggerMethod</code> ? As mentioned above, it will trigger an event and call a method. So if your only objective is to call the method in the first place, there isn't necessarily a need for using <code>triggerMethod</code>.</p>

<p>So why would one use <code>triggerMethod</code> at all? Because it gives you "hooks" to add functionality with event listeners. In my <a href="https://leanpub.com/marionette-gentle-introduction/">book on Marionette</a>, for example, there is a <code>triggerMethod</code> call in <a href="https://github.com/davidsulc/marionette-gentle-introduction/blob/master/assets/js/apps/contacts/edit/edit_controller.js#L24">https://github.com/davidsulc/marionette-gentle-introduction/blob/master/assets/js/apps/contacts/edit/edit_controller.js#L24</a> to display error messages on a form. The same could be achieved by simply calling</p>

<pre><code>view.onFormDataInvalid(contact.validationError);
</code></pre>

<p>But as mentioned above, <code>triggerMethod</code> give us a "hook" for later use. For example, let's say I want to add logging of user errors: I can simply add a listener to my view:</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function(){
  this.on("form:data:invalid", function(validationError){
    // log error here
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This additonal functionality can be added without impacting the rest of the code, because we've used <code>triggerMethod</code> instead of a direct method call. In addition, it will be easier to test later (small tests, with single point of failure):</p>

<ul>
<li>test that "form:data:invalid" event is triggered when a user enters incorrect info</li>
<li>test that when "form:data:invalid" event is triggered, error gets logged</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
