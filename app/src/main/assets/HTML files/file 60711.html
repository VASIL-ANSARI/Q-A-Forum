<p>Have you got an App Extension in your app?
I had this error because of Cocoapods embedded frameworks inside App Extension folder.</p>

<p>You need to remove build phase <code>'[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks'</code> from Extension target.</p>

<p>I wrote such ruby script for that:</p>

<pre><code># remove.rb
require 'xcodeproj'

project_path = "Keyboard.xcodeproj"
project = Xcodeproj::Project.open(project_path)
project.targets.each do |target|
    puts target.name
    if target.name.include?("Extension")
        phase = target.shell_script_build_phases.find { |bp| bp.name == '[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks' }
        if !phase.nil?
            puts "Deleting Embed Pods Frameworks phase from #{target.name}â¦"
            target.build_phases.delete(phase)
        end
    end
end

project.save
</code></pre>

<p>In <strong>CocoaPods 1.1.0</strong> that should be fixed: <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4203" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4203</a></p>
