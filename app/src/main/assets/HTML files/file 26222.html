<p>I have encountered this problem, and I have a solution. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>Panel2.Controls.Add(Picturebox) 'This "Picks Up" the Picturebox from Panel1 and drops it on Panel2
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you have multiple picturebox's, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>For Each pctrbox in Panel1.Controls
    Panel2.Controls.Add(pctrbox)
Next
</code></pre>
