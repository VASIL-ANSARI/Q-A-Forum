<p>There isn't a perfect solution to listen the KeyCode across browsers and OS... Simply because javascript uses the same Key Codes that are reported by the Operating System where it runs.
You will be better off using the <code>input</code> event instead of <code>keyDown</code></p>

<p>According to this <a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljhxklln.php" rel="nofollow">site</a> the <code>input</code> event occurs when the text content of an element is changed through the user interface, which is what you want, because in some mobile browsers/OS events don't fire until the user enters the input and the <code>change</code> event fires. </p>
