<p>(You really should include the code that's not working - in this case the actual <code>addObject:</code> code.)</p>

<p>But I can tell you that the problem is you are likely trying to add a naked CLLocationDistance to the array, which won't work as it's not an object. It's <code>typedef</code>'d as a <code>double</code> so you need to wrap it using, e.g., <code>[NSNumber numberWithDouble:distance]</code>. </p>
