<p>You can share cookies across domains like you are trying to do, but its not straight forward, example <a href="http://www.15seconds.com/issue/971108.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another options is to set the cookie to be ".parent.com" rather than specifying the sub-domain explicitly and use the cookie store the details of the sub-domain. Then you can access the cookie from any of your sub-domains (and parent assuming its www.parent.com).</p>

<p>If your using MVC, you can pretty easily create a custom filter and add to the www.parent.com controllers to check for the existence of the cookie, and if so redirect to the sub domain the cookie specifies.
