<p>You should observe your compiler warnings, of which there should be several. This code is broken.</p>

<p>You are declaring an array of 11 characters (<code>Arr</code>), but treating it as an array of 10 strings. Strings in C  are represented as pointers to <code>char</code>. Your <code>strcpy()</code> is very likely overriting <code>Arr</code>, which is causing the value of <code>size</code> to change.</p>
