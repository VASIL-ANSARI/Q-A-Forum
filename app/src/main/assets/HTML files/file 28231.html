<p>I don't see any reason why you are positioning the elements absolutely within the box.  Get rid of that:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/qysTW/1" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/qysTW/1</a></p>

<pre><code>#alertBox_text {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  text-align: center;
}

#alertBox_div_btn_OK {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  text-align: center;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use <code>margin</code> to space them out properly.  Even the width and height shouldn't be needed unless there's something else on your greater page which this is overriding.</p>
