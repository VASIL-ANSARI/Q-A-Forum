<p>In the most cases the problem is occured by the parameters or paths. I had similar problem with assetic previously, then I managed to solve it using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to figure it out from the documentation: <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/assetic/yuicompressor.html" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/assetic/yuicompressor.html</a></li>
<li>You can find the exact parameters in vendor/symfony/assetic-bundle/Resources/config/filters</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually you have to play a bit with the assetic.java.bin or assetic.filter.yui_js.jar</p>

<p>Edit: it looks that you have forgotten to set the yui compressor path: "/path/to/java/yuicompressor-2.4.8.jar"</p>
