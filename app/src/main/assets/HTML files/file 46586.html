<p>It sounds like you're trying to replicate the example in the Square docs.  You mentioned you verified that <code>string_to_sign</code> is <code>http://www.example.com{"merchant_id":"JGHJ0343","event_type":"PAYMENT_UPDATED","entity_id":"Jq74mCczmFXk1tC10GB"}</code>, but have you verified that the environment variable <code>SIGNATURE_KEY</code> is <code>EXAMPLE_SECRET_123</code> as in the docs?</p>

<p>Your code as written with the values substituted and setting the environment variable computes the hash as given in the example: <code>DBP9woNqJpO4d4/ZFE7xveLIGPU=</code></p>
