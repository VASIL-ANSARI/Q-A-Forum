<p>I think there is a bug in the SDK that prevents the onItemClickListeners from firing when there are focusable views in the View of your items.</p>

<p>So you should try to do a setFocusable(false) on all the Views of your items.</p>

<p>The problem is described <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3414&amp;can=1&amp;q=listview&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
