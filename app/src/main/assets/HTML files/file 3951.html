<p>This is a bit like a multi-tenant application - I have gone down this route and denormalized an ID onto all those tables that require this kind of check (a tenant ID, in your case, sounds like the user id).</p>

<p>I then created an interface that contains this field only and applied it to all those classes in my model layer that required this access.</p>

<p>In my base data access (repository) class, where all the select/update/delete calls go through, I then check to see if the class if of the type of that interface, and I then check that the current access matches that ID.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, this depends on how your code is structured, and how simple/complex making this global kind of change will be...</p>
