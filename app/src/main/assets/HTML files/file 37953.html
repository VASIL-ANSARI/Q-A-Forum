<p>I JUST found a 'okay' way of achieving this.</p>

<p>I changed the output button code to this:</p>

<pre><code>CKEDITOR.instances.editor1.setMode( 'wysiwyg', function() {
            $('#output').text(editor.getData());
        } ); 
</code></pre>

<p>this essentially forces the editor to change to wyswig mode and THEN get the data. However I want to avoid this please as this could irritate users if their editor just keeps changing modes automatically!</p>
