<p>Yes, <code>PyQt</code> <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro" rel="nofollow">supports</a> <code>QtSql</code>. Note that it's not a database in itself, but rather a unified interface to database libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The QtSql module contains classes that
  integrate with open-source and
  proprietary SQL databases. It includes
  editable data models for database
  tables that can be used with GUI
  classes. It also includes an
  implementation of SQLite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you should tie it in to an existing database such as MySql. Note that Python also has its own APIs for databases available, so you'll have a choice here.</p>

<p>The license for <code>PyQt</code> is GPL.</p>

<p>As for how to learn more about it, I would suggest to first learn about databases in general and try to understand your requirements and what DB you need to fulfill them. Once you understand that, picking the Python DB binding should be easy.</p>
