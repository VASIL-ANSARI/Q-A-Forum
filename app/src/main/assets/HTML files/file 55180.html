<p>General approach to making something recursive is to think of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>When can I produce an answer trivially?</strong> - An answer to this question lets you code the base case. In your situation, you can produce the answer trivially when at least one of two lists is empty (the result would be <code>false</code>) or the initial elements of both non-empty lists are the same (the result would be <code>true</code>)</li>
<li><strong>How do I reduce the problem when the answer is non-trivial?</strong> - An answer to this question lets you decide how to make your recursive call. In your case you could, for example, remove the initial element of one of the lists before making the recursive call<sup>*</sup>, or pass <code>ListIterator&lt;Integer&gt;</code> in place of <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> for a non-destructive solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>*</sup>Of course in this case you need to take care of either adding your numbers back after the call, or make a copy of two lists before starting the recursive chain.</p>
