<p>Apparently you want to have some testability in your code (after all that's why you're going through the burden of creating an <code>ISessionWrapper</code>). </p>

<p>Both approaches have ups and downs.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the HttpContext directly</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Quicker to develop</p></li>
<li><p>Need some thoughts on testing class. Nemely the ability to emulate a HttpContext. Doable with library available on the NET.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>Using dependency injection (ISessionWrapper):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Slower to develop</p></li>
<li><p>Need to "reinvent the wheel" regarding access to the HttpContext</p></li>
<li><p>A lot more code to write and mantain</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So, I would ponder the pros and cons of both approaches and decide depending on my goals.</p>

<p>However, personally, I would choose the path that require a lot less code to write.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to Add</strong></p>

<p>In reply to the heart of the question (after a nag in from the OP) the controller should always manage the data gathering before passing them to the actuators.</p>
