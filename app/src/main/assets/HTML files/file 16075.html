<p>the long answer is my talk from a few years ago: <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/under-the-covers-of-the-google-app-engine-datastore">Under the Covers of the Google App Engine Datastore</a>. you'll also be interested in the <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html">Bigtable paper</a> and <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36971.html">Megastore paper</a>.</p>

<p>the short answer is, query filtering is implemented via both single-property and multi-property (aka composite) indices. the query planner picks one or more to scan and merge densely, ie all or almost all scanned index rows correspond to a valid result for the query. details in my talk.</p>

<p>get() is implemented as a bigtable single row lookup. it's somewhere between O(1) and O(log(n)), with small constant factors since the log(n) part usually happens entirely in memory. details in the bigtable paper.</p>
