<p>You can find tutorials on ORMs ( <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7067860/what-is-object-relational-mappingorm-in-relation-to-hibernate-and-jdbc">What is Object/relational mapping(ORM) in relation to Hibernate and JDBC?</a> ). </p>

<p>Basically, you add annotation to your Check class to tell hibernate which java fields matches which DB field, make a JPQL (it looks like SQL) request and it gets your object and maps them from DB to POJO.</p>

<p>It's a broad subject, this is a good start: <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_quick_guide.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_quick_guide.htm</a> 
It will require some configuration, but that's worth it. Here's one tutorial on annotation based configuration: <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_annotations.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_annotations.htm</a> but with less explanations on how ORM works (there's also EclipseLink as an ORM)</p>

<p>Else, you could make you're own mapper, which takes values from a <code>ResultSet</code>, and set them in your class. For a lot of reason, I would recommand using an ORM than this method (Except maybe if you have only one class that is stored in the DB, which I doubt).</p>
