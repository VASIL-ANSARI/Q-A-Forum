<p>I think what you're talking about is called a "modal" dialog.</p>

<p>There are many modal dialog plugins for jQuery.  My favorite is "simplemodal".</p>

<p>It's available here: <a href="http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/</a>
The samples are great too!</p>

<p>From the simplemodal site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a chained jQuery function, you can call the modal() function on a jQuery element and a modal dialog will be displayed using the contents of that element. For example:</p>
  
  <p>$("#element-id").modal();</p>
