<p>You're doing a lot of unnecessary work to test if it is a palindrome. Just use <code>std::equal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

bool isPal(const string&amp; testing) {
    return std::equal(testing.begin(), testing.begin() + testing.size() / 2, testing.rbegin());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will iterate from the beginning of the string to the middle and from the end of the string to the middle and compare the characters as it goes. I can't remember who showed me this, but I didn't think of it.</p>

<p>Edit: I learned it from Cubbi in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8362657/726361">another question about palindromes</a>.</p>
