<p>In here you want a stop condition.</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    mover.forward(100)
    n = mover.position()
    print(n)
    mover.left(90)
    mover.forward(5)
    mover.left(90)
    n = mover.position()
    print(n)
    mover.forward(100)
    mover.right(90)
    mover.forward(5)
    mover.right(90)
</code></pre>

<p>You can either try and use the mover's position, or you can count the number of times it must move.</p>

<p>If you use the mover's position you will have to do calculations to offset from where the square starts and what direction you're going in (especially if you're at a 30Â° angle!), so I don't recommend that.</p>

<p>Instead, you can say that the square (which is blue, btw, not red) is 75px tall and you move up by 10 each iteration, so you want 7Â½ iterations. If you had a whole number of iterations, say 8, you could've done</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(8):
    mover.forward(100)
    n = mover.position()
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>which counts the iterations 0..7 (there are 8 numbers from 0 to 7) and does an iteration each time. We want to break from the loop on the final, 8<sup>th</sup> iteration, which is easy because we have the <code>break</code> keyword and the <code>i</code> variable from the <code>range</code> keeps track of the number of iterations:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(8):
    mover.forward(100)
    n = mover.position()
    print(n)
    mover.left(90)
    mover.forward(5)
    mover.left(90)
    n = mover.position()
    print(n)

    if i == 7:
        break

    mover.forward(100)
    mover.right(90)
    mover.forward(5)
    mover.right(90)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>i == 7</code> happens on the <strong>8<sup>th</sup></strong> iteration, so the 8<sup>th</sup> is cancelled half-way, so 7Â½ iterations, moving 75 pixels upwards, are done.</p>
