<p>It appears this is an "Apple-only" feature as of now... <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/accessibility-dev/2015/Jan/msg00003.html" rel="nofollow">source</a></p>

<p>Digging through API documentation, there doesn't seem to be any identifier that can set this for you, and I therefore think it's not publicly supported yet. It's likely been reported already, but reporting this as a request to <a href="http://%20https://bugreporter.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">Apple</a> can never hurt.</p>

<p>Sorry this is probably not the answer you were hoping for! :/</p>
