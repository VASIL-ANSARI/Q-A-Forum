<p>The reason is this bit:</p>

<pre><code>@project.tasks.build
</code></pre>

<p>in your form. What it does it builds a new, non-saved Task record and stores it within association. Every further call to <code>@project.tasks</code> will return the usual results (from database) + this new record. What you need to do is to replace it with:</p>

<pre><code>@project.tasks.scope.build
</code></pre>

<p><code>scope</code> method will return new instance of the association, so it is safe to call build on it as it will not be stored anywhere and won't affect your original association object.</p>
