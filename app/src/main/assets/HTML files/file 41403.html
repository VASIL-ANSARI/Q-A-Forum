<p>accept_confirm and dismiss_confirm will only accept or dismiss the modal.</p>

<p>If you want to compare the text the you can take the return value of accept_confirm in a variable and then later you can compare it.</p>

<pre><code>message = accept_prompt(with: 'Linus Torvalds') do
  click_link('Show Prompt About Linux')
end
expect(message).to eq('Who is the chief architect of Linux?')
</code></pre>
