<p>You can approximate it but J2ME (the version of java on mobile phones) may not be the right technology to do this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>starting a MIDlet (a Java application for mobile phones) when the phone is switched on is tricky at best without coding a small Symbian OS C++ module that will start it for you. If you want to try anyway, look at the PushRegistry class in the MIDP specs
(http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/). The Content Handling API might provide some way to do it too (http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr211). When you are ready to give up, do it in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Backgrounding a MIDlet isn't hard. The phone's "menu" key will do it for you. Programatically, Canvas.setCurrent(null) has a good chance of working. Trying to trick the phone by providing a fully transparent GUI and not handling any keypad activity will absolutely not work. Creating and starting a separate Thread in the MIDlet should allow you to keep something running even after your overload of MIDlet.pauseApp() has been called by the application management system.</p></li>
<li><p>The real issue is that the MIDlet will not have any Inter Process Communication system unless you make one. The usual way of doing that is a loopback socket connection over which you transfer data. Not a nice or efficient way of simulating IPC. Sharing a RMS record can only be done from within the same MIDlet suite (you can package several MIDlets into the same .jar file), I think. The code to create a provider/consumer data flow over a file connection is even uglier and will raise security issues.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Without any more information about what you want to use it for, my answer is : maybe but you should probably not try.</p>
