<p>You should call <code>next()</code> method on the result set to "move" the iterator:</p>

<pre><code>...
ResultSet resultat = statement.executeQuery("USE albums SELECT Album.numero_artist FROM Album INNER JOIN Artist ON Album.num_artist = Artiste.num_artist where name like '"+artist+"'");    
resultat.next();           
int result = resultat.getInt(1); // Here is the problem
...
</code></pre>

<p>And if the security and better performance is important for your application, you should also consider using prepared statement. </p>
