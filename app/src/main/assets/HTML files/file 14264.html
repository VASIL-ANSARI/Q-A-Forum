<p>I don't think you can do any better than what you've got without writing lots of code. IE's proprietary <code>TextRange</code> has a <code>queryCommandState()</code> and related methods but that's never made it into Range in other browsers.</p>

<p>If you're unhappy that you need to destroy the selection to do the bold testing, then I agree that it seems unnecessarily complicated and clunky, but it is simple to restore the selection to its original state. Also, the standards-based way to empty the selection is <code>removeAllRanges()</code> rather than <code>empty()</code>, which is WebKit-specific.</p>

<p>Demo: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/GkWTb/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/GkWTb/1/</a></p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>var range = document.caretRangeFromPoint(x, y);
var sel = window.getSelection();
var selRange;

// Save initial selection
if (sel.rangeCount &gt; 0) {
    selRange = sel.getRangeAt(0);
}
range.expand("word");
sel.removeAllRanges();
sel.addRange(range);
alert( document.queryCommandState("bold") );

// Restore original selection
sel.removeAllRanges();
if (selRange) {
    selRange = sel.addRange(selRange);
}
</code></pre>
