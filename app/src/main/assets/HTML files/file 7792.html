<p>There are two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an <code>int</code>, and always keep track of monetary values in cents (or the smallest possible division of whatever currency you're using).  Use only integer calculations.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDecimalNumber_Class/Reference/Reference.html"><code>NSDecimalNumber</code></a>, which does exact decimal arithmetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution #1 requires you to convert between cents and dollars whenever you do input or output of monetary values, whereas solution #2 can be messier to code (e.g. you have to write something like <code>[num1 decimalNumberByAdding:num2]</code> instead of <code>num1 + num2</code> to add two numbers).</p>

<p>I'd recommend solution #1, but go with whichever of those you think would work best.</p>
