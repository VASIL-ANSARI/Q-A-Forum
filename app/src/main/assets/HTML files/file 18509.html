<p>korylprince is correct. You just need a return statement, or in your case pass:</p>

<pre><code>def run(self):
    if self.FLAG == True:
        pass
    else:
        print str(self.myName) + " is running."
</code></pre>

<p>Since you have no looping structure in the code, the thread is going to terminate in both cases. Basically once the function returns the thread will exit. Add a loop of some kind in there if you want do more than one operation.</p>
