<p>why do you want to do that? does the contract state they are independent? i don't think so. i'm guessing the contract says:</p>

<ol>
<li>new object is created as empty so <code>get</code> will return null / throw exception.</li>
<li>when you <code>put</code> something, you can <code>get</code> it. </li>
<li>you can not <code>get</code> what you didn't <code>put</code>.</li>
<li>when you <code>put</code> many times on same key you will <code>get</code> the latest value.</li>
</ol>

<p>and so on. you can test each of those invariants. when you use <code>Whitebox</code> you start to test implementation details, not the contract and that makes the refactoring (e.g. using faster implementation) much harder</p>
