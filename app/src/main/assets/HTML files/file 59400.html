<p>It seems like you would have that shortId stored with your review in the database.  Which should make it easy enough to do something like this in your node app:</p>

<p><code>res.render('index', {shortId: req.session.shortId, review: review});</code></p>

<p>Then on your ejs template you should be able to conditionally display the button similar to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if (shortId === review.shortId) { %&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry if the syntax is a little off here, it's been a while since I've worked with EJS.</p>
