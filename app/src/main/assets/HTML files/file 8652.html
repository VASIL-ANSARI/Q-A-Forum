<p><code>InputStream.read</code> only returns a certain amount of data, you are supposed to loop until the stream is empty. However I suggest you use commons-io's <code>org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.copyInputStreamToFile(InputStream, File)</code> to copy the streams rather than rolling your own...</p>
