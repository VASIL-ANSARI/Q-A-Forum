<p>At the time, I wasn't as adept yet with AJAX, so didn't quite understand the callback functionality. What I ended up using was something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>$('td.query-main').live('click', function() {
  var queryid = $(this).data("queryid");
  var dataString = 'term=' + queryid;
  $.ajax({  
    type: "POST",  
    url: "/snippets",  
    data: dataString,
    success: function(data) {
      $('#query-focus').html(data);
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>
