<p>Oops, don't worry.  This problem is thrown up because I did not realise that a collegue had created the same field in each joined subclass.  Hibernate will just go the the first subclass to load the property.  This why i was getting the wrong instance back.</p>

<p>Now we have renamed them, it all works fine.  Had my head scratching for a while though.</p>
