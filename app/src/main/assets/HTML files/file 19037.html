<p>It seems that you are using the <code>FROM</code> clause before <code>CASE</code> and not after:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   ProductNumber, Category =
      CASE ProductLine
         WHEN 'R' THEN 'Road'
         WHEN 'M' THEN 'Mountain'
         WHEN 'T' THEN 'Touring'
         WHEN 'S' THEN 'Other sale items'
         ELSE 'Not for sale'
      END,
   Name
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ProductNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Other thing I can think of is that you are not returning true or false with <code>CASE</code> and that might getting you an error.</p>
