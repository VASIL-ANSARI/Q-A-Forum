<p>You're getting this because you are doing math with floating-point values. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html" rel="nofollow">Read some theory about it</a>.</p>

<p>You really don't want to calculate money like that as you might get weird rounding problems that you can't really do anything to fix.</p>

<p>For PHP, there are plenty of libraries that help you evade the problem, such as <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php" rel="nofollow">BC Math</a>, or <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php" rel="nofollow">GMP</a>.</p>

<p>Other solution would be to calculate all of the values using the smallest monetary value that the currency has (like cents) so you are always using integers.</p>
