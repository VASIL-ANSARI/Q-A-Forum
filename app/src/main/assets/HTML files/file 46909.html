<p>Create a query with HQL or QueryOver. The query is based on your classes, not tables, and there is some information missing. I just used my fantasy to fill the gaps. There is a plain rewrite of your query in HQL, assuming some properties in your class model:</p>

<pre><code>    SELECT count(Matpunkt.id) AS `Count`, 
        f.ID_FÃ¶retag,
        f.Namn,
        f.Adress,
        f.Postnummer,
        f.Postadress,
        f.Tele,
        f.Orgnummer,
        f.Typ,
        f.Logo,
        f.Fax,
        f.Mallkatalog,
        f.Tidszon,
        u.Ansvarigtkontor AS `AnsvKontor`
    FROM Matpunkt m
        join m.InstrumentParameter ip
        join m.Uppdrag u
        join u.FÃ¶retag f
    WHERE ip.Ner IS NULL
    GROUP BY 
        f.ID_FÃ¶retag, 
        f.Namn, 
        f.Adress, 
        f.Postnummer, 
        f.Postadress, 
        f.Tele, 
        f.Orgnummer, 
        f.Typ, 
        f.Logo, 
        f.Fax, 
        f.Mallkatalog, 
        f.Tidszon, 
        u.Ansvarigtkontor
    ORDER BY `Count` desc
</code></pre>

<p>You get an <code>object[]</code> back, which is not very nice when working with an ORM.</p>

<p>Frankly I guess it can be simplified a lot. If I had your class model, I probably could come up with a much better solution. What actually do you want to count, from point of view of a FÃ¶retag, which seems to be the central part here?</p>

<p>You should also consider the pure object oriented approach, where you get fully initialized objects to the memory and do some processing there (only do this with a few records).</p>
