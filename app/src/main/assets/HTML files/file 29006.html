<p>1: A couple of years ago I asked the same. While in Spring you can specify that some transactions should cause rollback and some not, in blueprint you cannot do this. After a while I found the book "Clean code" and read the chapter "Error handling". And I got enlightened. I do not really try to write down the same as the book says. I think after you read it you will get some useful basic thoughts to build up your opinion if this is a right behaviour.</p>

<p>2: There can be two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>You throw the exception before the persist function. You catch the exception in the parent. The child function is only wrapped with intercepting logic if the function is called from outside of there is not rollback when the call from child goes back to parent in whatever way. Just think of class wrapping. At least if you do not use bytecode manipulation or runtime class inheritance (but only java proxy classes) you cannot write wrap a class in a way that it intercepts function calls between functions inside. Probably Aries with ASM tries to do the trick (is ASM-4 is present) but personally I do not like this kind of tricks.</li>
<li>You found a bug</li>
</ul>

<p>3: That confuses me, too :). Are you sure you do not throw the exception after persisting in the parent but before calling the child? Probably ASM is present and if that is there jta-blueprint has a bug... Debugging would be necessary to find out what happens.</p>

<p>4: Nice to hear that it can work somehow :)</p>
