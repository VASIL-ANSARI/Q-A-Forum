<p>If you don't have graphic rendering or animations maybe you have some bottlenecks in the data loading process. So actually the UI components have to wait for the data that they display and thus their drawing is delayed.
For example a simple UITableView can lag significantly if it displays cells that have images in it and the images come from a network source and they are loaded synchronously. This piece of code can provide a huge delay on bad networks</p>

<pre><code>someTableViewCell.imageView.image = [self getImageFromSomeInternetServer];
</code></pre>

<p>This is just a simple example but it's a good starting point to look for bottlenecks because you have not provided any code or info what exactly is wrong with your app.</p>

<p>Also as this guy commented your question use Instruments. One of the presets measures the execution time of your code and calculates the percentage. Use that and you can see which pieces of code are the most time consuming and need optimization.</p>
