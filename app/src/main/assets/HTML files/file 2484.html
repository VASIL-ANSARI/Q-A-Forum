<p>With out looking at your program it's impossible to say what the problem is. Are you keeping results of queries you run against the database in memory? If your program is written in such a way that you have multiple large JDBC result sets and the garbage collector can't determine weather it's safe to free the memory they use you could easily run out of memory.</p>
