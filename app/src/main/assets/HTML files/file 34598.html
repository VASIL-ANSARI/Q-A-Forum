<p>Perhaps the syntax you are looking for is <code>window.blah.blah[VARIABLE1]</code>
(assuming the blahs are objects.)</p>

<p>note that storing data on window is typically a bad idea, so for the following example, I'll move the top-level object from the global space (accessed through <code>window</code>) into a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>var myObj = {
    blah: {
        blah: {}
    }
};
var fooVar == 'foo';

function getMyDynamicVariable() {
    return "foo"; //really this would by some dynamically generated string
}

//example usage:

myObj.blah.blah[getMyDynamicVariable()];

// OR

myObj.blah.blah[fooVar];

// would be the same as

myObj.blah.blah.foo //(in this exact example, where all functions and variables contain the string 'foo'.)
</code></pre>
