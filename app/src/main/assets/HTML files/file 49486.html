<p>You can't subscript AnyObject. Have to cast it to a dictionary.
You'll also want to be sure those values are Ints.</p>

<pre><code>  firebase!.observeEventType(FEventType.Value, withBlock: { [weak self] (snapshot) in    
            if let stuff = snapshot.value as? [String:AnyObject] {
                    let from_user_id = stuff["from_user_id"] as? Int
                    let value = stuff["value"] as? Int
                }
        }
</code></pre>
