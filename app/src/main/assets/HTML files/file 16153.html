<p>You control the data that backs the UITableView datasource.  When you implement the datasource callbacks, you're retrieving data from the array or whatever data structures are that hold your data.</p>

<p>If you want the data to be "refreshed" after after retrieving data from the server then clear your data structure (array?) and replace the data.  Then you can call reload and the datasource delegate methods will query the newly replaced data.</p>
