<p>I think it can be useful to have overloaded methods that take both types of arguments.</p>

<p>For example, in some of my classes, in particular in setter methods, I have methods that take both String and int/long. The reason is that I have a mechanism to serialize an instance to XML, and when I de-serialize it, I use the setField(String) method, which converts the field to its integer/long type, so the class itself used the <code>setField(String)</code> variant. When the class is constructed from scratch, I would usually use the <code>setField(int)</code> directly.</p>

<pre><code>public void setField (String val)
{
    try {
        int v = Integer.parseInt(val);
        setField (v);
    }
    catch (..) {
        ...
    }
}

public void setField (int val)
{
    // can add some range checks here
    this.val = val;
}
</code></pre>
