<p>Read carefully the GCC <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/" rel="nofollow">install instructions</a>. GCC should not be built inside its source tree:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, we highly recommend that GCC be built into a separate directory from the sources which does not reside within the source tree. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should try again, perhaps something like:</p>

<pre><code>wget \
 http://nl.mirror.babylon.network/gcc/releases/gcc-6.1.0/gcc-6.1.0.tar.bz2 -O - \
  | tar xjvf -
mkdir Gcc6BuildTree
cd Gcc6BuildTree
../gcc-6.1.0/configure --enable-shared --disable-checking \
  --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib --program-suffix=-6
make -j4
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, try first <code>/usr/bin/gcc -v</code>; that will give you how the <em>system</em> compiler was configured &amp; built. And it is inspirational.</p>

<p>Also, I strongly recommend using <code>--program-suffix=</code> (and I would recommend configuring also the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/" rel="nofollow">GCCJIT</a>)</p>

<p>And you might try first to run <code>aptitude build-dep gcc-6</code> (or <code>gcc-5</code>) to get the useful dependencies (dependencies for GCC 6 have much in common with dependencies for GCC 5).</p>

<p>Perhaps your Ubuntu already ships with some <code>gcc-6</code>? Did you try <code>aptitude install gcc-6</code> ? See also <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/746480/64680">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-6/" rel="nofollow">GCC 6.2</a> was released a few weeks ago (in august 2016). You'll better build gcc 6.2 instead of gcc 6.1</p>

<p>Notice also that the source tarball has a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/contrib/download_prerequisites?view=markup" rel="nofollow">contrib/download_prerequisites</a> script which you might find useful.</p>

<p>NB: <code>gcc-help@gcc.gnu.org</code> might be a better place to ask your question.</p>
