<p>You're kind of on the right track potter but with a few problems. The first being that your function is named FindCell (with upper case F) and it calls a very similarly named function findCell (with lower case f) that isn't shown anywhere. </p>

<p>The script supplied doesn't show how you are getting the asset tags to work with. You probably have some function that gets it and declares the input as a variable. You need to pass that variable to the function that searches for a match. Your function above would not actually search for anything.</p>

<p>This is what I would do ( with commented statements to explain what's going on):</p>

<pre><code>function getScannedInput() { /*I'm simulating the function you probably have which gets the scanned input
  You'll have your script to get the input here*/

  var scannedInput = 1002001 //I hardcoded the number you gave just for example

  var myInfo = FindCell(scannedInput); // You need to pass the value of the scanned input to the function
                                       //returns this 2D array [[StudentName, userName, SN, cellAddress]]
  var StudentName = myInfo[0][0];
  var userName = myInfo[0][1];
  var SN = myInfo[0][2];
  var cellAddress = myInfo[0][3]; //You may not need this now.
  /*Bear in mind that if you still need to use the cellAddress you'll need to
    set variables for the ss and sheet in this function too.*/

//  * Now do stuff with StudentName, userName &amp; SN *
}

function FindCell(scannedInput) { // You need to pass the value of the scanned input to the function
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById("1W3hkCk8foL7fQtmVkcU4ZP4eTbHT696cacR6a-sSeDY");
  var sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();
  var range = sheet.getDataRange();
  var values = range.getValues();
  var myInfo = []; //Create an empty array to put your info in when found
  var found = false;
  for (var i=0; i&lt;values.length; ++i) { // Loops through each row
    for (var j=0; j&lt;values[i].length; ++j) { // Loops through each column
      if (values[i][j] == scannedInput) { // Checks for match to scannedInput
        myInfo.push(values[i][0]);//Adds StudentName to the array
        myInfo.push(values[i][1]);//Add username to the array
        myInfo.push(values[i][3]);//Adds SN to the array
        myInfo.push(sheet.getRange(i, j).getA1Notation()); /*If you still need to return the cell address - 
        Do you still need to? (I think probably not.) Delete if you don't*/
        found = true;
        break; // Breaks out of the j loop
      }
    }
    if (found) {
      break;  // Breaks out of the i loop if found is true i.e. scannedInput was found
    }
  }
  return [myInfo]; /*returns this array [StudentName, userName, SN, cellAddress]
  or [StudentName, userName, SN] if you didn't need cellAddress above.*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>Editted after OP pointed out that myInfo returns 2D array.
