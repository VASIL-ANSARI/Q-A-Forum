<p>If your environment supports <a href="http://caniuse.com/queryselector" rel="nofollow">querySelector/querySelectorAll</a>, try:</p>

<pre><code>xmldoc.querySelector("tuv[xml\\:lang='es']");
</code></pre>

<p>If not, I am afraid looping is the only way. You could of course consider using a library like jQuery that does the looping for you.</p>
