<p>Your problem is simple - you've given your input field an ID (<code>mail</code>), but <em>not</em> a <code>name</code>, and therefore the serialization isn't working - you're just sending an empty query string to the server.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id="mail" name="mail" type="text" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I always use both a name and ID because form submission requires the former, but DOM manipulation is (much) easier using the latter.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to avoid the new problem you've discovered after fixing the above, simply ensure that your script always returns some valid JSON, even if it's just <code>{}</code>.  You've asked the server for some JSON - you have to return some.</p>
