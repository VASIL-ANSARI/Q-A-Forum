<p>The second one <em>should</em> be more efficient since the first one creates two instances for each source element, and you have two select iterators going on.</p>

<p>However, whether the difference is significant or not depends on your use case. If the number of elements is small, the dto constructor is very light (which it should be), and you're not doing this millions of times in a loop, then you shouldn't see a significant difference. </p>

<p>In my opinion,  since the conversion seems to be somewhat lengthy, you should pull this conversion into a new method, use that inside a select. That way, you can maintain that conversion easier.</p>

<pre><code>MyDto GetDto( MyResult resultItem)
{
    ...
}

var dtos = results.Select(GetDto);
</code></pre>
