<p>You are not base64 encoding a Bitmap instance (as you suggest in your post and even in the subject) but a byte array <code>b</code> in <code>String imageEncoded = Base64.encodeToString(b, Base64.DEFAULT);</code>. The byte array 'b' contains the bytes of what would be the content of a .jpg file if you would write these bytes to file. </p>

<p>What you have to do is put the contents of the .jpg file which you want to upload directly in a byte array. Then encode that array.</p>

<p>Google for <code>android put file content in byte array</code>. Code has been posted many times on this site</p>
