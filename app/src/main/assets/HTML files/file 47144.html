<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davkean" rel="nofollow">David Kean</a>, a dev on the C#/VB languages team, responded quite quickly on Twitter and did some research on this. He reported back to me that this is in fact a bug and known limitation in Roslyn. After investigation, he reported the problem on Github <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4033" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4031" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are basically two problems here that together caused me to get stuck:</p>

<ol>
<li>cref's to public members become ambiguous when an internal member is also in scope. In the case of <code>Type</code>, there seems to be an internal type named <code>Type</code>, but different than the public <code>System.Type</code>. Although this internal <code>Type</code> type, doesn't exist for my code, it does exist for Roslyn, and Roslyn gets confused.</li>
<li>The error message does not include fully qualified references in CS0419 to make it less confusing. Because the error message just states "Invalid type for parameter Type in XML comment cref attribute" it became hard for me to guess what the actual problem was.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current work around for this problem is to fully qualify the types like this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;see cref="Y(System.Type)"/&gt;.&lt;/summary&gt;
public void X() { }
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The same holds for <code>Assembly</code>. You will have to fully qualify that type as <code>System.Reflection.Assembly</code>.</p>
