<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>select dte as last_day, dayofweek_abbr as original_dayofweek, 
dte - (decode(dayofweek, 7, 1, 1, 2, 0)) as last_weekday_america
from (
    select last_day(to_date(to_char(level, '09') || '2013', 'MMYYYY')) as dte,
    to_char(last_day(to_date(to_char(level, '09') || '2013', 'MMYYYY')), 'D') as dayofweek,
    to_char(last_day(to_date(to_char(level, '09') || '2013', 'MMYYYY')), 'DAY') as dayofweek_abbr
    from dual
    connect by level &lt;= 12
)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>
