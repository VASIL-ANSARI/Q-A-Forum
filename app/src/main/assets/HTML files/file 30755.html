<p>What you are seeing is the default behavior of check boxes in HTML forms. The values are only passed if the box(es) are checked.  When unchecked, then the form fields are not passed.  </p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments, the reason your <code>&lt;cfparam&gt;</code> tags are not catching this condition is because you have not scoped them.  This should fix your problem.</p>

<p>I also noticed in the comments that you said scoping did not fix the problem. That is because you also have a typo in your code (or at least a mis-match). In your <code>&lt;cfparam&gt;</code> tag for the Tuesday variable you set the name as <code>Loc_Tues</code> (notice the 's' on the end). Later in your code you are referring to <code>Loc_Tue</code> (without an 's'). So add the <code>form.</code> scope in your <code>&lt;cfparam&gt;</code> tags and fix that mis-match then you should be good to go.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Mon" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Tue" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Wed" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Thu" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Fri" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Sat" default="0"&gt;
&lt;cfparam name="form.Loc_Sun" default="0"&gt;
</code></pre>
