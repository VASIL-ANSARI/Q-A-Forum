<p>In general, using a "CSS reset" will do wonders for the consistency of your web style no matter which browsers you're interested in.  I have used the Yahoo <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/" rel="nofollow">YUI CSS reset</a> in the past, but there are many others which will also do more or less the same thing.  Your paragraphs, font sizes, paddings, margins, and much much more will work much more consistently with a CSS reset.</p>

<p>So what is it?  It's a stylesheet that sets most or all of the styles in your document to nil - it makes the document completely vanilla, but more importantly, <em>consistently</em> vanilla.  Then, all the styles you add afterwards are clean and consistent.  Try it, it's a huge time and effort saver for getting things consistent across browsers.</p>
