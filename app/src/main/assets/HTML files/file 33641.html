<p>What I am saying here is just some thoughts that I have not tested, so take that into account when you read this. Since MediaRouterActionProvider is managed by the framework, I don't think you can manually hide it; I imagine system will override that upon its periodic scan. I see two options here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use MediaRouteButton instead of ActionProvider; that is also supported by CCL and the visibility of that is completely up to you (CCL provides some callbacks that can tell you when there is a device matching your filters or not and you can clearly do as you see fit with that data). This is my recommended approach</p></li>
<li><p>Use a hack: have two MediaRouteSelector; one that is associated with an appId that doesn't exist (or is not published and no device is associated with that) and a second one which is associated with your good appId. If you use the first selector, the button will disappear since there is no device qualified for that appId and second one wold behave normally.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I think the first option is cleaner. Let us know if it works out for you or not.</p>
