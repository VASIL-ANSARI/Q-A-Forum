<p>The first (homework) question seems to be an example both of encapsulation and of abstraction.  Who knows what your teacher expects?</p>

<p>As for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A member data is private, it is not exposed to users, but it can be changed by member functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is a true/false question, and you copied it down verbatim, then the answer is false.  Data members of classes can be public.  If there should be an "if" at the beginning of the sentence, then the answer changes to true.</p>

<p>If you are going to post homework questions there is really no excuse for introducing ambiguity and grammatical mistakes in the transcription phase.</p>
