<p>The bad <code>console.log()</code> makes it "work" because the error breaks the script execution before entering the second <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fixing the real issue</h2>

<p><code>down == 1</code> is always <code>true</code>. You should use an <code>else</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>if ($('#uparrow'+id).length){
    arrowdown(id);
} else if ($('#downarrow'+id).length){
    arrowup(id);
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding it</h2>

<p><code>down == 1</code> is always true independently of <code>up == 1</code>. Here's your logic explained in pseudo-code in both scenarios:</p>

<pre><code>var up = 1, down = 0;
if (up) { down = 1; up = 0; } //enters this block, down now is 1
if (down) { down = 0; up = 1; } //enters this block as down == 1
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>var up = 0, down = 1;
if (up) { down = 1; up = 0; } //doesn't enter this block
if (down) { down = 0; up = 1; } //enters this block as down == 1
</code></pre>

<p>You just have put an <code>else</code> in there so the execution flow does not enter the second if statement in case the first one succeeds.</p>

<pre><code>if (up) {}
else if (down) {}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Truthy/Falsy values</h2>

<p>To explain why I'm using <code>.length</code> isolated inside the conditional statement: in JavaScript, the number <code>0</code> is a falsy value and <code>1</code> is truthy, hence these can be used directly inside the <code>if</code> statement and it will be interpreted based on the internal <a href="http://es5.github.io/#x9.2" rel="nofollow"><code>ToBoolean</code></a> algorithm logic. Obviously you can <code>== 1</code> if you feel like, that's more clear though slightly redundant.</p>

<hr>

<h2>A possibly simpler way around</h2>

<p>Going a little off-topic, but your goal can most likely be achieved in an easier way. I may be oversimplifying your logic, but depending on your intents you may just toggle between those two classes:</p>

<pre><code>function embiggen(id) {
    $('#arrow'+id).toggleClass('icon-chevron-up icon-chevron-down');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you'd no longer have to create a new <code>#downarrow</code>/<code>#uparrow</code> element each time the function is called. If said arrow has JS behavior attached, you can check which logic to execute through an <code>if</code> statement using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/" rel="nofollow"><code>hasClass()</code></a>.</p>
