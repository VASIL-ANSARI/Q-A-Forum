<p>How about this?:</p>

<pre><code>2.3.0 :003 &gt; x, (y, z) = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
 =&gt; [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2.3.0 :004 &gt; x
 =&gt; [1, 2]
2.3.0 :005 &gt; y
 =&gt; 3
2.3.0 :006 &gt; z
 =&gt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>or this?:</p>

<pre><code>2.3.0 :007 &gt; x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
 =&gt; [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2.3.0 :008 &gt; y, z = x
 =&gt; [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2.3.0 :009 &gt; y
 =&gt; [1, 2]
2.3.0 :010 &gt; z
 =&gt; [3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you really wanted to combine them all into one statement (though that might be less clear):</p>

<pre><code>2.3.0 :011 &gt; y, z = (x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 =&gt; [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2.3.0 :012 &gt; x
 =&gt; [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2.3.0 :013 &gt; y
 =&gt; [1, 2]
2.3.0 :014 &gt; z
 =&gt; [3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>I may not understand what you want to do; I don't think <code>map</code> is what you want because that performs the same operation on all elements in the input array, and you're mixing whole array and array element operations.  Here's a method that <em>may</em> do what you want, I don't know...</p>

<pre><code>2.3.0 :017 &gt; def f(x)
2.3.0 :018?&gt;   y, z = x
2.3.0 :019?&gt;   yield x, y, z
2.3.0 :020?&gt;   end
 =&gt; :f
2.3.0 :030 &gt; f([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) { |x, y, z| p x; p y; p z }
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
</code></pre>
