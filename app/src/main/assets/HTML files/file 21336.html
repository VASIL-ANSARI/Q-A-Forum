<pre><code>// Find an element, make a copy of it, and remove it's class
var head = $("thead#tHead1").clone().removeAttr("class");

// Within the cloned element (not on the DOM yet),
// Find an element within and then remove that found element.
$(head).find("#hRow2").remove();

// Wrap the cloned element in another element, giving it a parent.
// Traverse to that parent and return it's html content
head = $(head).wrap("&lt;thead&gt;").parent().html();
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>$(head)</code> shouldn't be needed here.  That can simply be <code>head</code> instead. You don't need to convert the element to a jQuery wrapped object because it should already be one.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, this is terrible code.  It's a kludgy hack on the DOM to do whatever it is supposed to.  INstead you should using a templating engine of some kind to generate fresh DOM fragments as needed based on some input data.</p>
