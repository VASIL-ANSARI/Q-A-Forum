<p>With CodeIgniter v2.x, a Javascript <em>driver</em> was introduced. I recommend looking at the user guide here: <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/javascript.html">http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/javascript.html</a></p>

<p>But with regards to it being a library that is useful, I think you could be misconstruing the point slightly.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Javascript libraries and frameworks out there to handle client-side interactivity. CodeIgniter is a server-side framework, so it cannot intermingle with a client-side framework...</p>

<p>So ultimately, a CodeIgniter javascript library isn't exactly needed. You accomplish everything javascript related in your view portion of MVC.</p>

<p>What is it exactly that you would like to do? I can maybe help/advise further if you can elaborate a bit... :)</p>
