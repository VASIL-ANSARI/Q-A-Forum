<p>Your custom view needs to extend <code>ViewGroup</code> or one of the other classes that extends <code>ViewGroup</code>. For example, you could extend from <code>RelativeLayout</code> or <code>LinearLayout</code> if those layouts fits what your custom view needs to do.</p>

<p>Remember, even the layout classes are just another <code>View</code>. They just happen to have methods to add other views as children and have code to recursively measure and draw their children.</p>
