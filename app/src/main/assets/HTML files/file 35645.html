<p>Looks like basic JavaScript. </p>

<p>An object named <em>module</em> has a property named <em>exports</em> that is an object. </p>

<p>This object has a property named <em>new</em> whose value is an anonymous function.</p>

<p>In theory you could invoke the method like this:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports.new(someRequest, someResponse);
</code></pre>
