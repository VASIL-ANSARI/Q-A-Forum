<p>Well, you explanation seems weird.. You say  postmeta.distance > postmeta.radius but you select it from hlp_postmeta , also M alias seem not to do anything. So, I'm guessing you have a few typos here, Either you want it from postmeta like you said, and then I think this is what you need:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT p.ID
FROM  posts p
LEFT JOIN  postmeta m ON p.ID = m.post_id
LEFT JOIN  postmeta m2 ON p.ID = m2.post_id
WHERE p.post_type = 'babysitter'
    AND p.post_status = 'publish'
    AND m2.meta_key = 'distance'
    AND m.meta_key = 'radius'
    AND m2.meta_value &gt; m.meta_value
</code></pre>

<p>Or you its not like you said and its from hlp_postmeta and then:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT p.ID
FROM  posts p
LEFT JOIN  postmeta m ON p.ID = m.post_id
LEFT JOIN  hlp_postmeta m2 ON p.ID = m2.post_id
WHERE p.post_type = 'babysitter'
    AND p.post_status = 'publish'
    AND m2.meta_key = 'distance'
    AND m.meta_key = 'radius'
    AND m2.meta_value &gt; m.meta_value
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I can be wrong in both cases, if so tell me and I'll correct it.</p>
