<li><p>I don't have a way to test the Disney site you reference on
either a WP7 or BB5 device but it is entirely possible that if that
site isn't rendering on those devices that is the result of markup
or script beyond jQuery Mobile. I would suggest you code some simple
test designs for your own site and see how those render on you WP7
and BB5 devices. Also, how will you be developing the native portion
of your hybrid app for all these platforms? That seems to be a much
more significant issues than jQuery Mobile.</p></li>
<li><p>codiqa is a prototyping tool I don't know of many people that are
using that tool to build production web sites. There may be people
out there that do but most people I know code jQuery Mobile markup
by hand or as part of a larger server side scripting technology. I
use Visual Studio and asp.net mvc.</p></li>
<li><p>You are correct that you cannot use hash tags within jQuery Mobile
but you can use standard query string parameters such as
<code>m.myuser.com?deviceid=123</code>. Your approach will largely be dictated
by your page implementation. Are you building based on a single page
or multiple page template.</p></li>
<li><p>jQuery Mobile doesn't produce the ultimate, native looking web sites
that you may hope for  but it does a great job of producing
consistent looking sites that will render across a wide range of
devices. You may have to tweak your site based on some gross
categories of screen sizes or phones vs tables but no, if you build
your site correctly, you shouldn't have to worry about every
permutation of screen size.</p></li>
