<p>Just drop the actual recursion. <code>os.walk</code> recurses through the entire directory tree for you. If you really insist on doing recursion, check out <code>os.listdir</code> to list a single directory (non-recursively) together with <code>os.path.isdir</code> and <code>os.path.isfile</code> to determine what is a folder and what is a file.</p>
