<p>Two ways I have done this 1 you can check the process name</p>

<pre><code>bool isRunningInIisExpress = Process.GetCurrentProcess()
                                .ProcessName.ToLower().Contains("iisexpress");
</code></pre>

<p>Or update your config file with a custom setting</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key="ApplicationEnvironment" value="LOCAL_DEV" /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That you update specifically for each environment and have you application query for</p>

<p>I'm  not sure if there is a way to determine this at compile time, besides having a special build configuration that is for each environment and putting a custom <code>PRAGMA</code> for each of these builds. Personally I think that is not as elegant, but it could also work. </p>
