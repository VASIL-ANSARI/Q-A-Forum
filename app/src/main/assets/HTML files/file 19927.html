<p>@Robin, in order to speed up the data transfer process you should take the proper steps to ensure all processing is done in-memory as well as you should avoid any WRITEs to disk as much as you possibly can.
If you do the following steps, the file transfer processing time should be reduced:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, configure your DB instance to have as much temporary workspace allocated as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, split the process into a multiple-step process, so that each processing phase will be completed with minimum WRITE to disk activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, disable the binary log; this will reduce WRITE to disk processing, which in many cases can reduce query response times by as much as half.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These steps should speed up the process, but taking into account the amount of data rows you have, it still might take a certain amount of time to transfer and process.</p>
