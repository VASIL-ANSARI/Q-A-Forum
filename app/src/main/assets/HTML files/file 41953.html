<p>The idea here is that you should create a lightbox itself first to be in DOM. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="lightbox1"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="name1"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="address1"/&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your button should fill its input with specific value. You can use also jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$("#name1").val("John");
$("#address1").val("My street 1");
...
</code></pre>

<p>I think the idea is clear now. If so, you need just take values from the row instead of "John" and "My street 1". The simplest way will be to name every component in rows for using in jQuery or you can find parent element for the every button on the row and relatively to that find particular inputs (this will be little challenging if you're new to HTML and JS).</p>

<p>For lightbox you can use any lightbox solution written in jQuery and attach the "div" element to that lightbox. </p>
