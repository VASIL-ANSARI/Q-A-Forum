<p>At least in Visual studio this code should give you a warning, because you're using a reference to a temporary object that will be destroyed, so you're using a reference to youdontknowwhat. It's undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>You can simply return <code>result</code> by value in order to solve the problem. If the vector is big and you're worried about performance of returning by value, you can set a move constructor for <code>Polynomial</code> in which you move the vector instead than copying it.</p>
