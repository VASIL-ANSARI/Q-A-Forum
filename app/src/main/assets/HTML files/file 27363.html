<p>You'll need to test the value of <code>$uac_check</code> again.</p>

<pre><code>if($uac_check == "Owner" or $uac_check == "Admin") {
</code></pre>

<p>Boolean operators like <code>or</code> and <code>and</code> need a boolean value on both sides of them.  When you have an expression like $uac_check == "Owner", it evaluates to a true or false value, also known as a "boolean" value.  You have <code>$uac_check</code> on the other side.  Most variables will evaluate to true when cast as a boolean value unless they are empty, null or 0.  That's likely to give you results you don't expect.</p>

<p>Note that I re-wrote the <code>OR</code> operator as <code>or</code>.  Both are valid, and so is <code>||</code> .</p>

<p>One last note - you can make tests more specific to avoid "misunderstandings" in PHP.  PHP is very lax about types, so it will tell you that <code>"1" == 1</code> and <code>0 == false</code> are true, when the 1 character and the number 1 are not the same thing, nor are 0 and false equal.  You can avoid mistakes like this by using the <code>===</code> operator, which checks both value <em>and</em> type.  This can be very important, especially with certain functions that can return 0 and false with two very different meanings.  It's called the <code>identical</code> operator.  You can read more about comparisons in the PHP manual on the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php" rel="nofollow">Comparison Operators</a> page.</p>
