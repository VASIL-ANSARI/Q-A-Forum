<p>The Image Button and Button controls are both derived from the View class, but
they are unrelated to each other. The Button class is actually a direct subclass
of Text View (think of it as a line of text with a background graphic that looks
like a button), whereas the Image Button class is a direct subclass of Image View.</p>
