<p>There's no particular <em>technical</em> problem with displaying modal message boxes by setting the window handle to null.  I question its use as a UI error message indication, because it doesn't prevent the user from continuing in the face of error.</p>

<p>Modal message boxes that make the user hit OK and then correct the error make for a terribly clunky user interface.  But a popup that might be hidden and lets the user keep going is just as bad.  There are much better solutions, some of which are shown in the validation examples for Windows Forms (and, presumably WPF).</p>
