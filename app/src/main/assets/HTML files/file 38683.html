<p>The jar you created has dependency on junit.jar so download it from <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjunit38jar.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>
and include it in the classpath while running your jar
One more thing as you are using terminal to run the jar  </p>

<p><strong>A small note</strong> - When you use -jar option, the JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other user class path settings are ignored. That means you cannot use -cp with -jar</p>
