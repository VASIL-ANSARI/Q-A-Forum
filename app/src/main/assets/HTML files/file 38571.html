<p>There's an official and very easy solution to your problem: <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/pure-android.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Don't mimic UI elements from other platforms</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don't use labeled back buttons on action bars</strong></p>
  
  <p>Other platforms use an explicit back button with label to allow the user to navigate up the application's hierarchy. Instead, Android uses the main action bar's app icon for hierarchical navigation and the navigation bar's back button for temporal navigation. For more information, please review the <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html" rel="nofollow">Navigation</a> pattern.</p>
  
  <p>Follow this guideline to provide a consistent navigation experience across the platform.</p>
