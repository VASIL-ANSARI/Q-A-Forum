<p>You should only include columns in the <code>select</code> that are either in the <code>group by</code> or that are in aggregation functions.  Hence, no columns such as <code>orderId</code>.</p>

<p>This is probably closer to what you are trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>select co.orderDate, 
       sum(op.paidPrice * op.qtyOrdered) as PriceTimesQuantity
from OrderedProduct op join
     CustOrder co
     on co.orderId = op.orderId
where co.orderDate between '2014-01-01' and '2014-12-31'
group by co.orderDate;
</code></pre>

<p>Your specific error is that you cannot reference an alias defined in the same <code>select</code> clause.</p>
