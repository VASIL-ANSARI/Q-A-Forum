<p>This snippet will do so.  If you're going to do it frequently, you might want to make a 'sortkeys' method or somesuch to make it easier on the eyes.</p>

<pre><code>keys = list(d.keys())
keys.sort()
for key in keys:
    print d[key]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:  dF's solution is better -- I forgot all about sorted().</p>
