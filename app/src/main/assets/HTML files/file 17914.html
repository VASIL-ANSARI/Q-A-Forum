<p>By "encapsulating the rendering", they are referring to the encapsulation of the functionality of rendering html.  </p>

<p>If there is a common piece of html you render often, (the rails form helpers for example), if you insert the code (or the code building functionality within a helper), each time you need to render that html (or a variant of it) , you merely call the helper method thereby keeping your code "dry" (html code in this case)</p>
