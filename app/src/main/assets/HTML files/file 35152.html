<p>It sounds like what is happening is that your browser is resizing the table to give a "best-fit" to your content. If you'd like to enforce a maximum width to the table column that contains the label, use the CSS <code>max-width</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's really no way to definitively answer your question for several reasons.</p>

<p>In the example you give above, the "Email" label is pretty much never going to wrap (absent some other style that you haven't provided) because it's a single word with no breakable points such as hyphenation points or spaces. To minimize confusion, you should provide more information, such as a mockup of the desired output, and a code sample that actually reproduces the undesirable behavior.</p>

<p>In addition, the markup is a bit of a mess. If you're using a generator of some kind, make sure it's configured correctly. Some well-formedness issues that I see:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nesting labels is incorrect. Labels should contain only
non-labelable content, other than the input with which a label is
associated.</li>
<li>You have a closing <code>span</code> tag with no opening <code>span</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And finally, you should also consider some best practices to make your code more readable, more semantic, and easier to maintain:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't use inline styles (e.g., the <code>style</code> attribute on the element). Assign classes as necessary in the markup and use an external stylesheet or a <code>style</code> block in the document <code>head</code> to apply presentation styles.</li>
<li>Similar to above, don't use <code>cellspacing</code>, <code>cellpadding</code>, etc attributes on your table. Use the appropriate CSS attributes instead.</li>
<li>You have a <code>label</code> with no associated <code>input</code> element. That's not the worst thing in the world, but the entire purpose of a <code>label</code> is to provide context for a form input. If you just want a block of text, use a more appropriate element such as <code>p</code>.</li>
</ol>
