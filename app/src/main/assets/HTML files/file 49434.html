<p>A few things come to mind. Have you checked what does the incoming html look like, does it have something that doesn't belong there? And is the xpath you're looking for correct? At least in this older answer it seems that the range for xpath should be given in form </p>

<p><code>[position() &gt;= 100 and not(position() &gt; 200)]</code> </p>

<p>Edit: And now that I think of it, it might be possible that if there are less than the desired amount of items in the actual html, maybe the xpath valuates the range expression as false and thus none are found with the query?</p>
