<p>I'm not entirely sure what do you want to do. But as far as I understood you'd like to keep the program running if an exception occur. And that's what your script is doing. The <code>except</code>statement catches your exception and preventing your program from crashing (and change <code>status</code>). Thereafter the rest of the <code>some_method</code>-function is executed. If you want to see it on the command line simply print it in the except block.</p>

<p>If you'd like to crash your program and print the exception to the command line, remove the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> statement.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
