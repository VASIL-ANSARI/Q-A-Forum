<p>while this doesn't answer your question directly, I wanted to say that I tried following your route using Apple's unit testing information and found it to be a non optimal TDD approach, so I opted to use what other people recommended :</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2009/02/testing/iphone-unit-testing-toolkit" rel="nofollow">Tutorial</a> about how to get this running and a discusion about the different options available for iPhone unit testing. </p>

<p>I think the option provided by apple can only run in simulator mode, and have many other disadvantages... sorry for not answering your question directly but maybe you could tackle the problem with a different perspective ( like the ones I posted you here ). </p>
