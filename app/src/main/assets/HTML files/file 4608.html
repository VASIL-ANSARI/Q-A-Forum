<p>If you have:</p>

<pre><code>float f;
double d;
</code></pre>

<p>...then an arithmetic expression like <code>f * d</code> will promote both operands to the larger type, which in this case is <code>double</code>.</p>

<p>So, the expression <code>a * (b + c) * d</code> evaluates to a <code>double</code>, and is then stored in <code>result</code>, which is also a <code>double</code>.  This type promotion is done in order to avoid accidental precision loss.</p>
