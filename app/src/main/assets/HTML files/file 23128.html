<p>Your problem is that <code>field</code> <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/documents.html#fields" rel="nofollow">actually defines string types by default</a>. </p>

<p>I think you should think the other way around. Let mongoid generate the mongodb document for you. One way to achieve what you are looking for is to define another <code>Mongoid::Document</code> "Date" and have your class 
<code>Member</code> embed id as:</p>

<pre><code>embedds_many :dates
</code></pre>

<p>This would work. If you don't want to define a custom <code>Mongoid::Document</code> for that, just use a  hash field like:</p>

<pre><code>field :dates, :type =&gt; Hash
</code></pre>
