<p>The <strong>self</strong> parameter is really only named self by convention, and that isn't even a universally accepted convention - I also often see <strong>cls</strong> or <strong>this</strong> used instead.</p>

<p>The term <strong>self</strong> isn't a keyword in python like it is in, say, Java. The user can choose to name it anything they want - although it would be better to choose one name and stick with that throughout the code for clarity, there isn't anything stopping you from naming it something different in every method.</p>
