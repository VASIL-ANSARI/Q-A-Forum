<p>The quota limit is based upon the number of requests being sent not which account its being requested against or which refresh token is doing the sending.</p>

<p>The only quota I think may cause you a problem is the requests per second quota.  You are allowed 100 req/sec if you don't set quota user this is set by the IP address.  So if this is running though your website you are only going to be able to send 100 Requests a second.  If you randomized quota user. (No I am not sure how to send quota user in JavaScript you will need to look that up) that would remove this problem.</p>

<p>+1 for being the first person I have seen that figured out how to get around the no service account issue with JavaScript :)</p>
