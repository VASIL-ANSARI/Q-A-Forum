<p>I guess the best way would be to traverse the filesystem based on your current OS and finding the executables of the browsers you want.</p>

<p>Maybe you can take the Launchy code and make it do what you want? :)<br>

  <p>Launchy is helper class for launching cross-platform applications in a fire and forget 
  manner. 
  Currently only launching a browser is supported. </p>
  
  <p><code>Launchy.open("http://www.ruby-lang.org/")</code></p>
