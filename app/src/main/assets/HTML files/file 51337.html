<p><code>LIKE</code> doesn't support regular expressions. The only wildcards it supports are <code>%</code> for multiple characters and <code>_</code> for a single character. To match against a regular expression you need <a href="http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/builtinfunctions-chapt.html#N1382C" rel="nofollow"><code>regexp_matches()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE user 
   ADD CONSTRAINT check_user_first_name 
   CHECK (regexp_matches(first_name, '[A-Z]+'))
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow only uppercase letters, so you probably want to use <code>'[A-Za-z]+'</code> instead.  It also requires at least one character in the name. If you want to allow empty strings, change the <code>+</code> to <code>*</code>. This will still allow null values though.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that <code>USER</code> is a reserved keyword in SQL. You shouldn't create a table with that name. If you try this e.g. on Oracle or PostgreSQL it will fail. The name requires to be quoted - which is not a good idea. You should find a different name.</p>
