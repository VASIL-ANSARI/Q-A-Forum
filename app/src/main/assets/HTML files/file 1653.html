<p>It's not a quick and simple answer, I'd recommend reading through the following CodePlex links for WCF Security Guidance:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurity" rel="nofollow">WCF Security</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide" rel="nofollow">WCF Security Guidance</a>. </p>

<p>The site provides step by step checklists for different scenarios, one of which you should be able to relate to your scenario. Different scenarios and security setups are provided for intranet/Internet scenarios with authentication mechanisms including: None, Basic, NTLM, Windows, Certificates, Username, Tokens. Autorization options include: Role based, Identity based and Resource based. <a href="http://wcfsecurityguide.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Ch%2005%20-%20Authentication%2c%20Authorization%20and%20Identities%20in%20WCF&amp;referringTitle=Home" rel="nofollow">(See chapter 5)</a></p>
