<p>The correct logic for an overlap is a bit simpler:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(1) 
FROM t1 INNER JOIN
     t2
     ON CAST(t1.StartTime as TIME) &lt; CAST(t2.EndTime as TIME) and
        CAST(t1.EndTime as TIME) &gt; CAST(t2.StartTime as TIME);
</code></pre>

<p>The logic is that one interval starts before the other ends, and ends after the other starts.</p>
