<p>At no point do you call <code>CreateArray</code>.  You call your other function, <code>IntSum</code>, which does precisely nothing.  Also, you create a variable <code>example</code> and assign a dom element to it, then you immediately overwrite it with a (noop) function result.  There are additional issues with your code as well.</p>

<p>My advice: slow down, determine what it is you need to accomplish, and take it step by step.</p>
