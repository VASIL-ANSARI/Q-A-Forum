<p>There doesnt seem to be a way around this issue. Other projects seem to use lower level apis (such as libstagefright) to do their decoding. That method does let you get at the data</p>

<p>[EDIT]
There isn't a way around the starvation issue. Android just doesn't adhere to the spec. Basically you need to buffer into memory and make sure that you use pause and resume to decoding when you need to control the flow of the data.</p>
