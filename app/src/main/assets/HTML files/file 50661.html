<p>You're making a new class object using <code>$db = new DB_CONNECT();</code>. Then after you're trying to run <code>$result = $db -&gt; query("SELECT * FROM corsi");</code>, but returns a syntax error, since there is no method <code>query()</code> in your class object.</p>

<p>What you want to do is make a public property and define this in your <code>connect()</code> method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>class DB_CONNECT {
    public $sth;

    ...

    public function connect() {
        ...

        $this-&gt;sth = $mysqli;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use <code>$db-&gt;sth-&gt;query()</code>, as <code>$db-&gt;sth</code> is your MySQL object now.</p>
