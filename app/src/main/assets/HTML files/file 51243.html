<p>Look at Replacing IJsonSerializer serializer here <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki/Extensibility" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki/Extensibility</a>, the setting you need is called ReferenceLoopHandling <a href="http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_ReferenceLoopHandling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_ReferenceLoopHandling.htm</a></p>

<p>Though I would strongly advise against passing complex object graphs between application boundaries.</p>
