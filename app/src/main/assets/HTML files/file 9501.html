<p>You are doing <code>alloc-init</code> every time you are in the loop but there isn't a release so there is a leak in your code.</p>

<pre><code>NSString* xmlFragment  = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes: [data bytes] length:[data length] encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding];
</code></pre>

<p>There is no balancing <code>release</code> for the statement above. If you do,</p>

<pre><code>NSString* xmlFragment  = [[[NSString alloc] initWithBytes: [data bytes] length:[data length] encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>It will be deallocated at <code>[pool drain];</code>. However the loop seems pointless. You probably meant to do a bit more like add <code>xmlFragment</code> to a mutable string perhaps?</p>
