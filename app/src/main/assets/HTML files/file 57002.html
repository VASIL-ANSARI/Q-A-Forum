<p>I suppose, an exception is thrown when you try to access element in the array with an index, which doesn't actually exist. It's typical situation, when you get <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> or <code>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you in which line is a real mistake without debugging the application. Your <code>translate(String)</code> method is doing strange stuff and code is not so clean. Nevertheless, I have the following candidates, which could cause that exception:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vowels[i]</code> - <code>i</code> variable is calculated by int <code>i = word.indexOf("i");</code> and <code>word</code> is calculated by <code>txtTxtIn.substring(0, space);</code>, but you cannot be sure about length of <code>txtxTxtIn</code>, but max index of <code>vovels</code> is 4. When <code>txtTxtIn</code> has more characters than 5, an exception will be thrown</li>
<li><code>txtTxtIn = txtTxtIn.substring(space + 1);</code> - here may be similar story as above</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestion is to debug this code. Moreover, you could use <code>List</code>. It's Java and we have such structures here. It would be much easier to perform operations on strings and chars and harder to make such mistake.</p>
