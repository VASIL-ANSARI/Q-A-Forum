<p>If you join the tables this way and use the group by in the main query, you will first join the records of the <code>map_user_question_vote</code> table (twice) with the records of the <code>questions</code> table and sum will be calculated later for the same question groups (although the column names are different, the values will be the same).</p>

<p>You need to join with subqueries where you first calculate the sum of the votes. I.e.:</p>

<pre><code>select
  questions.id
, questions.question
, parent.id as parentId
, parent.question as parentQuestion
, COALESCE(qv.sum_vote, 0) as parent_question_vote_score
, COALESCE(cv.sum_vote, 0) as comment_vote_score

from `questions`

join `questions` as `parent` on
     `questions`.`parent` = `parent`.`id`

left join (select `question_id`, sum(`vote`) as `sum_vote` from `map_user_question_vote` group by `question_id`) as `cv` on 
          `cv`.`question_id` = `questions`.`id`

left join (select `question_id`, sum(`vote`) as `sum_vote` from `map_user_question_vote` group by `question_id`) as `qv` on
          `qv`.`question_id` = `parent`.`id`

where questions.user_id = 1
  and questions.parent  &gt; 0

limit 5
</code></pre>
