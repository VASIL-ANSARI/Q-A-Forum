<p>I did the following and it solved the problem:</p>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>export adb=path/to/adb

for f in "$@"
do
    $adb devices
    $adb do-something "$f"
done

# using adb devices; doesn't work as adb was not recognized, 
# so I exported it from full path

# $@ are my files that I wont to run my script upon
</code></pre>
