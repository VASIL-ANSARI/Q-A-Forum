<p>I'm not sure which library you are using, but getting Twitter Trend URLs should be fairly easy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/trends/daily" rel="nofollow">documentation for Daily Trends</a> shows that the URL is not returned.</p>

<p>You will get something like this in return:</p>

<pre><code>{

"trends": {

"2011-01-14 15:20": [

  {

    "name": "#confessionhour",

    "events": null,

    "promoted_content": null,

    "query": "#confessionhour"

  },

  {

    "name": "#thankssuju",

    "events": null,

    "promoted_content": null,

    "query": "#thankssuju"

  },
...
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is to use the "query" element.  You can then use this to create a URL.</p>

<p>If you want to point the user to the Twitter mobile search for that trend, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>https://mobile.twitter.com/search/%23thankssuju
</code></pre>

<p>In your library I would expect you can get this using getQuery();</p>
