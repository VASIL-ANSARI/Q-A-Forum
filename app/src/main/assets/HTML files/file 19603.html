<p>This script is not the problem, you must have another script stripping out the classes.  I must mention, however, that you do not currently have any "preset" classes on your list items currently.  The only class being applied is the "show" class which is expected.  This class is properly being removed, also as expected.</p>

<p>I've reproduced your slider with two classes (that offer background colors for emphasis) to demonstrate that this does indeed work.  I did not change any of the jquery.</p>
