<p>The definition that's causing it is this:</p>

<pre><code>#hd {
    margin-top: 99px;
    position: relative;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you turn that off, the apparent margin on the body goes away. Somehow, its being the first item in the page and being positioned relatively is causing it to go like that. I'm not certain of the precise reason why.</p>
