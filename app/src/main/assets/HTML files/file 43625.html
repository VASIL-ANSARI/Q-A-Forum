<p>Remove indexes on PrimaryPhoto.model and remove the join add it to the where clause. Your query should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  Listing.*,  PrimaryPhoto.* 
 FROM listings AS Listing  
 LEFT JOIN file_storage AS PrimaryPhoto  
 ON PrimaryPhoto.foreign_key  =  Listing.ID
 WHERE  Listing.rent  &gt;= 0 
 AND  Listing.rent  &lt;= 5000 
 AND  Listing.beds  &gt;= 1 
 AND  Listing.is_active  = '1' 
 AND  PrimaryPhoto.model  = 'PrimaryListingPhoto'
 ORDER BY Listing.modified  DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Also try not to make a select with <code>*</code> only select the necessary columns.</p>
