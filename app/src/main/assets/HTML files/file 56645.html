<p>Just by chance, I've read this nice piece just yesterday. The article goes in detail with an example on how to create a system to recognize birds in  a photo - but as a rule of thumb, unless you can't at least understand and laugh on the XKCD cartoon at the beginning, just consider seriously subcontracting someone to do it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: that is the third part in a tutorial on neural networking using Python + Tensorflow, and at the end of it, there is a complete Python script to train a model to recognize birds in photos - just training the network with airplane photos should get the desired result. </p>
