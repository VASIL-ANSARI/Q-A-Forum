<p>If you have multiple textboxes you are better of storing them in an array of some kind so that you can refer to them as <code>textbox[0]</code> , <code>textbox[1]</code> etc etc</p>

<p>or do them in a loop like</p>

<pre><code>for ( int i = 0 ; i &lt; 5 ; ++i )
     textbox[i]-&gt;Text = "Bar";
</code></pre>
