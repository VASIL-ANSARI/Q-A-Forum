<p>I think it's just:</p>

<pre><code>outputFile = file( "textbase.tab", "wb" )
for k, v in textData.iteritems():
    complete_line = k + '~~~~~' + v + '~~~~~' + " ENDOFTHELINE"
    outputFile.write((complete_line + "\n").encode("iso-8859-1"))
    outputFile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>As you alluded to, you need to make sure you are decoding the RTF file correctly too.  For this to work, k and v should be unicode objects.</p>
