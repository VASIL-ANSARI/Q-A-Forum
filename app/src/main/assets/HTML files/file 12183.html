<p>You can get a value back from an <code>EditText</code> with</p>

<pre><code>EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText1);
String value = editText.getText().toString();
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend <code>.trim()</code>'ing this value, since you probably don't want the trailing whitespace users tend to leave.</p>

<p>You should use a <code>Button</code> onClick event to call the above methods, because it's more or less likely to be the UX you are looking for.</p>
