<p>Let's review your code.
First- </p>

<pre><code>NSString *st = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.jpg",theFileName];
NSData *imageData2=UIImagePNGRepresentation(_imageview1.image);
</code></pre>

<p>You are saving a .jpg image with PNG representation, shouldn't you use jpeg representation instead?</p>

<pre><code>UIImageJPEGRepresentation(_imageview.image, 1.0) 
</code></pre>

<p>Second-</p>

<pre><code>[imageData2 writeToFile:saveImagePath atomically:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>Right here you are not sure wether the image was saved successfully or not. Please add a condition </p>

<pre><code>if([imageData2 writeToFile:saveImagePath atomically:YES]){

// here you are sure that the image was saved and you can use it.

}
</code></pre>

<p>Third- </p>

<pre><code>documentInteractionController.UTI = @"public.plain-text";
</code></pre>

<p>You are sharing a jpg image, why is your UTI plain-text? Shouldn't it be <code>public.image</code>? </p>

<p>Just try to solve those issue and your code should work successfully.</p>
