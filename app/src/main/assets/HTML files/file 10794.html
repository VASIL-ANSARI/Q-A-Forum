<p>So I think, if I understand you right, you want to be able to add different members such as Grunt, CommunicationOfficer, and General (just for examples) to a Team. Then you want to be able to iterate on all the Grunts, or all the Generals?</p>

<p>So yes, I think Unit as a superclass, and then Grunt, General, and so on all extend Unit. I think you might want to maintain separate ArrayLists for each type, and one ArrayList for all units. Then, when you add a unit, add it both to the appropriate type-specific ArrayList, and to the overall ArrayList.</p>

<p>Now, if you want only the Grunt objects, use the ArrayList grunts. Otherwise, if you want all the units, use ArrayList units.</p>
