<p>Here are two possible ways of "removing" items from an array in C (there are other possible way too):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Replace the item in the array with another items which states that this item is not valid.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the <code>char</code> array</p>

<pre>
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| F | o | o | b | a | r |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>

<p>and you want to "remove" the <code>b</code> the it <em>could</em> look like</p>

<pre>
+---+---+---+------+---+---+
| F | o | o | \xff | a | r |
+---+---+---+------+---+---+
</pre></li>
<li><p>Shift the remaining content of the array one step up.</p>

<p>To use the same example from above, the array after shifting would look like</p>

<pre>
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| F | o | o | a | r |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>

<p>This can be implemented by a simple <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memmove" rel="nofollow"><code>memmove</code></a> call.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember for this is that you need to keep track of the size, and decrease it every time you remove a character.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course both these methods can be combined: First use number one in a loop, and once done you can permanently remove the unused entries in the array with number two.</p>
