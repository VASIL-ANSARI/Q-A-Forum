<p>I also prefer to avoid pointers when not necessary, but many game programmers use pointers when not required, allocating pretty much anything large with new, making it global (!), and calling delete at the end.</p>

<p>There is a small advantage to using dynamic allocation (more than offset by the risk of pointer errors, IMJ).  When you assign between two objects, you need a copy ctor, which means you have to decide whether to share memory.  That's often a bad idea, and if you don't, your copy ctor may need to do a lot of work (whereas copying a pointer is very cheap).  Later versions of C++ obviate some of this problem, but not all.</p>

<p>But in SDL, you're really forced to by SDL's choice to deallocate not simply with delete or free, but with its special functions <code>SDL_FreeSurface</code>, <code>SDL_DestroyTexture</code>, etc.  For structures using such functions, you're just stuck.  Therefore SDL programmers allocate these things dynamically, even if they aren't hardcore game programmers who think everything in sight should be made a pointer.  You can write wrappers to clean things up a bit, but underneath, you're still stuck with their deletion routines.</p>
