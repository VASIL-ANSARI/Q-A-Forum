<p>I'm more familiar with Angular, but all the <code>Single Page Applications</code> (<code>SPA</code>) are based on the the same model. You have three layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>Rails</code> MVC routing system with its routes and controllers</li>
<li>the <code>React</code> SPA routing system (that also has its own
routes and controller system)</li>
<li>the <code>React</code> event handling system that, as a javascript framework, among other things, catches mouse clicks in the web application</li>
</ul>

<p>In your <code>reactrails</code> example page, the root of your web site (<code>/</code>) is handled by <code>Rails</code>, and every other pages (<code>/*</code>) are intercepted and handled by the <code>react</code> routing system.</p>

<p>So basically, if you have a rails <code>ApplicationController</code> you could have a <code>config/routes.rb</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code># routes.rb
root 'application#main'
# catch every routes and serve only the Application.main action
match '*path', to: 'application#main'

# application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController
    def main
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will redirect every urls coming to <code>Rails</code> (<code>/this/is/an/example</code>, <code>/that/one/is/not/an/example</code>...) to the <code>React</code> router. (Note that you could also have other routes such as <code>/api/gimme/my/damn/json/data</code> that will resolve to other controllers and send back <code>JSON</code>, <code>xml</code>, <code>html</code> or any kind of data)</p>

<p>Then, in your html page, <code>React</code> intercepts every clicks, on links or buttons, and compare them to its own routes.<br>
If a route match, it will display the correct page via its templating system, (usually loading it by <code>Ajax</code> or read it from its cache), and you won't see any page reload. You could say that <code>react</code> act has a client-side server.</p>

<p>If you call a url such as <code>/i/like/flowers</code>, the route will be first processed by <code>rails</code> (<code>/*</code>), that will send you an <code>html</code> file located at the <code>/</code> route, containing your <code>SPA</code> app, that will kicks in, analyse the route itself, and show you the correct content from its own templating system.</p>

<p>So to sum up, you have:</p>

<pre><code>GET /my/super/react/url
//=&gt; Rails serves `main.html` that includes `react-router`
</code></pre>

<p>Once <code>main.html</code> is loaded, <code>react-router</code> looks at its routes components and serve the right template if route exists (<code>/my/super/react/url</code>).</p>

<p>You could find more examples in the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/RouteConfiguration.md" rel="nofollow">react-router documentation</a></p>

<p>This is the basic scenario, and I'm sure others will complete anything I didn't cover, and add <code>react</code> specific samples!</p>
