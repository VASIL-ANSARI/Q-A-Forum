<p>I had the exact same behavior a few times when implementing In App Purchases. I could solve it every time by waiting for some time and trying again. For me it took up to 3 days to work. The App store sandbox is not really reliable. So when you've checked your ID's twice and it's still not working just wait a day or two and magically it will work.</p>
