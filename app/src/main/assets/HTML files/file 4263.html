<p>I;ve installed Zend FW on many Linux system and if I encountered problems it was on the include path that was set incorrectly or permission problem.</p>

<p>Maybe the path isn't right, try 'vi /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php' or any other text editor that you like. Does it work?
Maybe it is permission problem, try to change /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/ to 755:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 775 /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php -R
</code></pre>
