<p>Your query is off. <code>WHERE A, B AND C</code> is not valid MySQL; rather, it should be <code>WHERE A AND B AND C</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT targets_set
FROM targets
WHERE 
    targets_nmc='F80' 
    AND sp_dealer_code=$dealer 
    AND `targets_date` BETWEEN '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2014-01-31 23:59:59'
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>When the statement is executed, no result set is given back. That's why you get that error message when you try to fetch the result as an associative array.</p>
