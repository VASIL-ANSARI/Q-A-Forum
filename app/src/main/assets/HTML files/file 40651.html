<p>When you do a GET, you supply params in the url. When you do a POST, you supply them in the request. Also, not sure why you're creating a cookies object if you're not using it.</p>

<p>You don't need:</p>

<pre><code>Dim res As HttpWebResponse
Dim cookies As New CookieContainer()
</code></pre>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>'Create the post string which contains the params
Dim postString As String = "name=" &amp; name &amp; "&amp;n=" &amp; R.Next(0, 20000)

'Create the request
req = WebRequest.Create("http://blablabla.net/Checkusername.php")
req.Method = "POST"
req.ContentLength = postString.Length
req.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

'put the POST params in the request
Dim requestWriter As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(req.GetRequestStream())
requestWriter.Write(postString)
requestWriter.Close()

'submit the request and read the response
Dim responseReader As StreamReader = New StreamReader(req.GetResponse().GetResponseStream())
Dim responseData As String = responseReader.ReadToEnd()

'close everything
responseReader.Close()
req.GetResponse().Close()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>responseData</strong> will contain your response string</p>

<p>You can also surround it with a Try/Catch to check for any exceptions...bad internet connection, bad url, no response, etc. <code>xmlhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status == 200</code> in the html means <code>request finished</code> and <code>OK</code></p>
