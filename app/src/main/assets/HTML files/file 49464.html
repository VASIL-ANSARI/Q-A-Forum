<p>There are several JSON serializers you can use in C#. Some have better performance, some have better fault tolerance and others have circular reference treatments.</p>

<p>In your case, I see that you simply want an object without passing it (to a WCF) anywhere. You can follow the second answer of this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9326146/3481183">Deserialize JSON into C# dynamic object?</a> Example code copied from that answer:</p>

<pre><code>dynamic stuff = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject("{ 'Name': 'Jon Smith', 'Address': { 'City': 'New York', 'State': 'NY' }, 'Age': 42 }");

string name = stuff.Name;
string address = stuff.Address.City;
</code></pre>

<p>A dynamic object in C# allows you to read a property without declaring a class for it.</p>
