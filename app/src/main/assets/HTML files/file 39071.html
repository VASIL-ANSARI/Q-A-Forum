<p>An emulated device is a connected device. I can't tell that gradle has a way of starting an emulator for you short of an Exec task. I leave a couple emulators always running in the background with -no-window, and on our CI I did up a little bash script to fire up a few at various API levels before gradle is invoked and then shut them down afterward.</p>

<p>I came here searching for an example of how deviceCheck is used. It seems like it's supposed to be self-evident.</p>
