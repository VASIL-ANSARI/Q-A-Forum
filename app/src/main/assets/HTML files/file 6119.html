<p>the link <code>friends/34/34/</code> is looking for a controller called "friends" and a method called "34", hence why it can't be found.</p>

<p>If your <code>friends</code> controller has no other methods, then change the link to this:</p>

<p><code>echo anchor_popup('friends/index/'.$uid.'/'.$suid,'add as friend',$attr);</code> </p>

<p>else, add the appropriate method.</p>
