<p>This is a result of the Android OS version you are running: the later is from 4.0 (or 3.x holo) and up, the the former is 2.x and below. The style is dependent on the os version: instead of relying on the sdk, you might use a third party library (where the style is defined and not dependent on the os version: look here <a href="https://android-arsenal.com/search?q=date+picker" rel="nofollow">https://android-arsenal.com/search?q=date+picker</a> for what you might want. </p>

<p>Note you can change the style to reflect a particular os version in the preview, by looking for for the Android icon with the number next to it, and selecting which os version you want the preview to reflect.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use a third party library, you can force the style of the datepicker by rewritting the theme style, for reference check this post out: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20835126/datepicker-with-different-style-than-activity">datepicker with different style than activity</a></p>
