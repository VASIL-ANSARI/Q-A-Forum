<p>Apart form the things mentionned in the comments, there are several other to consider revision in your code.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>$_POST['todo']</code> can be an empty string if the user has not selected an item, because there is <code>value=""</code>. In PHP and other languages an empty string evaluates to <code>false</code>. Do you want it like this ?</li>
<li>if you have data in the <code>$_POST</code> array, then there it's a good bet your <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']</code> equals '<code>POST</code>'</li>
<li>To the main point: <code>isset($_POST['S1'])</code> will always be <code>false</code>. The element with name <code>S1</code> is an <code>input</code> with type <code>submit</code>, and as such, it will be submitted <strong>ONLY</strong> if it is the submitter, ie only if it has been clicked. But with <code>e.preventDefault()</code>, you prevent that action, and the form is submitted through <code>$form.trigger('submit');</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you really need it, a solution could be to use a hidden field (<code>type="hidden"</code>).</p>

<p>For more about which elements get submitted or not, you have the main rule on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#constructing-the-form-data-set" rel="nofollow">w3's site</a>. Two other well known elements aren't submitted : radio button and checkbox if they have checkedness == <code>false</code>.</p>
