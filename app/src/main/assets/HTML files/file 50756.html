<p>I made it work after testing and making up stuff. I <strong><em>guessed</em></strong> the MoRef for both AuthManager and FileManager doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>ManagedObjectReference MoRefFileManager = new ManagedObjectReference("guestOperationsFileManager");
GuestFileManager VMFileManager = new GuestFileManager(VClient, MoRefFileManager);
ManagedObjectReference MoRefAuthManager = new ManagedObjectReference("guestOperationsAuthManager");
GuestAuthManager VMAuthManager = new GuestAuthManager(VClient, MoRefAuthManager);
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's working, and I have no idea how.</p>
