<p>Others have suggested changing your design, but it's important to understand why your original design doesn't work.</p>

<p>Your <code>BankAccount</code> class behaves a certain way when you attempt to overdraft.  That behavior is part of its implicit API.  A class that allows overdrafts breaks that API by <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/170142/145776">weakening the postcondition</a> that the balance cannot be negative.  In a sense, it <em>is not</em> a <code>BankAccount</code>.  Therefore, it should not be a subclass of <code>BankAccount</code>.  Making the class or methods <code>final</code> is Java's way of enforcing this.</p>

<p>As biziclop notes, it is possible to use inheritance to express the relationship between an account that can overdraft and one that can't.  But making either one the parent of the other breaks the Liskov Substitution Principle.  Instead, make the two classes implement or extend a common interface or superclass that does not specify the overdraft behavior.  Perhaps the superclass should not include the <code>withdraw</code> method at all.  Avoid writing one class that works both ways.  If a client of your API has to test an object's behavior and capabilities, you've circumvented the strong typing that is one of Java's greatest strengths.</p>

<p>There's a great book called <em>Effective Java</em> that every Java programmer should read.  It talks about how <a href="http://igstan.ro/posts/2011-09-09-how-inheritance-violates-encapsulation.html" rel="nofollow">inheritance breaks encapsulation</a> and how every class that allows inheritance must be designed very carefully.  For these reasons, I think it's a terrible disservice to students that inheritance is one of the first things taught in an introductory programming class.  It should be one of the last.</p>
