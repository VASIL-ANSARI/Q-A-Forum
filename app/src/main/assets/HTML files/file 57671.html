<p><code>ArrayList</code> is preferable to  <code>LinkedList</code> for the vast majority of use cases. Have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/322715/when-to-use-linkedlist-over-arraylist">this Q&amp;A</a> for a discussion on their performance difference.</p>

<p>In short, <code>ArrayList</code> have <em>amortised</em> complexity of O(1) for <code>add(Object o)</code>. They also have the benefit of having a better cache locality since all  the items are allocated in a single chunk of memory rather than being scattered all over the heap, which is quite costly since it requires extra indirection.</p>

<p>Said that, it's good that you worry about performance but if all you have to work with is a list of 1000 items you're probably going to see a little difference between the two implementations. Your list is not that big and you're also mixing operations on the list with I/O operations, which are surely going to dominate the execution time of your application.</p>
