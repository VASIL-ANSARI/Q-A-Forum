<p>Don't put brackets around your <code>if</code> statement.  When you do that, you are creating a new list.  Change it to this:</p>

<pre><code>if answer == randint:
</code></pre>

<p>You could put parentheses around it if you wanted to, but not <code>[]</code>.  Your second problem is that <code>random.randint()</code> returns an integer, but <code>input()</code> returns a string (in Python3).  You could say <code>if int(answer) == randint:</code> instead, or you could say <code>if answer == str(randint):</code>.  Your third problem, as @cricket_007 pointed out is <code>randint(0, 2)</code> will return an integer between <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>, not <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>.  Just change that line to <code>randint = random.randint(1, 10)</code>.</p>
