<p>Your log states that you don't have the permission for bluetooth. Make sure you dind't write it wrong in the manifest. Needs to be as next</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth" /&gt;

&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" /&gt; 
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure you put the permission in the wrong place within the manifest. You "MUST" write it at root level of the manifest, and "NOT" within any other tag.</p>
