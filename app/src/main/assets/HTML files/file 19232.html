<p>NOTE: I will assume that by client you mean the browser. Else, please clarify with more details.</p>

<p>Socket.io does not support binary data, mainly because it offers different transports, and many of them do not support it.</p>

<p>However, native websockets DO support Blobs and ArrayBuffers.</p>

<p>If you really want to go with binary data for efficiency (which, I agree, is the way to go in your case), I think you should consider using websockets instead of socket.io.</p>

<p>The bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only ~55% of users browse the web with a browser that supports websockets.</li>
<li>You wouldn't have the commodities socket.io offers, such as channels, emit and on methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Web sockets API is extremely simple.</p></li>
<li><p>It will be much more memory efficient. Normally your normal arrays are transferred by first making them a JSON string and then sending them back. This means you're actually sending a string representation of your array! Instead, here you will send the amount of bytes you would expect (in a more predictable manner, without checking string lengths before sending, but in a more "protocol"-ic way if desired).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Else you can just go with JSON.</p>

<p>Truth be told, if you still go with JSON for socket.io and "universal" support, enable flash transport too, and disable slower transports if the game requires low latency.</p>
