<p>Neither snippet works in C++.</p>

<p>However, in C, it's possible to use non-constant expressions as array sizes. Some compilers (for example, GCC without <code>-pedantic</code> option) support that C feature in C++ code.</p>

<p>As for the difference between element types, it's compiler-specific. GCC compiles both. clang++ prohibits non-POD types (such as <code>std::string</code>) in this case.</p>
