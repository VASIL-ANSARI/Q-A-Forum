<p>You change the tag of the switch somewhere else in the code, probably so that when the switch is changed you can get the row number from it.</p>

<p>Really you should have a custom cell which has outlets to the views so you don't need to use tags at all, and the cell should handle the switch changes to update the model or call some callback to the view controller.</p>
