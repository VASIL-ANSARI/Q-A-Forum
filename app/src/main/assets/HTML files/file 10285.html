<p>You need to fix your SQL, you are just leaving yourself open for SQL injection, with using <code>$_GET['username']</code> directly in your SQL query.</p>

<p>Please look at utilizing parameterization, also keep in mind that order counts when you develop these things. TOP -> DOWN.</p>

<p>If you have a display SQL call <strong>BEFORE</strong> your <strong>UPDATE</strong> call, then you will have to refresh again to see changes from the UPDATE SQL call.</p>
