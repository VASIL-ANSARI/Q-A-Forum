<p>It looks like you are trying to "run" the POM file in Eclipse (Run As/XSL transformation or whatever the option is) in which case Eclipse is trying to find an XSL stylesheet to transform the XML - not what you're interested in.  The POM file is a file for a tool called <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Maven</a> which specifies a project's structure, its dependencies, etc.  You first want to download Maven and run <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code> from the command line/shell which will generate all of the Eclipse meta-data files for the project (e.g. <code>.project</code>, <code>.classpath</code>, etc) and re-import your project as a Java application.  Alternatively, download the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/" rel="nofollow">m2e</a> plugin and import it as a Maven project.</p>

<p>Maven may take a bit to learn but there are many tutorials available aside from the one on the Maven site, simply google it.</p>
