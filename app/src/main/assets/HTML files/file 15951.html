<p>With that code you can only tell when a user changes to another page on your server. If he leaves to another website, or closes the tab/browser, this won't work. Use javascript instead or use a session timeout.
REQUEST_URI is the URI of the current request, so if a user changes to another page on your server, you can check that it's not the "session page" and destroy the session. this will only work if you don't use rewrite or similar techniques.</p>
