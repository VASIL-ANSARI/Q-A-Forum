<p>You're accessing the location too early. Depending on the actual state of the device, there might not be a location information there yet (as you NSLog is milli- or microconds after the <code>startUpdatingLocation</code>). The proper way to get location information is to set a <code>delegate</code> on you <code>locationManager</code>, e.g. <code>self</code> and implement this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way your app will be notified, as soon as there is a known location available.</p>
