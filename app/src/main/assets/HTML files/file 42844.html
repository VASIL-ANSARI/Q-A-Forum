<p>Mainly for testability  purpose as stated in <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$window" rel="nofollow">Doc</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While window is globally available in JavaScript, it causes
  testability problems, because it is a global variable. In angular we
  always refer to it through the $window service, so it may be
  overridden, removed or mocked for testing.</p>
