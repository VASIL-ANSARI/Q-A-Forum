<p>Use <code>filter</code> to filter out <code>nil</code> elements:</p>

<pre><code>list = list.filter { $0 != nil }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with your code is that <code>0 ..&lt; list.count</code> is executed once at the beginning of the loop, when <code>list</code> still has all of its elements. Each time you remove one element, <code>list.count</code> is decremented, but the iteration range is not modified. You end up reading too far.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Removed the C-style loop because it's incorrect (for reasons other than @MartinR pointed out before deleting his comment, but incorrect nonetheless).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> Now that Swift has <code>flatMap</code>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32729488/251153">Marcel Molina's answer</a> is better.</p>
