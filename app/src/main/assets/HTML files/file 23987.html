<p>Have a look at the query results when you change it to include the LENGTH column.</p>

<pre><code>WITH ShowMessage(STATEMENT, LENGTH)
AS
(
    SELECT  STATEMENT = CAST('I Like ' AS VARCHAR(300)), 
            LEN('I Like ')
    UNION ALL
    SELECT  CAST(STATEMENT + 'CodeProject! ' AS VARCHAR(300)), 
            LEN(STATEMENT) FROM ShowMessage
    WHERE   LENGTH &lt; 300
)
SELECT  STATEMENT,
        LENGTH
FROM    ShowMessage
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice on each recursion the length of the string gets longer.</p>

<p>The recursice loops will end once the leng grows to longer than 300</p>
