<p>Since Ruby cannot be linked against user C extensions in advance, it loads them at runtime as shared libraries. These extensions have to be loaded from somewhere, and that's exactly what <code>DLN_LIBRARY_PATH</code> specifies: the list of directories where shared objects or DLLs may be found.</p>

<p>It is similar to the <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html" rel="nofollow"><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable</a>, which provides the same information for the dynamic linker on Unix-like systems.</p>
