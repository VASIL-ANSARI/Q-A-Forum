<p>This is how I do it. Opinions and methods may vary. 
Generally speaking, I find the best way to learn about a system is to go through the code while the app is running.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a significant place in the UI (the startup screen, some other screen).</li>
<li>Find the class for that view. Generally just ask a senior developer. Developers are happy to give a pointer (no pun intended) to someone who wants to learn by himself instead of having to explain everything.</li>
<li>Place a breakpoint in that class and run the app in Xcode until you hit your breakpoint.</li>
<li>Then start tracing in there to see how things happen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the process at different spots in the app and soon you'll get a general idea of how the app works. Then it's a lot easier to catch the details.</p>

<p>If the system is really enormous (like an enterprise app that runs on multiple systems), then a diagram showing all the architecturally significant pieces would probably help. For an iOS app, it's probably not needed.</p>

<p>Good luck...</p>
