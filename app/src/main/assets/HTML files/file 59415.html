<p>There are many cases where "good OO design" allows you to go without <strong>if/else</strong> checks; most often by using some form of polymorphism. </p>

<p>Meaning: instead of asking some object about some property, to then make a decision on that in your client code, you somehow make sure that your client code can simply call a method on some other object. And then, the "if" is "hidden" within the code that initially generated that "other object" and gave it to your client code. (you find some nice examples how that works in these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0011D00849E1B79" rel="nofollow">videos</a>).</p>

<p>But - I think this would be clear overkill in this case! </p>

<p>The point is: from a readability point of view, that one check really doesn't hurt (you could refactor things into more methods maybe). And performance ... doesn't matter either. If your code is called so often that it would matter, the JIT will kick in anyway, and probably create code that that takes the correct branch directly for most cases.</p>

<p>Thus: this is a nice implementation; and I think you shouldn't worry about this one if-check there!</p>
