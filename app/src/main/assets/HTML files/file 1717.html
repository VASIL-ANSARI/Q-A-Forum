<p>When I was learning jQuery I wrote 'Simple Paint' program. This program had 100x100 div and color chooser. I could draw different things keeping left mouse button pressed. It took about 4 hours to write that program (i.e. it's very easy especially if we assume that I was learning jQuery and didn't know how to use it correctly). </p>

<p>P.S. you describe the strangest requirement I've ever heard.</p>
