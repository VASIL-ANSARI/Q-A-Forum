<p>You need to register the OnClickListener with your Views using View.setOnClickListener(). </p>

<p>EDIT:
A mediocre example of this can be found at this link:</p>

<p>page down to where it says activity and look through there. They implement their own class to do everything, but uses methods that are from the super class (and not part of the custom class) I can't promise this will for sure solve your problem though, but should be a step in the right direction.</p>
