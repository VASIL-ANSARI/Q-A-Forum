<p>I don't think there is any event tailored for that.</p>

<p>You could add you own and file a pull request / Magento ticket to include a good one.</p>

<p>Until then I think the only way is to use one of the events you found and do some checks on how far Magento is initialized. </p>

<p>Did you try to get <code>Mage::app()-&gt;getStores()</code>? This might save you from the Exception catching.</p>
