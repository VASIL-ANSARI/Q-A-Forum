<p>You can't just install Sage as a package with a package, and there is tons of non-Python code in Sage, so it would be hard to do this a priori. </p>

<p>However, you can call Sage from a script pretty easily.  <a href="http://ask.sagemath.org/question/646/using-sage-in-a-python-cgi-script">Here</a> is an example.</p>

<p>For anyone finding this, in general <a href="http://ask.sagemath.org">ask.sagemath.org</a> is going to be a quicker way to get responses - I didn't even know that stackoverflow <strong>had</strong> a Sage tag.</p>
