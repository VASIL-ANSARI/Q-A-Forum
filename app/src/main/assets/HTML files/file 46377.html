<p>Put the pattern which matches exactly four spaces inside a group and then make that group to repeat one or more times. And also you need to add a negative lookahead at the end, so that it won't match the string which has four spaces at the start followed  by another space.</p>

<pre><code>/^(?:\s{4})+(?! )/
</code></pre>
