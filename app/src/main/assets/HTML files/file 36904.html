<p>This is to do with the way Auth component works, if the "unauthorizedRedirect" property isn't set then it seems to redirect to "/{app-directory" which is your domain - hence why you end up at "yourDomain/youDomain".</p>

<p>Easiest way to fix it, in your Auth component in AppController add</p>

<pre><code>public $componens = array(
    //other components
    'Auth' =&gt; array(
        //other properties
        'unauthorizedRedirect' =&gt; 'url to redirect to' //e.g. '/'
    )
);
</code></pre>
