<p>There would be a nice solution in form of setting a breakpoint on <code>call</code> instruction, but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14032055/13767">as this answer states</a> there is no way to do that.</p>

<p>I think, the easiest solution would be to set that breakpoints manually or try to <a href="http://tromey.com/blog/?p=548" rel="nofollow">write a script in Python</a> which finds function calls in the currect function listing and sets desired breakpoints.</p>
