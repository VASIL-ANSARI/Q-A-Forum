<p>You need to actually use your connection string. </p>

<p>But first let's remove the duplicate declaration of your connection. Remove <code>Dim conn As New OleDbConnection</code> from the very top of your code (the one outside of the method) it's not needed since you are declaring again inside of the method. Then, inside the method update your connection initialization to:
        Dim conn As New OleDbConnection(connstring) </p>

<p>More than that, you need to initialize your command, passing it the connection string and query string. The Adapter needs to have a reference to the command and you need to call </p>

<pre><code>SQLAdapter.fill(Table) 
</code></pre>

<p>To get your data in the table.</p>

<p>Please look up how to use these objects... Simply creating new instances of them doesn't implicitly assign all of the configuration information that each object needs. </p>

<p>One note is to make sure that you dispose your objects that implement the IDisposable interface to free the unmanaged resources. It is not enough to simply close your connection--this will lead to memory leaks, not just with SQL objects but anything that uses resources not directly managed by. .NET</p>

<pre><code> SQLCommand.dispose() 
 SQLAdapter.dispose() 
 Table.dispose() 
 conn.dispose() 
 conn.close() 
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, once you get it working using the information provided above and some googling, you then need to address SQLInjection. Right now your query string is prone to injection whereas a user could potentially type some malicious text into the text box you refer to in your query string and manipulate your database without your permission. To get around this, look into parameterized commands.</p>

<p>I'm posting from my phone or else I'd provide a full working set of code; but at the same time I don't want to rewrite the whole thing for you. There should be enough info in this answer to help you do a little research. </p>

<p>This MSDN page contains info on the OleDb data adapter as well as a short example at the end. It also includes links and references for the rest of the OleDb classes and to some tutorials:

<p>This MSDN page contains info on the SQLDataAdapter and includes a short example at the very bottom. Although a different class, the usage is fundamentally the same as the OleDb classes: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx</a></p>

<p>Though not in vb (its in c#) the usage is the same,  just slightly different syntax (best I could find from my phone at the moment). Again this is for the SQLDataAdapter class, but usage is fundamentally the same: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/462730/Five-different-overloads-of-the-DataAdapter-Fill-m" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/462730/Five-different-overloads-of-the-DataAdapter-Fill-m</a></p>
