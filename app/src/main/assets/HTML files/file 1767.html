<p>Yes, it's certainly painful to lower-case several objects for each loop iteration (plus a possibly redundant <code>toString</code>?), and also bad practice to call <code>list.size()</code> for every iteration &mdash; that value should be cached before the loop starts.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you're working with this much data, is there a reason that you're not using an SQLite database for storage and displaying/filtering your list using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CursorAdapter.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CursorAdapter</code></a>?</p>

<p>That would be the recommended way to implement something of this size.</p>
