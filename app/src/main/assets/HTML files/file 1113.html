<p>I tend to create a dedicated user for each rails app I run and install, and add that user to the <code>www-data</code> group. So, I tend to have <code>/home/mephisto/www</code>, <code>/home/warehouse/www</code> and so on.</p>

<p>I do this purely for organization, and I don't think it matters much.</p>
