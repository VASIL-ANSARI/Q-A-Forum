<p>First, create a 2-Dimensional Array (or list or whatever) with a String and a integer. Now you can loop through each line and do following:</p>

<p>Cut out the "ROBxx" String and save it as String.</p>

<p>Check the 2-Dimensional Array for the String. if you found it, increase the count. If not already in the Array, add it and set the count to 1.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
