<p>I think that you might want to use a Div to surround that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, have you tried that?</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Here is what I did</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Removed style <code>clear:left</code> from <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>added 4 <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> before the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>added a style of <code>margin-top:100px</code>  to `<p></p></li>
</ol>

<p>here are the results
personally i think all the code is a little messy it was a little hard to read. but I am spoiled that way.</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong>
in the Fiddle I Moved the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> Tag Above and Outside of the <code>&lt;div class="melonhtml5_gallery"&gt;</code> tag  </p>

<p>the cube that has the word testing on it, is not so much a cube so the spacing is off.
that looks like something that will need to be addressed in the code for the Cubes itself.</p>

<p>otherwise it is as you wish now.</p>

<p><em><strong>LAST EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>you really need to clarify your question.</strong>  </p>

<p>do you want a single heading for all cubes in that section, like <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/8CtGE/3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/8CtGE/3/</a>  ? if this is so you should start with the basics of HTML and CSS before Tackling something as complex as what you are doing with the cubes.  I hope that I am not sounding Rude, but someone needs to tell you that what I have done is <strong>Basic HTML/CSS Editing</strong></p>
