<p>This PHP code is running on the web server that your iOS app is connecting to (this code is <em>not</em> running in the iOS device, itself), so <code>localhost</code> is fine. </p>

<p>This iOS device does, though, need to interact with the web service, though, so as you write your <code>NSURLConnection</code>, <code>NSURLSession</code>, or AFNetworking code, that's where you need to worry about the IP address or name of the web service. (And, if connecting via WiFi, you could temporarily use the IP number or name of your computer that you see in the "sharing" section in the Mac's system preferences. If connecting via cellular, it's more complicated.)</p>

<hr>

<p>In your revised question, you reference a host variable. That's where you supply your IP number:</p>

<pre><code>#define kAPIHost @"http://192.168.0.5/folder/"
</code></pre>

<p>Frankly, that should make you as queasy as the idea of using a fixed IP number in your PHP code, but this is just something you're using during your development.</p>

<p>If you go to your computer's "system preferences" and look at "sharing", it will give you a name you could use here, instead. For example, mine is:</p>

<pre><code>#define kAPIHost @"http://Robs-iMac.local/folder/"
</code></pre>

<p>Yours will differ, but you get the idea. Of course, replace "folder" and <code>kAPIPath</code> with the appropriate values.</p>

<p>And remember, this only works if your iOS device is connecting via wifi. To connect remotely is more complicated, and frankly when you get to that point, you might just want to invest in some web hosting service, and move your PHP code onto that ISP's servers.</p>
