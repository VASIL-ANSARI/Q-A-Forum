<p>Well, the message is accurate.  CreateItemMoniker is imported from ole32.dll, not from "crtdll.dll".  Which in itself is an odd DLL name, it dates back to the 16-bit version of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>You are linking an invalid import library.  That possibly started with "libx264.a", that's a library that was created by the GCC toolchain.  You have to link to ole32.lib to get a proper reference for CreateItemMoniker.</p>
