<p>The issue is related to the version of the Hot Tuna Starter pack I installed. I installed version 3.0.12. </p>

<p>When I replaced the Cirrious.MVVM and Cirrious.MVVM.Droid dll's located at packages\MvvmCross.HotTuna.MvvmCrossLibraries.3.0.12\lib\MonoAndroid16 with the dll's from the Hot Tuna Starter pack V3.0.9 everything started working fine. (I also tested 3.0.4 which worked fine too)</p>

<p>I did not test V3.0.10 and v3.0.11. I also tested v 3.0.13 BETA, but it is still broken.</p>
