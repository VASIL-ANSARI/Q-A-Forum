<p>Having unused <code>use</code> statements in PHP doesn't impact performance. At least not in any noticeable measure.</p>

<p>Two statements you mention, however are used. They are used for annotation routing, eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;


class MyController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/some/route")
     */
    public function someAction()
    {
        // ...
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>So if you are using them in annotations, you'll need them. If you aren't you can safely remove them.</p>

<p>You can technically use annotations without those use statements too but it looks terribly ugly:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyController
{
    /**
     * @Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route("/some/route")
     */
    public function someAction()
    {
        // ...
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<h3>If you are using PHPStorm</h3>

<p>If you are using PHPStorm IDE, you can install <strong>PHP Annotations</strong> plugin. It will recognize them and mark those two statements as <strong>used</strong> if you use them through annotations.</p>
