<p>Considering you are saving the records into the same database as your form, it seems that you need to discount using <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>, which is what I'd normally use with Paperclip</p>

<p><strong>Saving Multiple Records At Once</strong></p>

<p>It seems your main problem is saving multiple records at once:</p>

<pre><code>No handler found for {"0"=&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that Rails is not able to compute the save function, as it's only designed for single params. You'll actually have to save the records with a manual SQL query, like these resources:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8505263/how-to-implement-bulk-insert-in-rails-3">How to implement bulk insert in Rails 3</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, you somehow have to loop through your params array, and save the data in one bulk way. Here is one way you could do it:</p>

<p>As per one of those links, you could use the <strong><a href="https://github.com/zdennis/activerecord-import" rel="nofollow"><code>activerecord-import</code></a></strong> gem</p>

<pre><code>def create
assets = []
    params[:asset].each do |k,v| 
       assets &lt;&lt; Asset.new(params[:asset][k])
    end
    Asset.import assets
end
</code></pre>
