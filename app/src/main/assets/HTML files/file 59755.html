<p>UnitySendMessage cannot return anything to Android.</p>

<p>One way you could do this is implement another method in Android that Unity will pass the value back to when requested.</p>

<p>So for example, first in android you request the data:</p>

<pre><code>UnityPlayer.UnitySendMessage("ProfileSave", "getData");
</code></pre>

<p>In unity you have a method that receives that request and sends the data back to android:</p>

<pre><code>public void getData () { 
    string dataString = "exampleData";
    //code to send data back to ReceiveData method in Android, something like this probably:
    AndroidJavaClass myAndroidClass = new AndroidJavaClass ("com.myCompany.myApplication.myClass");
    myAndroidClass.CallStatic ("ReceiveData",dataString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in android you have a method waiting to receive the data (most likely a static method):</p>

<pre><code>public static void ReceiveData(string data){
     //do stuff with data
}
</code></pre>
