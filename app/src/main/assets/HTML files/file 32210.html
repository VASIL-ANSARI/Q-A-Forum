<h1>How do I create a custom archive page that my client can edit?</h1>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<ol>
<li>I created a page called archive-mycustomposttype.php which wordpress automatically uses as the archive page for your custom post type, if it exists. </li>
<li>I then created a new section in wordpress's customizer and added controls with text, textarea and image settings. </li>
<li>I called the saved values via  in the archive-customposttype.php template.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps </p>
