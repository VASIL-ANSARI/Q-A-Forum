<p>This is because the Spring framework used to return a raw list declaration and that raw list declaration basically allows you to declare any type you want. If you do that, the compiler will issue a warning that can be "ignored" with a <code>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")</code> declaration.</p>

<p>While backward compatibility could have been provided for this, many references suggest to never use raw lists in "new code".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of genericity into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types.</p>

<p>While I can certainly understand the benefit of what you used to be able to do, I would advise you to update your code as you did, yes: you were doing an <em>implicit</em> cast previously anyway.</p>
