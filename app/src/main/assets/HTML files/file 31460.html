<p>In your constructor for Employee, you're assigning to local variables, not to the fields of the same name.</p>

<pre><code>Employee( String firstName1, String lastName1, String street1, String city1, String state1, String zipcode1, int month1, int day1, int year1, int employeeID1 ) {
    name name = new name( firstName1, lastName1 );
    address address = new address( street1, city1, state1, zipcode1 );
    date date = new date( month1, day1, year1);
    employeeID = employeeID1;   
} 
</code></pre>

<p>You can eliminate this problem by removing the type names from the assignment statements:</p>

<pre><code>Employee( String firstName1, String lastName1, String street1, String city1, String state1, String zipcode1, int month1, int day1, int year1, int employeeID1 ) {
    name = new name( firstName1, lastName1 );
    address = new address( street1, city1, state1, zipcode1 );
    date = new date( month1, day1, year1);
    employeeID = employeeID1;   
} 
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, you should consider beginning all your type names with an uppercase character. This is almost universal Java style, and helps you identify them at a glance.</p>

<pre><code>class Name { ... }
class Date { ... }
class Address { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>One way to reduce the likelihood of name collisions between member and local variables is to adopt a different naming scheme for the former. This is not generally accepted Java style, and some feel antipathy toward it as an incursion of a style that originated in C++. However, it can reduce risk.</p>

<pre><code>class Employee {
    int m_employeeID = 0;
    Name m_name;
    Address m_address;
    Date m_date;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
