<p>In both options you are overwriting the dictionary on every iteration. You should initilize it only once outside the loop. For the first option it will look like:</p>

<pre><code>phone_contacts = {}             # this line moved from inside the loop

while condition == True:
    print("Menu")
    print("contacts")
    print("Add contacts")
    print("Remove contacts")

                                # the line deleted from here

    # ...
</code></pre>
