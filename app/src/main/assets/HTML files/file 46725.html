<p>Since you have an autoincrement field (let's assume for this case its called record_id) you can use this little trick to achieve what you want:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Main.id, Main.spentHours,
(
    SELECT SUM(spentHours) 
    FROM Table1 WHERE Table1.id = Main.id
    AND Table1.record_id &gt;= Main.record_id
) as totalSpentHours
FROM Table1 Main
ORDER BY Main.record_id ASC
</code></pre>

<p>This will fetch the id, current spent hours, along using a subselect, all hours from the current ID and above for that user.</p>
