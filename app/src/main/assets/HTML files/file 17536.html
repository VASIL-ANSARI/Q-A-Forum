<p>You want to use a <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects">session</a>:</p>

<pre><code>s = requests.session()

response = s.get('url')
</code></pre>

<p>You use the session just like the <code>requests</code> module (it has the same methods), but it'll retain cookies for you and send them along on future requests.</p>
