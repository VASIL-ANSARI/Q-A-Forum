<p>The validation is failing because after your converter converts the String representation of AssessmentType back to an object, JSF iterates over the existing values (<code>assessmentBean.assessment.type.fields</code>) and compares this recently converted object with all those existing ones.</p>

<p>Since you did not implement <code>Object#equals</code> for AssessmentType, it will default to an object identity comparison (roughly spoken, the memory address of your object) , which will of course fail.</p>

<p>The solution is thus to either implement <code>Object#equals</code>, or let the converter get the object from <code>assessmentBean.assessment.type.fields</code> instead of from <code>AssessmentTypeManager</code>.</p>
