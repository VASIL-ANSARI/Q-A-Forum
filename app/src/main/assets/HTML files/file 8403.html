<p>Profile using Instruments so that you understand why your app is taking so long to start. Try to avoid doing anything that's not absolutely necessary at launch, particularly those tasks that take the longest. Defer those tasks until they're actually needed, or move them to a background thread, or both. Jobs like downloading data can usually be done quite effectively in the background.</p>
