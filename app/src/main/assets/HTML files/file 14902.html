<p>Your node.js application still has to serve it - it does not get served automagically. What do you have in your server? It should be something like</p>

<pre><code>var app = require('express').createServer();                                    
var io = require('socket.io').listen(app);
</code></pre>

<p>or similar (the <code>listen</code> is important). The location is not a real location on the disk - socket.io library should intercept the URL and serve its clientside library, as far as I understand.</p>
