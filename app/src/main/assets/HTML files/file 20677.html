<p>The <code>DllImportAttribute</code> only imports C-style DLLs into the CLI.</p>

<p>That would mean that NfcReader.dll is a standard C/++ dll and you should be able to use it however one typically uses dlls in C/++.  I've never done C/++ but I would assume <code>LoadLibrary()</code> would be a good place to start.</p>
