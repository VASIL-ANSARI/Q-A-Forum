<p>Is this your own library?  If so you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k7xkk3e2%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">generate a link map</a> that describes the layout of the code in the library, which would give you the info you need here in a more friendly form.</p>

<p>If you don't have source code access to do this, you could use Perl or other open-source scripting tools to crack the <code>dumpbin</code> output.</p>

<p>EDIT: you could also give LibDump a spin, it's downloadable from <a href="http://www.gpoulose.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I have not used this myself.</p>
