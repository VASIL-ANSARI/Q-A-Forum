<p>In broad terms, you would create an instance of an <code>Entry</code> widget for each square in the puzzle. You should then use the <code>grid</code> geometry manager to lay the widgets out in a grid. You can do both the creation and the layout in a loop for the columns nested in a loop for the rows. </p>

<p>You can use the <code>insert</code> and <code>get</code> methods to insert and retrieve the data in each widget. Or, you can associate a <code>Tkinter.IntVar</code> variable with each entry and then use the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods to get and set the value.</p>
