<p>This unicode issue look confusing at first, but it's actually pretty easy.</p>

<pre><code># -- coding: utf-8 --
</code></pre>

<p>If you write this on top of your source code, It means, python is going to
treat your code as utf-8, but not incoming or outgoing data.</p>

<p>You obviously want to write some data to your database, and this error happens
when some of your module encoding your utf-8 string (which is I guess swedish) to ascii.</p>

<p>That means, either MySQL was set as ascii or your mysql db driver is set as ascii.</p>

<p>So I suggest go check your mysql setting or driver setting.</p>

<pre><code>db = MySQLdb.connect(host=database_host ,user=user ,passwd=pass,db=database_name, charset = "utf8", use_unicode = True)
</code></pre>

<p>This will make your mysql driver connect to mysql server using utf8</p>
