<p>just add an alias to your <code>img</code> subdomain and keep the same structure. This way if you need to change in the future it will be transparent</p>

<h2>edit:</h2>

<p>is also good to have more than one subdomain for assets. like <code>img01</code> <code>img02</code> and so on. But be these subdomains consistent.</p>

<p>like if you have the image <code>image1.jpg</code> that targets to</p>

<p><code>http://img01.domain.com/images/image1.jpg</code></p>

<p>the next time the imagen appears in the code should appear as</p>

<p><code>http://img01.domain.com/images/image1.jpg</code></p>

<p>AND NOT as</p>

<p><code>http://img02.domain.com/images/image1.jpg</code></p>

<p><strong>so the cache can optimize the calls</strong>.</p>

<p>I usually use this formula</p>

<pre><code>  return sprintf("http://img%02s.domain.com", abs(crc32($imagename) % (9)));
</code></pre>

<p>this way the subdomain will be always consistent with the image name</p>

<p>Browsers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985431/max-parallel-http-connections-in-a-browser/985704#985704">limit the amount of connection</a> opens peer server. So by having multiple subdomains you are <code>faking</code> this and therefore improving the load speed of the page. </p>

<p>But in the other hand if for a same image you load it from <code>more</code> than one different server the browser's cache can't operate because it doesn't know that you want to load the same image.</p>

<p>So by hashing the image name you are obtaining <strong>always</strong> the same server and then obtaining the best of both worlds: more connections opens <strong>AND</strong> browser caching</p>
