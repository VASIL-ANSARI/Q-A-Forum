<p>The term "Unicode" refers to the standard, not to a particular encoding.
Since files in computers are binary, there exist different ways of encoding Unicode data in binary files.  One of them is "UTF-8".</p>

<p>You can consult <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html</a></p>

<p>An example taken from this document (in the section "Reading and Writing Unicode Data")</p>

<pre><code>with open('unicode.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  for line in f:
    print(repr(line))
</code></pre>

<p>In python 3, unlike python2, unicode string constants are not written with a "u".</p>
