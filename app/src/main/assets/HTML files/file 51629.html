<p>OK, I think I got it. </p>

<p>First, you cannot "store events in a Dictionary"  or in anything else. An <code>event</code> is (a kind of) a property and cannot be stored by reference. Your dictionary stores the content of those properties, delegates.</p>

<p>What happens is:</p>

<ol>
<li>You subscribe UselessHandler through reflection</li>
<li>You fill the dictionary with the initializer <code>{ EventType.Initialize, this.OnInitialize },</code></li>
<li>You subscribe another handler from the calling class with <code>+=</code></li>
<li>You raise an 'event' through the dictionary.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that at step 2) you <em>think</em> that you are capturing an event. But you are only reading the event and storing the delegate value at that moment (containing only the Useless handler)</p>

<p>In step 3) you subscribe to the actual event, nothing inside the dictionary changes</p>

<p>In step 4) only the delegate in the dictionary is invoked, not the updated delegate in the event. </p>
