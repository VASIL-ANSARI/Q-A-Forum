<p>Apparently, this was a <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12148" rel="nofollow">known bug</a> and is <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12032" rel="nofollow">fixed</a> in new <strong>2.1.0</strong> release. </p>

<p>I've confirmed that this release indeed solves the issue.</p>
