<p>You can either use raw files or modules such as <code>pickle</code> to store data easily.</p>

<pre><code>import cPickle as pickle
from quippy import Potential
try:  # try previously calculated value
    with open('/tmp/pot_store.pkl') as store:
        pot = pickle.load(store)
except OSError:  # fall back to calculating it from scratch
    pot = quippy.Potential("Potential  xml_label=gap_h2o_2b_ccsdt_3b_ccsdt",param_filename="gp.xml")
    with open('/tmp/pot_store.pkl', 'w') as store:
        pot = pickle.dump(pot, store)
</code></pre>

<p>There are various optimizations to this, e.g. checking whether your pickle file is older than the file generating it's value.</p>
