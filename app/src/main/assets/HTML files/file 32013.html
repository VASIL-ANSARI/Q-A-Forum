<p>Ok so I have found a solution. </p>

<p>I created a new UserControl: ConfirmationButton with a dependency ICommand property for if the confirmation passed. In the control I manually fire the command if the MessagBox Returns Yes. I then use this new UserControl where I need such functionality.</p>
