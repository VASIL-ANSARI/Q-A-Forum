<p>You asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I implement gesture recogniser that inherits from <code>UISwipeGestureRecognizer</code> and add logic to the <code>UIEvent</code> handlers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/GestureRecognizer_basics/GestureRecognizer_basics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009541-CH2-SW44" rel="nofollow">Creating a Custom Gesture Recognizer</a> in the <em>Event Handling Guide for iOS.</em> Also see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/?id=121" rel="nofollow">WWDC 2010 session 121 - Advanced Gesture Recognition</a>. It probably depends upon what you want to do, though, and you should see if you can accomplish what you want by configuring the standard swipe gesture's <code>direction</code> and <code>numberOfTouches</code> parameters. I've done more subclassing on continuous gestures like <code>UIPanGestureRecognizer</code>, but I see no reason why you couldn't do it on a swipe, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I implement <code>UIGestureRecognizer</code> without attaching it to a <code>UIView</code>? Meaning, I will analyze and manage the <code>UIEvent</code> events and call the proper selector (<code>touchesBegan</code>, <code>touchesMoved</code>, <code>touchesEnded</code>, <code>touchesCancelled</code>)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Obviously you can create one, but it just won't receive any of the events until it's added to a <code>UIView</code> and that view receives touches.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the meantime I have problems reseting the gesture recogniser when the state is <code>UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'd have to submit a new question providing a relevant code snippet for us to help you on that one. In general, you'd do any post-gesture cleanup when your handler is called for <code>UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded</code> (and <code>UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled</code> or <code>UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed</code>) and you'd initialize everything for the next gesture when you receive the next <code>UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan</code>.</p>
