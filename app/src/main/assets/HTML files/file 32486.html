<p>Do you have locale correctly set up?</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Table_of_locales" rel="nofollow">table of locales</a>, the persian should be probably Farsi - <code>fa_IR.UTF-8</code> from the package <code>fa_utf8</code>. Don't forget to check if it has been set correctly too:</p>

<pre><code>$rv = setlocale(LC_ALL, "fa_IR.UTF-8");
var_dump($rv);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> tried it and it doesn't seem to help either.</p>
