<p>If I understand you correctly, you just want to get the total score for the second highest student, and student is identified by roll? If so:</p>

<pre><code>select roll, sum(Marks) from Student group by roll order by total limit 1,1;
</code></pre>

<p>Not 100% sure about the 1,1 - what you are saying is, I only want 1 row, and not the first. </p>
