<p>I don't think there's a "drop in folder and it just works" solution for Laravel, but Packages is probably the closest to what you are describing:</p>

<p><a href="http://laravel.com/docs/packages" rel="nofollow">http://laravel.com/docs/packages</a></p>

<p>Usually after you install a package, you run an <code>artisan</code> command to publish configurations and potentially run some database migrations, and then you're good to go.</p>

<p>I would start there if you want to create some additional self-contained functionality without wading into the existing site..</p>
