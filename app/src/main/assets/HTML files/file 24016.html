<p>To get transitive dependency resolution, you'll have to upload a dependency descriptor (POM for a Maven repository, <code>ivy.xml</code> for an Ivy repository) for each Jar. </p>

<p>When you manually upload a Jar, Artifactory offers to generate a basic descriptor, which you can edit to fill in the dependency information.</p>

<p>When you build and publish a Jar with Gradle, Gradle will automatically generate and upload a descriptor containing dependency information according to the dependencies specified in the build script. If necessary, the generated descriptor can be further customized in the build script. See "8.6. Publishing artifacts" in the <a href="http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide_single.html" rel="nofollow">Gradle User Guide</a>.</p>
