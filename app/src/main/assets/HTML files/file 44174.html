<p>Browsers parse HTML and build a element tree from that; in that process they'll insert elements that may be missing from the input HTML document.</p>

<p>In this case, the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> elements <em>are not in the source HTML</em>. Your browser inserts them because they are implied in the structure if missing. LXML doesn't insert them however.</p>

<p>Your browser tools are not the best tools to build XPath queries for this reason.</p>

<p>Removing the <code>tbody/</code> path elements produces the results you are looking for:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sect_p = '//*[@id="yfncsumtab"]/tr[2]/td[1]/table[2]/tr/td/table/tr[1]/td/a/text()'
&gt;&gt;&gt; indu_p = '//*[@id="yfncsumtab"]/tr[2]/td[1]/table[2]/tr/td/table/tr[2]/td/a/text()'
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.xpath(sect_p)
['Consumer Goods']
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.xpath(indu_p)
['Electronic Equipment']
</code></pre>
