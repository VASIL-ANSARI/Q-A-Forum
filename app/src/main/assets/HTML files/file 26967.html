<p>As far as I am aware, the correct syntax for the media query is:</p>

<pre><code>@media screen { .dropdown li a { font-size: 12px; } }
</code></pre>

<p>This should solve your problem.</p>

<p>See these fiddles, the first uses the correct media query syntax:</p>

<p>The next uses the incorrect syntax used by your example</p>

<p>In additon, here is a little on CSS specifity for anyone who isn't sure how it works:</p>

<p>CSS specifity follows a ruleset and produces a score for each selector.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://specificity.keegan.st/" rel="nofollow">calculator tools</a> available which will explain the specifity value for any give rule.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity</a> says that the following rules are used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A selector's specificity is calculated as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>count 1 if the declaration is from is a 'style' attribute rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= a) (In HTML, values of an
  element's "style" attribute are style sheet rules. These rules have no
  selectors, so a=1, b=0, c=0, and d=0.)</li>
  <li>count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= b)</li>
  <li>count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= c)</li>
  <li>count the number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= d) </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The specificity is based only on the form of the selector. In
  particular, a selector of the form "[id=p33]" is counted as an
  attribute selector (a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0), even if the id attribute is
  defined as an "ID" in the source document's DTD.</p>
