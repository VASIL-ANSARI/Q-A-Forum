<p>I'd take the library at <a href="http://json.org/java/" rel="nofollow">http://json.org/java/</a>, and modify the <code>equals</code> method of JSONObject and JSONArray to do a deep equality test. To make sure that it works regradless of the order of the children, all you need to do is replace the inner map with a <code>TreeMap</code>, or use something like <code>Collections.sort()</code>.</p>
