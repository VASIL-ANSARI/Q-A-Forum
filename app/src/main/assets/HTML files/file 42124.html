<p>This would be the correct solution without memory leak</p>

<pre><code>private int i = 0;
private int stop = 15; //number of times I want the motor to stop
private Timer bTimer; //initialise timer -&gt; Thats wrong: nothing is INITIALIZED here its just defined

private void btnGo_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) //On click
{
    i = 0;
    stop = Convert.ToInt32(tbIntervalStops.Text); //using int because double is a floating point number like 12.34 and for counting only full numbers will be needed

    bTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(waittime); //time I want the motor to wait + Here the Timer is INITIALIZED

    bTimer.Elapsed += PerformMove; //Adds the Eventhandler, What should be called when the time is over
    bTimer.Enabled = true; //This starts the timer. It enables running like pressing the start button on a stopwatch

}

private void PerformMove(Object source, ElapsedEventArgs e) //event to move motor
{
    //movemotor
    i++;

    if (i == stop) //if stop would be a double here we will have the danger to get not a true because of rounding problems
    {
        bTimer.Stop();
        //now enable the Garbage Collector to remove the Timer instance 
        bTimer.Elapsed -= PerformMove; //This removes the Eventhandler
        bTimer.Dispose(); //This frees all resources held by the Timer instance.  
        bTimer = null; 
    }
}
</code></pre>
