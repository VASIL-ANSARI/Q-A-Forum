<p>As Martijn notes, this type of log would be complicated to manage, and maybe inefficient (though this may or may not concern you).</p>

<p>A simple way to solve some part of the inefficiency is to use fixed record lengths. I.e. make each log entry the same (max) length.</p>

<p>Another way is to make your log database-based, and just make a record (variable or not) for each log entry. Let the db manager handle the adjustments. There are simple (RAM-based) databases to real, disk-based ones, all of which you can access with Python.</p>

<p>Yet another solution, if you're happy with a memory based log, is look into FIFO files.</p>
