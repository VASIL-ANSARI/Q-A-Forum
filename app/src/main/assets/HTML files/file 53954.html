<p>Why exactly do you want entirely separate DB files for each customer?</p>

<p>In any case this is easier with straight SQLAlchemy. You can create a getter function which returns a session pointing to your db file.</p>

<pre><code>def get_session(customer_id):
    sqlite_url = 'sqlite:////path/customer%s.db' % customer_id
    engine = create_engine(sqlite_url)

    # initialize the db if it hasn't yet been initialized
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    return session
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use and close that session.</p>

<p>But without knowing your specific use case, it is difficult to understand why you would want to do this instead of just using a single SQLite database.</p>
