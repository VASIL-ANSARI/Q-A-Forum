<p>If you want a set of tests, use <code>std::vector&lt;std::function&lt;void()&gt;&gt; tests;</code> and then you can simply <code>tests.push_back([=] { do_test(the_args, I_captured, from_local, scope); });</code>.</p>

<p>You can do similar tricks with <code>std::bind</code> if your compiler doesn't support lambdas.</p>

<p>There's no need for you, the end-user, to write your own generic function interface. It already has been done.</p>

<p>Edit: Yes, you're going to end up with some C-style garbage if you do not A) re-implement the wheels provided by Boost or the STL or B) use the existing wheels provided by Boost or STL. There is no magical third choice between "Write own good code" or "Use other people's good code" which still results in good code.</p>
