<p>There may be different ways to approach this problem depending on the way you've architected your application. If you're using user control views and depending on code-behind your easiest route may be to call the security object's methods directly from the code behind and set properties directly on the controls in question.</p>

<p>If you're using MVVM or you're just not a fan of code-behind, another way around this problem may be to ditch using the name of the button and go with an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749011.aspx" rel="nofollow">attached property</a>. Attached properties are a way of using the WPF dependency property framework to store data about an object or control that the object or control didn't originally declare itself.</p>

<p>Along with attached properties comes a concept called attached behaviors. Essentially, when you create an attached property, you're given a hook for a callback that's called whenever the property is set on an object. When this callback is called, you receive the object the property was set on as well as new and old values for the property.</p>

<p>You can use the callback as an opportunity to check the value of the property against your security object and set the enabled and visible properties as you see fit.</p>
