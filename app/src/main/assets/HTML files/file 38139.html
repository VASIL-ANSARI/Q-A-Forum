<p>Yes, you can overide the ContentType in your encoder to control what is being sent. Then you can choose if you want to delegate to the inner encoder or supply your own value.</p>

<pre><code>public override string ContentType
{
    get
    {
        //return this.inner.ContentType;
        //return "text/xml";
    }
}
</code></pre>
