<p>In the Kinect v2, Microsoft increased the field of view and removed the tilt motor; so it's not possible to adjust the elevation angle anymore. But the good news is that with the expanded field of view, you can see as much as the Kinect 1 without having to move the sensor.</p>

<p>Look at this article, there is a table that clearly shows that Kinect 2 has no tilt motor: <a href="http://zugara.com/how-does-the-kinect-2-compare-to-the-kinect-1" rel="nofollow">http://zugara.com/how-does-the-kinect-2-compare-to-the-kinect-1</a>.</p>

<p>This article mentions it too, although the author missed the fact that the expanded field of view removes the need for the tilt motor: <a href="http://123kinect.com/everything-kinect-2-one-place/43136/" rel="nofollow">http://123kinect.com/everything-kinect-2-one-place/43136/</a>.</p>

<p>This one highlights that fact: <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/next-xbox-leak-reveals-kinect-2-specs/0114096" rel="nofollow">http://www.develop-online.net/news/next-xbox-leak-reveals-kinect-2-specs/0114096</a>.</p>
