<p>These are semantically different. If <code>Truth</code> is <code>null</code>, the cast will fail with an <code>InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value</code>. The second one will not fail and just execute if the value has <code>true</code> in it. Unless <code>null</code> should be an invalid value at this point in your program, go with the second version.</p>
