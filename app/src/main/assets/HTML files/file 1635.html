<p>Generally when you see nested functions warnings, what you really have is a syntax error. </p>

<p><strike>Is <code>pointidx</code> an integer and <code>balls</code> an NSArray? Also, do you have a property for balls? Try just <code>balls</code> instead of <code>self.balls</code>.</p>

<p>Edit:
Since it's a compile time thing, I'm thinking maybe it doesn't like passing <code>center</code> to NSObject. What happens if you cast the object: </p>

<pre><code>CGPoint pos=[(UIView *)([self.balls objectAtIndex:pointidx]) center];
</code></pre>

<p></strike>
Irrelevant musing obfuscated.</p>
