<p>I've worked with this data before, and found that they have an FTP site: <a href="ftp://ftp.epa.gov/dmdnload/" rel="nofollow">ftp://ftp.epa.gov/dmdnload/</a>.  Does this contain what you're looking for?  For data like that on hourly emissions, it's possible to automatically construct the URLs (year + state + month) and then download directly via wget, curl, etc.</p>
