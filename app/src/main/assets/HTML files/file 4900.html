<p>The notification should only appear once per key pressed. At least that is what I get when testing. The only thing I can think of is that you are calling <code>addObserver:selector:name:object:</code> three times. </p>

<p>Perhaps you are doing it in several view controllers and forget to call <code>removeObserver:name:object:</code>?</p>

<p>Or you are calling <code>addObserver:selector:name:object:</code> in a function that gets called several times? <code>viewDidLoad</code> is normally a good place to put code like this.  </p>
