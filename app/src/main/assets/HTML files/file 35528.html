<p>Why not try Ruby 2.0+ to do the rake task as it's default encoding is UTF-8 :) BTW, you can use <a href="https://github.com/vertiginous/pik" rel="nofollow">pik</a> to switch your ruby version under windows.</p>

<p>I got the same error when testing under ruby 1.9.3 with rails 4.0.0. And it is working for me to add<code># encoding: utf-8</code> to the first line of the related model file as I also have UTF-8 string in it. For example:</p>

<p><em>seeds.rb</em></p>

<pre><code># coding: utf-8
...
Project.create({:name=&gt;"#{UTF8_char}"})
</code></pre>

<p><em>model/project.rb</em></p>

<pre><code># coding: utf-8
...
str = "#{another_UTF8_char}"
</code></pre>

<p>Just try it.</p>
