<p>Well, since you are using a method that is almost documented (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/AddingCustomEditMenuItems/AddingCustomEditMenuItems.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/AddingCustomEditMenuItems/AddingCustomEditMenuItems.html</a>) I don't think there will be any issue with the app being rejected or whatever...</p>

<p>As the documentation says :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The edit menu is a contextual menu that is displayed to offer commands
  that can be performed on a selection such as a word in a text view or
  an image. The edit menu is an integral part of copy, cut, and paste
  operations, for which it displays (potentially) the commands Copy,
  Cut, Paste, Select, and Select All. However, you can add custom menu
  items to the edit menu to perform other kinds of actions on
  selections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the word </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>potentially</p>
</blockquote>

<p>might help you decide whether or not to do it. I would think you'd have no problem using the <code>@selector</code> stuff for disabling the copy/paste commands...</p>

<p>Furthermore, this question </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>disabling copy/paste</p>
</blockquote>

<p>has been asked so many times and nobody even cared about saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>be careful, this will prevent your app from being approved on the
  App Store</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as I said, I personally do not think this will cause any issue.</p>
