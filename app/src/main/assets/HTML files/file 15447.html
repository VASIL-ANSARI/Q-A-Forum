<p>I solved it ...I needed a <code>qualify</code> and a <code>partition by</code></p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT ID as V_ID from IDS) a
    LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT ID, NAME, COUNT(*) AS COUNTER
    FROM NAMES
    GROUP BY ID
    qualify ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY COUNTER DESC) = 1
    )b
    ON a.ID = b.ID
    LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT ID, ADDRESS, COUNT(*) AS COUNTER
    FROM ADDRESSES
    GROUP BY ID
    qualify ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY COUNTER DESC) = 1
    ) c
    ON c.ID = a.ID
</code></pre>
