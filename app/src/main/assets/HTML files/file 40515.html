<p>Just read all of lines with <code>readlines()</code> function and then you can get the n last line with reverse indexing : <code>lines[-n:]</code> and as says in comment its better to call the built-in <code>list</code> of open file handle !  </p>

<pre><code>with open('test_file.txt','r') as f :
 lines =list(f)
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>with open('test_file.txt','r') as f :
 lines =f.readlines()
</code></pre>
