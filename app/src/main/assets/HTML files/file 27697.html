<p>Oracle selects the <code>root row(s)</code> of the hierarchy (those rows that satisfy the START WITH condition.)
Oracle selects the child rows of each root row. 
Each child row must satisfy the condition of the <code>CONNECT BY</code> condition with respect to one of the root rows.</p>

<p>To find the children of a parent row, Oracle evaluates the PRIOR expression of the CONNECT BY condition for the parent row and the other expression for each row in the table. 
Rows for which the condition is true are the children of the parent. 
The <code>CONNECT BY</code> condition can contain other conditions to further filter the rows selected by the query.</p>

<pre><code>A root row is the highest row within an inverted tree. 
</code></pre>

<p>If you try with same parent as child (22 or 33 or 44) it will work since they are not root rows and just parents
Since 1 is the root and also a child with 1, the LEVEL is set to be cycle due to CONNECT_BY_ROOT clause</p>

<p>The duplication in output occurs since the <code>connect by works on root which is duplicated</code> as well.</p>

<pre><code>Oracle is not able to restrict the uniqueness since Oracle can't give preference to one of the other
</code></pre>

<p>Either make your data set unique or code them such that oracle can work on preference in hierarchy</p>
