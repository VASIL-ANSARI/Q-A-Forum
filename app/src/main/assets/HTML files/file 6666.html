<p>If you need an instance object instead of a pointer, try:</p>

<pre><code>trainer::trainer() : myPokemon(*this) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful if <code>Charizard</code> tries to call any methods on <code>tMyTrainer</code> in its constructor, because your new <code>trainer</code> object has not yet been fully constructed at that time.</p>
