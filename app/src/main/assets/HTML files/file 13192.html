<p>(Moved from comments, as I found more and more to say about it):</p>

<p>I haven't used ActiveAdmin, but... Any reason why an empty string wouldn't be stored as an empty string but a NULL?</p>

<p>I think the empty-string-to-Nil conversion should never be automatic, since it violates least surprise. I'd appreciate a doc reference stating the opposite if I'm wrong...</p>

<p>As for solving it, I'd guess this might do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>before_validation do
  self.mytextfield = nil if self.mytextfield &amp;&amp; self.mytextfield.empty?
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or, more systemic, <a href="https://github.com/rubiety/nilify_blanks" rel="nofollow">this gem</a>.</p>

<pre><code>class MyModel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  nilify_blanks :only =&gt; [:mytextfield]
end
</code></pre>
