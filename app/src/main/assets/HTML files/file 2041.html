<p>Microsoft TFS has a wonderful build solution built-in.  It's costly, but effective.  In addition, you cannot lose by looking at CruiseControl, which is free.  TeamCity from JetBrains is also a great option.  All of these Continuous Build and Integration solutions would provide a good starting point for your research.</p>
