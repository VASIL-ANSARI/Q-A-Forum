<p>You don't have any code that is setting the delegate for the UnderRightViewController. I don't know what object owns both of these controllers, but before either UnderRightViewController and FirstTopViewController are displayed it should run code something like this:</p>

<pre><code>FirstTopViewController *ftvc = //... where ever you get a reference to this from
UnderRightViewController *urvc = ...;
urvc.delegate = ftvc;
</code></pre>
