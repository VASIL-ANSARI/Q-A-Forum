<p><code>CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS</code> is the timeout for connection attempt.  Once the connection is established, it has no effect.  What you are interested in is <code>ReadTimeoutHandler</code>.</p>

<p>The default <code>SO_BACKLOG</code> is <code>NetUtils.SOMAXCONN</code>.  It does not limit the number of worker threads.
