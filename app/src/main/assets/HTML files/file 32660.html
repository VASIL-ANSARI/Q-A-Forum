<p>I just hit this exact same issue.</p>

<p>Setting the scrollview.delegate = nil before popping the view fixes the issue for me as well and honestly I don't think it will be a bad thing as it will likely aid garbage collection (I'm using Xamarin, so a slightly different garbage collector). The timing of the garbage collection is probably the root of the issue.</p>

<p>I don't think we're making a design error.</p>
