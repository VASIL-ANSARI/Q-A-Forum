<p>You have to  add Spring dependencies in your build path.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/eclipse/eclipse_java_build_path.htm" rel="nofollow">tutorial.</a></p>

<p>As per my experience with Spring, it depends upon multiple jars which is tedious to manage as described above. So, personally I use <a href="http://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">Maven</a> as build dependency management tool. You can find lots of <code>POM.xml</code> example in Web for Spring, however <a href="https://github.com/TheKojuEffect/OpERP/blob/master/OpERP/pom.xml" rel="nofollow">this pom.xml</a> is from one of my project in which I've used <code>Spring</code>.</p>

<p>Maven can be used for many aspects of build process as per your knowledge and if you're new to <code>Maven</code>, some basic guides and tutorials will do to use <code>Maven</code> as <a href="http://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">build-dependency-management</a> tool.</p>

<p>It would be better if you use <a href="http://spring.io/tools/eclipse" rel="nofollow">Spring-Tool-Suite with your eclipse</a> for productivity.</p>

<p>Spring's new site <a href="http://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">Spring.io</a> is very helpful resource to learn Spring.</p>

<p>And Maven Plugin for Eclipse: <a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/" rel="nofollow">m2eclipse</a></p>
