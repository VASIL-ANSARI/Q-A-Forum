<p>Got it!!..while testing in instruments, it showed this message while delving into the memory leaks</p>

<p><strong>[UIWebSelectionAssistant addNonEditableForceTextSelectionGestureRecognizersToView:]</strong></p>

<p>searching for this online brought me to <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/25526" rel="nofollow">https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/25526</a></p>

<p>Here is says that this is an UIWebView issue in iOS 9 and does not occur in iOS 8. On running my app in iOS 8 simulator I got no leaks. So I guess its an Apple issue after all. Hope they sort it out soon...</p>
