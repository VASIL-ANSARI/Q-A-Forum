<p>Try drawing it out... I don't know what your functions do exactly, so this makes some assumptions based on the names, but you can get the idea.</p>

<ol>
<li>you pass in <code>head</code> (red 'h')</li>
<li>you pass in <code>node</code> to delete (blue 'n')</li>
<li>you set local <code>nextNode</code> to the return of <code>nodeGetNext(node)</code> (I assume that's the node after the one to delete, the green 'nn')</li>
<li>you set <code>nodeToDelete</code> (purple ntd) to <code>node</code></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tWSD8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>So your code will point head at <code>nodeGetNext(nodeToDelete)</code>. This is actually your unused variable <code>nextNode</code>. Then you free <code>nodeToDelete</code>.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this is not what you wanted to do unless you know that the node to delete is right next to head. I think a more normal algorithm would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>from head search for node to delete</li>
<li>set "node to delete"-1 next to "node to delete"+1</li>
<li>delete "node to delete"</li>
</ol>

<p>With speical cases for the Head, or an empty list, etc.</p>
