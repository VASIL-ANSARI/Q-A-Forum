<p>I'm still not a 100% about the why, but I would suggest looking at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17923496/1698987">answer</a> for something similar.</p>

<p>I'm working with web services, and I can't remember needing to use base64 in a long time. Last time I did it was for a php one that talked to different applications ... You sure you need to do this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Example (using Andrej code). <strong>THIS CASE WORKS , BUT : Read the warning after the code for more</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>// Input
var my_string = "Hello world!";
// Get as binary
System.Text.ASCIIEncoding  encoding = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();
var input_as_binary = encoding.GetBytes(my_string);
    /*
        72 
        101 
        108 
        108 
        111 
        32 
        119 
        111 
        114 
        108 
        100 
        33 
    */
// If the following is not an exact divisor, It won't work.
int chunkSize = 6;
// Create a stream and reader
Stream stream = new MemoryStream(as_binary);
BinaryReader rdr = new BinaryReader(stream);
int streamLength = (int)rdr.BaseStream.Length;
// A stub to hold the bits of Base64. This will happen on your receiving end
var sb = new StringBuilder();

// from Andrej answer, I'm just using the "streamLength" Var he defined 
while (rdr.BaseStream.Position &lt; streamLength) 
{
    byte[] b = new byte[chunkSize];

    long remaining = streamLength - rdr.BaseStream.Position;
    if(remaining &gt;= chunkSize)
    {
        rdr.Read(b, 0, chunkSize);
    }
    else
    {
        rdr.Read(b, 0, (int)remaining);
    }
    string chunkString = Convert.ToBase64String(b).Dump("as base 64");

    // Lets assume we send it and it's received on the other side
    sb.Append(chunkString);
}

// This should happen on your receiving side as well
var other_side = sb.ToString(); // value =&gt; SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh
// Back into byte array
var byte_from_64 = Convert.FromBase64String(other_side);
// Back into string. Will hold "Hello World!"
var string_from_byte = encoding.GetString(byte_from_64);
</code></pre>

<p>The above works. But if you change the chunk size to something that doesn't give you precise Base64 bits (5 for example, instead of 6), you'll get a string like <code>SGVsbG8=IHdvcmw=ZCEAAAA=</code> and then an exception: </p>

<pre><code>FormatException

The input is not a valid Base-64 string as it contains a non-base 64 character 
, more than two padding characters, or an illegal character among the pa... 
</code></pre>

<p>Hence why I suggested playing around with your input :)</p>
