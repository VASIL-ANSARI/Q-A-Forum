<p>It depends on the concrete Implementation of the HttpHandler but in most cases it is possible. You have to add the MVC UrlRoutingModule and setup the MVC. I use MVC in a CMS environment with friendly url-s. The CMS is called EPiServer and from what you described it has pretty much the same functionality. I use ASP.NET MVC for the template pages. The path to the physical pages is actually handled by controllers' actions. It works fine and with some tweaking I can say that it is a lot better than WebFroms especially if you develop custom web applications.</p>
