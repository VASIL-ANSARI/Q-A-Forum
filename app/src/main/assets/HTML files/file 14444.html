<p>Using your current architecture, you need to use the MemoryStream that you just filled with data (not forgetting to reset its position to zero and to flush any pending writes)</p>

<pre><code>//I am currently stuck on this point.
swDecrypt.Flush();
ms.Position=0;
XmlTextReader lxmlReader = new XmlTextReader(ms);
</code></pre>

<p>however, my feeling is that you don't need a MemoryStream here. Instead, just supply the CryptoStream to the XmlTextReader:</p>

<pre><code>CryptoStream cryptostreamDecr = new CryptoStream(.....
XmlTextReader lxmlReader = new XmlTextReader(cryptostreamDecr);
</code></pre>
