<p>First try adding this to all your setters </p>

<pre><code>if (_domain == value) return;
</code></pre>

<p>So you don't call OnPropertyChanged if it does not change.<br>
This is a good practice in general.  </p>

<p>Second (only if the first does not work) put each button in a separate group so they don't call each other and handle setting others to false in your code behind.</p>
