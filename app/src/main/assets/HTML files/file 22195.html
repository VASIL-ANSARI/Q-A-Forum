<p>Following is what Java manual say for both connectTimeout and readTimeout:</p>

<p>connectTimeout</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used when
  opening a communications link to the resource referenced by this
  URLConnection. If the timeout expires before the connection can be
  established, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of
  zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>readTimeout</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in milliseconds. A
  non-zero value specifies the timeout when reading from Input stream
  when a connection is established to a resource. If the timeout expires
  before there is data available for read, a
  java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is
  interpreted as an infinite timeout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think in your case, you manage to establish communications link in less than 5 seconds, and you did not read any input stream. Hence the behavior is correct (wait until Apache times out)</p>
