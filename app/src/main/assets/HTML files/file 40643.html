<p>I quite did not understand your code but if you want to create N checkbuttons with labels in a list "ctrls" try this</p>

<pre><code># if ctrls is a list of all lables to your checkboxes
# i is the count and j is the text of label
for i,j in enumerate(ctrls): #what ever loop you want
    var = IntVar()
    c = Checkbutton(self.master,text=j,variable=var)
    boxes.append([j.strip(),var,c])
</code></pre>

<p>later if you want to check which buttons are checked</p>

<pre><code>for i in boxes:
    if i[1].get()==0:
        #do what ever you want 
        i[2].destroy()
</code></pre>
