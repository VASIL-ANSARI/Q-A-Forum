<p>What will the <code>SELECTs</code> look like?  If you always want all the data for a given device&amp;time, then pack them into a single column.  I suggest <code>JSON</code>-encoding.  Otherwise, you are asking for <code>INSERTing</code> 10,000 rows per second?</p>

<p>If you do need to keep the data items in separate rows, the be sure to use some form of batching -- multi-row <code>INSERT</code> (100 rows at a time), or LOAD DATA from a file.</p>

<p>When the table gets to be huge, there are many possible problems.  (Again, I need to see the <code>SELECTs</code> to go into more detail.)</p>

<p><code>PARTITIONIng</code>?  Not likely to help.  Especially not <code>BY HASH</code>.  Multiple tables are not likely to help.  (Again, I need to see the <code>SELECTs</code> to go into more detail.)</p>

<p>"I'm indexing Timestamp, TagID, DeviceID, Decimal Value" -- Do you mean one-column indexes?  Likely to be very much a waste.  (Again, I need to see the <code>SELECTs</code> to go into more detail.)</p>

<p>If you need to do large <code>SELECTs</code> to summarize the data; then let's talk about Summary tables.</p>

<p>Please provide <code>SHOW CREATE TABLE</code>.  You need to shrink the datatypes to save space.</p>
