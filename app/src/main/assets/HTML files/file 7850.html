<p>I was looking for a solution to this, when I stumbled upon this link: <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Demo-of-ADONET-POCO-with-140ad3ad">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Demo-of-ADONET-POCO-with-140ad3ad</a></p>

<p>Place the SSDLToSQLite3.tt file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Entity Framework Tools\DBGen and you should be able to choose this as the DDL Generation Template in the Entity Designer.</p>

<p>Once you do that, the model will create SQL suited for SQLite.</p>
