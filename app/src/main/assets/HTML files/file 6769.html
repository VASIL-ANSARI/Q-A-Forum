<p>I'm no expert, but it seems to me that if the fields are terminated by an empty string, then they have to be fixed size instead; there has to be some way to determine the boundaries between fields, and if there is no terminator, then they pretty much have to be fixed size.</p>

<p>I observe that the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL 5.5</a> manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>User variables cannot be used when loading data with fixed-row format because user variables do not have a display width.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It also (rather earlier on the page) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>If the FIELDS TERMINATED BY and FIELDS ENCLOSED BY values are both empty (''), a fixed-row (nondelimited) format is used. With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields (but you can still have a line terminator). Instead, column values are read and written using a field width wide enough to hold all values in the field. For TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, and BIGINT, the field widths are 4, 6, 8, 11, and 20, respectively, no matter what the declared display width is.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since your statement has no 'FIELDS ENCLOSED BY' and empty 'FIELDS ENCLOSED BY', that is why you have a fixed format.  And hence you cannot do as you want.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is easier to massage the data outside the DBMS - fixing the data representation might be one such operation.  I do have program that I call DBLDFMT that I've not used for a few years now, but it can do a variety of operations, such as convert decimal numbers with implicit decimal points (a mainframe trick; the price field might be 0023199, representing the value Â£231.99).  It can deal with date manipulations too (not necessarily using a particularly user-friendly notation, but it is able to deal with the problems I faced getting data from mainframes into a Unix DBMS - not MySQL; it didn't exist when I wrote this code.  Contact me if that might be of any interest - see my profile.</p>
