<p>Based on the very general details you have given there is no 'easier method' you are missing. We can't help you form the requirements of your application, but we can help with code if you paste examples of the code you are using, what you are trying to achieve, and what is going wrong with it. Pick one thing, try it out, and if it doesn't work and you get stuck then post it here. </p>
