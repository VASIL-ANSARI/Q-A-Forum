<hr>

<p>You see, if you're doing mathematics on paper then you might say that 20/100 is 0.2 not zero, right ?</p>

<p>But with computers, all of that computation will turn out to be zero. And because your tax variable is float it'll say 0.0 or whatever.
Because integer variable discard everything that comes after decimal.</p>

<p><em>For Example:</em> Suppose x is an integer type variable, then</p>

<pre><code>int x=7.5;
printf("The value of x is %d",x);
</code></pre>

<p>These statements will print 7 not 7.5, because x is integer type variable and everything after the decimal will be discarded.</p>
