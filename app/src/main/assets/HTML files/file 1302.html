<p>Subqueries inherit columns from outer queries.</p>

<p>I guess your SomeOtherDb.dbo.Customer does have a CustomerId column (which also seems likely from the names).</p>

<p>Which then also probably means that you are not doing with the subquery what you want to do with it - if the table in the subquery does not have a CustomerId column (and it seems so, otherwise there would be no error when running the subquery in itself), then the subquery selects and returns the outside CustomerId, and since that is the only column in the subquery, the subquery is useless.</p>
