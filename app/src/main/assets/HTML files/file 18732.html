<p>I imagine you've selected the whole of an element, such as one of the links. The crucial fact is that the <code>startContainer</code> of a range obtained from the selection is not guaranteed to be a text node.</p>

<p>If a whole element is selected, some browsers will report the selection as spanning the children of the element's parent node. For a selection spanning one of a number of consecutive images, for example, it's essential. Imagine the selection encompasses just the second image in the HTML below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the selected range will have <code>startContainer</code> and <code>endContainer</code> properties that refer to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element and <code>startOffset</code> 1 and <code>endOffset</code> 2, representing the range stretching between the children at indexes 1 and 2 in the container's <code>childNodes</code> property.</p>
