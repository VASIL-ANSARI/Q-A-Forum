<p>According to this, since you have declared a move constructor <em>and</em> a move assignment operator, but no copy assignment operator, copy constructor or destructor, you do <strong>not</strong> get the implicitly generated copy constructor or assignment operator. The compiler gives you their <em>declarations</em>, but they are declared as <code>deleted</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified version of your example:</p>

<pre><code>struct Test
{
public:
    Test(){}
    Test(Test&amp;&amp; other){}
    Test&amp; operator=(Test&amp;&amp; other) { return *this;}
};

int main()
{
  Test t1;
  Test t2(t1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the error produced by g++ 4.8.1</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ctors.cpp:13:13: error: use of deleted function 'constexpr Test::Test(const Test&amp;)'</p>
  
  <p>Test t2(t1);</p>
  
  <p>ctors.cpp:1:8: note: 'constexpr Test::Test(const Test&amp;)' is implicitly declared as deleted <em>because 'Test' declares a move constructor or move assignment operator</em></p>
  
  <p>struct Test</p>
