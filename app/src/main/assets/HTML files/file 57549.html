  <p>How can i store the array for the product into the same row.</p>

<p>IMO what you want to achieve is not a good idea. But if you insist that you <em>still</em> want to continue with that design, I suggest you use a dictionary with the item id as the key and the array as the value*. Then serialize the said dictionary before saving into the said <code>DataTable</code>.</p>

<p>*something like this perhaps?</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;int, double[]&gt; priceHistory = new Dictionary&lt;int, double[]&gt;();
priceHistory.Add(id, price);
</code></pre>

<p>for the serialization/deserialization, kindly refer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4733200/how-to-serialize-class-to-database-instead-of-file-system-c-sharp">here</a></p>
