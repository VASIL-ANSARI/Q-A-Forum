<p>Ids are singular, you can only have one element on the page with that id. Use a class name or the element type.</p>

<pre><code>$("table").on("click", '[type="submit"]', function() {
    var activeClass = this.value==="red" ? "ButtonClicked1" : "ButtonClicked";
    $(this).toggleClass(activeClass);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The weird thing is you are using a submit button so the form is going to submit, changing the color is not going to stick since the page is refreshing.</p>
