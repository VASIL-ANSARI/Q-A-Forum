<p>There's currently no way of doing this with CakePHP. However, you can get around it by piping a series of answers into the script.  I found the answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/399734/input-from-within-shell-script">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to answer <code>'y'</code> to every prompt, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'y' | cake schema create
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want to use defaults, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>printf "\n\n" | cake schema create
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use specific responses, you can list them, separated by newline characters. This will send <code>'y'</code> and then <code>'n'</code>, dropping the tables, and not recreating them:</p>

<pre><code>printf "y\nn\n" | cake schema create
</code></pre>
