<p>I would try to create a MySpinnerAdapter class, that implements SpinnerAdapter. In your MySpinnerAdapter, take a look at the getDropDownView method. I believe that's where the pop-up view is created. You could check your error state, and decide to return a different view there (allthough it might be in another function -> check the documentation)...</p>

<p><strong>Anyway, this answer is not a copy-paste one. Just trying to spit some new ideas</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class yourActivity extends Activity
{

    private class MySpinnerAdapter implements SpinnerAdapter
    {
        // There are quite a lot of methods you need to implement...

        @Override
        public View getDropDownView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) 
        {
                // Check your error states here
                if(&lt;we have some kind of error&gt;)
                    return specialErrorView // you get the idea

                // return the default view with options
                return normalView;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
