<p>This is a <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-handling.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL peculiarity</a>. If you were using any other DBMS you'd be getting a 'missing GROUP BY expression' syntax error.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-functions.html#function_count" rel="nofollow">COUNT()</a> is an aggregate function, what means that it combines several rows into one. If you don't have a <code>GROUP BY</code> clause that means you want to combine all matching rows into one, thus it doesn't make any sense to show values from an individual row. As I said, other database engines would just warn you about the error; MySQL, instead, simply picks data from an <strong>arbitrary row</strong> (not even a random row).</p>

<p>I know nothing about your data or business logic but...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MAX(video_seek) AS max_video_seek, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM videos
WHERE video_id = 1
AND video_seek &gt; 0
AND video_seek_end &gt; 0
</code></pre>
