<p>I don't know why there is a extra div, but you could write </p>

<pre><code>test-label:parent {
 ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>in your css file so the outer div behaves the way your span<br>
should do now and just ignore span.</p>

<p>If this don't help, I'll check this later, I don't have the time right now.</p>
