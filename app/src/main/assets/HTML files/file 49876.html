<p>If you are running the app in IIS and your connection string uses integrated security, the user it is going to use is whatever the app pool is running as. You can either change the user the app pool is running as, or provide the username and password for the windows authentication user you want to use in your connection string (something like <code>Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=SampleHR;Integrated Security=True;User ID=username;Password=password</code></p>
