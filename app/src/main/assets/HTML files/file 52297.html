<p>I'm no expert on matplotlib at all, but in the <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">Double Pendulum animation</a> they display texts which changes, and this leads to some variations which can help you.</p>

<p>To get legends with the actual color of the lines, you can either change the initial setting <code>lines</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>lines = [plt.plot([], [], label = 'line {}'.format(i))[0] for i in range(N)]
</code></pre>

<p>or add a <code>line.set_label()</code> to the <code>for</code> loop in the <code>init()</code> function. Both these seem to work as expected. At least if you add <code>plt.legend(loc="upper left")</code> right before <code>plt.show()</code>. </p>

<p>However the <code>set_label</code> doesn't work within the <code>animate()</code> function, but according to the linked animation you can use specific text fields added to the animation, and that seems to work nicely. Add the following code after initialisation of <code>lines</code>:</p>

<pre><code>texts = [ax.text(0.80, 0.95-i*0.05,  '', transform=ax.transAxes) for i in range(N)]
</code></pre>

<p>And change <code>animate()</code> to be:</p>

<pre><code>def animate(i):
    for j in range(N):
        lines[j].set_data([0, 2], [10*j,i]) #, label="hei {}".format(i))
        texts[j].set_text('line %d, stage %d'%(j,i))
    return lines
</code></pre>

<p>This places the text close to the upper right corner, and is updated for each animation step. Since the lines still have their legend displayed, you possibly simplify into one text only displaying the stage. But I leave the fine tuning of messages to your discretion.</p>

<h2>Addendum: Extend Line2D</h2>

<p>Another alternative could <em>possibly</em> be to extend <code>lines.Line2D</code> and use these lines in your animation, something similar to <a href="http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/line_with_text.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. Not sure if this would work with animation, but if you can't get the above to work, this might be worth a try.</p>
