<p>From the <code>signal(7)</code> man page:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Signal Mask and Pending Signals
    A  signal  may  be  blocked,  which means that it will not be delivered
    until it is later unblocked.  Between the time when it is generated and
    when it is delivered a signal is said to be pending.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>"Pending" and "blocked" are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Also from the <code>signal(7)</code> man page:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Synchronously Accepting a Signal
    Rather than asynchronously catching a signal via a signal  handler,  it
    is  possible to synchronously accept the signal, that is, to block exe-
    cution until the signal is delivered, at which point the kernel returns
    information about the signal to the caller.  There are two general ways
    to do this:

    * sigwaitinfo(2), sigtimedwait(2),  and  sigwait(3)  suspend  execution
      until  one  of  the signals in a specified set is delivered.  Each of
      these calls returns information about the delivered signal.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So <code>sigaction()</code> is used to allow other code to run until a signal is pending, whereas <code>sigwait()</code> suspends execution of the thread until a signal is pending but blocked.</p>
