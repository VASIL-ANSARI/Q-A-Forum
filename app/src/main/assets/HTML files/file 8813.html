<p>When you do <code>echo $array;</code>, PHP will simply echo 'Array' since it can't convert an array to a string. So The 'A' that you are actually getting is the first letter of Array, which is correct. </p>

<p>You might actually need </p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode($array);
</code></pre>

<p>This should get you what you want. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : And obviously, you'd need to change your JS to work with JSON instead of just text (as pointed out by @genesis) </p>
