<pre><code>function rall(r, s) {
 var a=[],t,g=r.global;
 do {t=r.exec(s);if (!t) break;
     a.push(t);} while (g);
 return a;
}

var r=/.*?(.)(?=(.*?\1.*))/g;
var res=rall(r,password);
</code></pre>

<p><code>res</code> will be an array of arrays containing all matches of repeating characters. </p>

<p>The RegExp uses a look ahead to find out whether a found character (captured in the first group) will re-appear later in the string. </p>

<p>A password like <code>secret elements</code> would come up as:</p>

<pre><code>"[["s","s","ecret elements"],
 ["e","e","cret elements"],
 ["cre","e","t elements"],
 ["t","t"," elements"],
 [" e","e","lements"],
 ["le","e","ments"]]"
</code></pre>

<p>The second element in each sub-array is the multiply matched character. </p>

<p>If there are no repetitions the array will have length=0 which is easy to test like:</p>

<pre><code>if (rall(r,password).length==0)
  console.log('password is OK!');
</code></pre>
