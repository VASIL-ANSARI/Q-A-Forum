<p>It looks fine to me, but I've been awake for 40 hours straight... so thats not really much to go on.  the only thing I can suggest is trying to combine the two if statements (you only need to know one is not null and that the two are equal to get a valid password).  the other thing to try would be to maybe check the length > 0 rather than check null?  I can't recall if an empty EditText returns null or empty string when you do a <code>getText().toString()</code> on it...</p>

<pre><code>if ((confirmpassword != null) &amp;&amp; password.equals(confirmpassword)) {
      request.addProperty("password", password);
}
</code></pre>
