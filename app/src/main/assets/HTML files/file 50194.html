<p>None of the operations you've described even touch the outer dict. They're completely fine to do.</p>

<p>If you did something like</p>

<pre><code>for key in outer_dict:
    outer_dict[key] = something_different
</code></pre>

<p>that <em>would</em> touch the outer dict, but it would still be fine. As long as you're not inserting or removing keys in the dict you're iterating over, you won't trigger a rehashing.</p>
