<p>I don't know why <code>@include</code> is not working since it seems that some of them must match facebook login page, anyway you can try to use <code>@match</code> instead to keep the things clear since some of your <code>@includes</code> are doing the same, for example your are adding:</p>

<pre><code>// @include     https://facebook.com/*
// @include     https://facebook.com/*/*
// @include     https://facebook.com/*/*/*
</code></pre>

<p>But with the first one is enough <code>// @include     https://facebook.com/*</code> since it already matches for example <code>https://facebook.com/example/path/other</code>.</p>

<p>So as I said to keep things clear you can try with <code>@match</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @name Open Test
// @version 1.0
// @description Test
// @match *://www.facebook.com/*
// @require http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
// ==/UserScript==

alert('Hello world!');
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this case <code>@match *://www.facebook.com/*</code>: 
  Match any URL with both schemes (http and https) in www.facebook.com.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically the difference between <code>@includes</code> and <code>@match</code> is that <code>@includes</code> allows regex, but in your case seems that this is not needed. </p>
