<p>You should <strong><em>really</em></strong> consider disabling the depth test when you "switch" from 3D to 2D if you are going to draw at <strong>Z=0</strong> (middle of your depth range). Half of the visible space in your 3D scene will potentially obstruct your 2D drawing if you do not do this. Alternatively, you could replace your <code>glVertex2f (...)</code> calls with <code>glVertex3f (x,y, -1.0)</code> to bring everything in 2D to the very front of the depth range.</p>

<p>But the really weird thing about all of this is the end of your <code>render2D (...)</code> function: You never call <code>glEnd (...)</code> and you pop a matrix that you appear never to have pushed.  That is two sources of mismatched weirdness, either one of them could be causing your problem.</p>
