<p>What you need to do is convert both dates to timestamp first and substract your original post date from current date and reconvert it back to your desired format. As an example see below.</p>

<pre><code>$now = time();
$datePosted = strtotime($item['date']);

$timePassed = $now - $datePosted;

$agoMinutes = $timePassed/60; //this will give you how many minutes passed
$agoHours = $agoMinutes/60; //this will give you how many hours passed
$agoDays = $agoHours/24; // this will give you how many days passed
</code></pre>

<p>And so on ... </p>

<p>Php's timestamp gives date in seconds so it is easier to calculate and work on it if you need mathematical operations. </p>
