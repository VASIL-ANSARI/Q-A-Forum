<p>Sorry, I believe it would be more work to get C++ on U-Boot than it would be for you to e.g. go with OS. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://u-boot.10912.n7.nabble.com/U-Boot-Building-C-Examples-td71586.html" rel="nofollow">short answer</a>, from U-Boot tech lead: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; Does u-boot support C++ example programs and if so, how can I build one? 
U-Boot does not support C++.
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the technical background for this: U-Boot runs on bare metal. A U-Boot standalone application would link to U-Boot's exported functions which the application needs. For example, your C++ application would use 'new', your C++ library needs to perform calls to malloc, which in this case would mean going to the u-boot exported function interface (refer to doc/README.standalone). </p>

<p>For the general topic of C++ on bare metal, I have not done that, but found <a href="http://www.embedded.com/design/mcus-processors-and-socs/4007119/Building-Bare-Metal-ARM-Systems-with-GNU-Part-1--Getting-Started" rel="nofollow">Miro Samek</a> tutorial that may shed light. I think it would be difficult. Porting linux starts to look good in comparison.</p>
