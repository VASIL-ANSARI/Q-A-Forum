<p>As the method name suggests, <code>setSoftScanTrigger</code> triggers the "soft scanner" which is ZXing on Android.</p>

<p>That method just calls a method on ScanApiHelper, passing in the soft scanner as the device to be triggered.</p>

<pre><code>public void setSoftScanTrigger(char action) {
    _scanApiHelper.postSetTriggerDevice(_softScanDevice, action, _onSetTrigger);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a reference to the physical device you'd like to trigger, you could trigger it in the same way.</p>

<p>You would need to modify your <code>SingleEntryApplication</code>, because it doesn't keep any references to physical scanners, by default. However, you can set and unset your physical device reference in the same place as it sets and unsets the reference to the soft scanner - the <code>onDeviceArrival</code> and <code>onDeviceRemoval</code> methods.</p>
