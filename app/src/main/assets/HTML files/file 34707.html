<pre><code>var candraw=false;

function candraw(e){
    candraw=true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So... what is <code>candraw</code>? Is it a Function or a Boolean? Once you overwrote <code>candraw</code> with <code>false</code> in <code>cannotdraw</code>, <code>candraw</code> is no longer a function.</p>

<p>Any way, this two functions are quite useless and should not even exist in the first place as two separate functions. You might want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function setDrawable(bool){
    candraw = bool;
}
</code></pre>
