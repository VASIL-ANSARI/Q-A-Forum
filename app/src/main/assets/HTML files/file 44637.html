<p>Okay the problem is what you are having is a jquery less event handler not triggering the jquery event stream.</p>

<p>This probaly ahs to do with the order of binding events. If the "vanilla" event handler is bound before jQuery it will get fired first. And if it has a redirect as you implied the browser will promptly call onunload and execute cleanup never executing your script.</p>

<p>It would help if I knew what you would want to be the result of catching this event.</p>

<p>if you want to stop the unload you can simply unbind the the event listener that redirects your page</p>

<p>document.getElementById('test').removeEventListener('change');</p>

<p>If you want jQuery bound before the script the third party has got its hooks in you need to unbind the event, add the jquery event listener then reattach the 3rd party event.</p>

<p>There is no other way to intercept it in time before unload because the script will always beat jQuery to the punch in adding the event handler unless you can manipulate the script loading order in such a way your event handler will get bound first before the event handler of the 3rd party script.</p>

<p>It would help to see the full example with 3rd party script.</p>
