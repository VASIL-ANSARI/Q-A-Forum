<p>Why don't you just count the number of DIVs you have?   </p>

<pre><code>$(".add-question-new").length
</code></pre>

<p>will get you a count of elements with that class.</p>

<pre><code>$("DIV.add-question-new").length 
</code></pre>

<p>will get you a count of only divs with that class.</p>

<pre><code>$("DIV.add-question-new.deleted").length
</code></pre>

<p>will get you a count of DIVS with the class of <code>.add-question-new</code> and <code>.deleted</code>.  So, if they tag it as deleted, you just apply a deleted class to it.  It'd look like </p>

<pre><code>&lt;DIV class="add-question-new deleted"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then with CSS you can either keep it around or remove it   <code>{DIV.add-question-new.deleted:  display:none;}</code>     (or do nothing).</p>

<p>That way you're depending on actual numbers of elements on the page --  instead of tracking a sort-of-maybe-right-maybe-not counter that's supposed to be a representation of what you can determine by just studying the DOM.</p>
