<p>I don't think it's available with current WMA specification.
if you want to create such a service I suggest you to create an SMS gateway that received the SMS, combined with J2SE/J2EE application that connect to internet.
The SMS gateway parse the sms content for email address, send to the J2SE/J2EE application and this application create email based on the parameter which email address and the rest of the sms content.</p>
