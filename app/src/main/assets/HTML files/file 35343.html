<p><code>break</code> will exit the loop completely, <code>continue</code> will just skip the current iteration and will carry on the next one.</p>

<p>For example in your loop in let's say <code>i</code> is equal to 50 and you put <code>break</code> the loop will exit the loop but if you use <code>continue</code> it will skip this iteration and it will start the next one - <code>i</code> will be equal 51.</p>
