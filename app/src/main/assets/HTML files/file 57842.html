<p>When returning files you shouldn't call the end method, here:</p>

<pre><code>router.route(HttpMethod.GET, "/*").handler(StaticHandler.create()).failureHandler(event -&gt; { // This serves up the React app
  event.response().sendFile("webroot/index.html").end();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that sending the file is an asynchronous call which will pump the file to the response in an optimized way and when you call end you're saying close the response <strong>NOW</strong>!</p>

<p>What it seems to be happening is that your file is quite small so the OS can pump it right away in one go (so your browser still receives it correctly) but you try to close the connection when the OS has already done it for you.</p>

<p>What you should have is:</p>

<pre><code>router.route(HttpMethod.GET, "/*").handler(StaticHandler.create()).failureHandler(event -&gt; { // This serves up the React app
  event.response().sendFile("webroot/index.html");
});
</code></pre>
