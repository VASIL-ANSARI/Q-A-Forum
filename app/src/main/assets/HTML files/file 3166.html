<p>You shouldn't give the extends keyword in the actual instantiation of a generic class because it needs to know what type it actually is. You will have to use that type or a wildcard, meaning either </p>

<pre><code>Entity1Dao&lt;Entity1&gt;
// or
Entity1Dao&lt;?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Hibernate and want to implement a generic DAO you probably won't need the Entity superclass at all, because the Hibernate Template can work with any class that is a registered entity. I tried the Entity Superclass approach once, too but it just became a huge generic hassle without much benefit (especially when using Hibernate annotations, which don't play very well with inheritance).</p>
