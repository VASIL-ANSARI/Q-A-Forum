<p>I hope you realise that at some point your table will have irrational number of columns and will be highly inefficent. I strongly advise you to use other solution, for example another table that holds data for each row for each day. </p>

<p>Let's say you have a table with 2000 rows and two columns: ID and URL. Now you want to know the count of hits for each URL so you add column HITS. But then you realise you will need to know the count of hits for each URL for every date, so your best bet is to split the tables. At this moment you have one table:</p>

<pre><code>Table A (A_ID, URL, HITS)
</code></pre>

<p>Now remove HITS from Table A and create Table B with ID and HITS attributes). Now you have:</p>

<pre><code>Table A (A_ID, URL)
Table B (B_ID, HITS)
</code></pre>

<p>Next move is to connect those two tables:</p>

<pre><code>Table A (A_ID, URL)
Table B (B_ID, A_ID, HITS)
</code></pre>

<p>Where A_ID is foreign key to attribute "A_ID" of Table A. In the end it's the same as first step. But now it's easy to add date attribute to Table B:</p>

<pre><code>Table A (A_ID, URL)
Table B (B_ID, A_ID, HITS, DATE)
</code></pre>

<p>And you have your solution for database structure. You will have a lot of entries in table B, but it's still better than a lot of columns. Example of how it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>Table A | A_ID |    URL
           0      index
           1      contact

Table B | B_ID | A_ID | HITS | DATE
           0      0      23    12.04.2013
           1      1      12    12.04.2013
           2      0      219   13.04.2013
           3      1      99    13.04.2013
</code></pre>

<p>You can also make unique index of A_ID and DATE in Table B, but I prefer to work on IDs even on linking tables.</p>
