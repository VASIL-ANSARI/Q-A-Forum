<p>You may give a try to <code>application uploader</code>. Yesterday me too faced this problem and even application upload didn't work for me then I tried this:</p>

<p>For uploading it via XCode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Step1: Firstly Validate your archive file by clicking on validation
  button of Organiser.</p>
  
  <p>Step2: Then Upload it to App Store via Oraganiser. By clicking on
  distribute and then first option and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it really worked for me</p>
