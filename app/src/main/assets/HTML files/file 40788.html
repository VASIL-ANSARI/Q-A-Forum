<p>Funny how I spend hours looking for the solution and as soon as I resort to asking for help, I find the answer...</p>

<p>It turns out that my rowKeys were identical, and rowKeys must be unique for any given partition:</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179338.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179338.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The row key is a unique identifier for an entity within a given
  partition</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone else one day.</p>
