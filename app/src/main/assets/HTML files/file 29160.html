<p>You should not have any problem using <code>session_start()</code> in the landing page . You would just need to make sure your header script is included at the top of the page so that nothing else is sent to be browser before the call to <code>session_start()</code> . It is because :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong> : To use cookie-based sessions, session_start() must be called before outputing anything to the browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Above note is copied from : <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php</a></p>

<p>May be you can do this : Check if header are already sent . If headers are already sent avoid calling <code>session_start()</code> .</p>

<p>This page might help you in that direction : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2820639/how-to-check-if-headers-already-been-sent-in-php">How to check if Headers already been sent in PHP</a></p>

<p>You would still need to find the reason for the issue and would need to fix it but for time being code along this lines should help :</p>

<pre><code>if( ! headers_sent() )
{
    session_start();
    $lifetime=5000000;
    session_set_cookie_params($lifetime);
}
</code></pre>
