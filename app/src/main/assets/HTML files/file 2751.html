<p>Regarding the GUI elements in your second point, any or all of the Qt examples shown can have how they are drawn change through the use of <code>QStyle</code> subclasses.  In addition to that, you can easily make a full-screen window, where no borders or window frames are shown.  If you combine those two options (a full-screen window as background, with styled widgets on it), you can make a GUI that can appear just as nice as the iPhone GUI.  The actual behavior in some widgets may be slightly different, but I'm assuming you know the basics of changing behavior via settings and subclassing.</p>
