<p>Go to <code>settings&gt; applications&gt; manage applications&gt; all apps&gt; scroll down list to&gt;my uploads (if you can't find&gt; com.google.Android.apps.uploader) clear data</code> </p>

<p>That's all you have to do for any uploads that get stuck on sending but don't finish sending msgs.I founds this answer on Android Forum.  The app is called: "my uploads" in my Droid phone settings. </p>
