<p>The <code>nextproject</code> cursor has no relationship defined between TASK and either of the other tables used in the cursor, so every row in TASK is being joined to all the valid combinations of PROJECT and CUSTOMER. This is known as a "Cartesian join" and is probably not what you had in mind. To correct this you need modify the cursor slightly:</p>

<pre><code>cursor nextproject is
  select p.pjno, c.custname, t.taskno, t.descrip, t.hrs, t.start_date
    from task T, project P, customer C
    where C.custno = P.custno and
          p.custno = custnum
      AND t.pjno = p.pjno;  -- ADDED
</code></pre>

<p>This may or may not fix all your problems, but it should move you along with this assignment.</p>
