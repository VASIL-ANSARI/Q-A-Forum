<p>Do you control the source DLL?  If not then no, the DLL relies on the C++ 2008 Runtime and it must be installed for the DLL to run and you need to add that as part of your install.</p>

<p>If you you do control the source for the DLL then statically link it to the C++ runtime, which will build the runtime into the DLL.</p>

<p>This issue has nothing to do with Windows XP.  The DLL requires the C++ 2008 runtime on Vista and 7 as well, it just so happens that the machines you tested with already had it installed.  The C++ runtime is not guaranteed to be installed on an any version of Windows.</p>
