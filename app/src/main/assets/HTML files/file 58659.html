<p>You would need to replace a single <code>BIPUSH 10</code> (<code>IntInsnNode</code>) instruction with a chain of</p>

<pre><code>ICONST_2 // InsnNode
BIPUSH 8 // IntInsnNode
IADD     // InsnNode
INEG     // InsnNode
INEG     // InsnNode
</code></pre>

<p>If your goal is that the <code>BIPUSH 10</code> should not be discoverable when opening a class in a hex editor, this might do the trick but I would hardly call this obfuscation. It is easy enough to reduce this chain of bytecodes to the original value.</p>

<p>Finally, note that this replacement changes the stack size requirement such that you probably need to adjust the <code>maxStack</code> variable.</p>
