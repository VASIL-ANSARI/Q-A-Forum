<p>I would imagine it has to do with the fact that your Javascript has the city hard coded in it. I presume (without seeing the PHP) that you are echoing "London" here:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $city;?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So anytime showHideDiv() is called, it only gets called on London, and not Paris. You probably need to pass in the id as a parameter into the function.</p>

<p>You may consider looking at jQuery. It would make this easy.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Using your code, you'd pass in the parameter as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function showHideDiv(city_id) {
    var divstyle = new String();
    divstyle = document.getElementById(city_id).style.visibility;
    // . . . Rest of your code. Replace all instances of &lt;?php echo . . ?&gt; with 
    // city_id.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'd have to specify the city in your onclick for each city.</p>

<p>Using jQuery, you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(".city").click(function() {
        $(this).toggle();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And then your HTML would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="london" class="city"&gt;List of providers in London&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="paris" class="city"&gt;List of providers in Paris&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
