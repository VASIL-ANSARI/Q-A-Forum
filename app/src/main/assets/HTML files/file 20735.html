<p>It's exactly the same as with normal types. </p>

<pre><code>Class a; //stack. Usage: a.somethingInsideOfTheObject
Class *a = new Class(); //heap. Usage: a-&gt;somethingInsideOfTheObject
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if the class itself is allocating something on the heap, that part will always be on the heap, for example:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass()
    {
        a = new int();
    }
private:
    int * a;
};

void foo()
{
    MyClass bar;
}
</code></pre>

<p>in this case the <code>bar</code> variable will be allocated on the stack, but the <code>a</code> inside of it will be allocated on the heap.</p>
