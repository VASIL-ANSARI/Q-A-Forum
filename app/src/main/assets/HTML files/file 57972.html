<p><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/" rel="nofollow"><strong>FileWriter</strong></a> is a good place to start, if you only care about Chrome.</p>

<p>Otherwise, an interesting hack is using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" rel="nofollow"><strong>IndexedDB</strong></a> to store chunks as blobs, because they'll <em>technically</em> be stored to disk, then constructing a big blob out of these chunks, and providing a link to it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>URL.createObjectURL</code></strong></a>. It doesn't involve loading anything into memory, since blobs are just references to data, not the data itself, and in this case, all the data is stored off-memory, inside IndexedDB. The only problem here is the extra copy of all the data.</p>

<p>It's not as nice as FileWriter, but this hack is the only solution to work across many browsers (Safari being a notable exception, as always.)</p>
