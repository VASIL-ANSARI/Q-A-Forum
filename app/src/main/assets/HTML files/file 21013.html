<p>In the <code>Content-Type</code> meta tag, the valid way is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason Chrome displays properly is because it is more accepting of errors in this case whereas IE requires it to be written properly.</p>

<p>However it's different with MySQL. They decided to go with the short names. Here is a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-charsets.html" rel="nofollow">list of supported character sets</a>. This is something done server-side, so it won't matter what browser you are using.</p>

<p>You can also execute the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW CHARACTER SET LIKE 'utf%'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Make sure that you are using the same character set to <code>INSERT</code> into your database or this could cause undesired effects when you go to view it again.</p>
