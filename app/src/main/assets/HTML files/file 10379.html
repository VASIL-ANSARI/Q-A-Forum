<p>If you have to take the information as Hex then it may be worth building a small worker class to convert the data on the C# app side before passing it into SQL, this can be done by converting the hex two characters at a time into its ASCII equivalent with  Int32.Parse(string, NumberStyle.HexNumber)</p>

<p>Not sure if this applies to your requirement but its one option!</p>
