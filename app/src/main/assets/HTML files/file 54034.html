<p>Well , actually just a second after i posted the question i realized the shuffle option is enabled:</p>

<pre><code>        shuffle: true,
</code></pre>

<p>That needs to be turned to false.</p>

<p>P.S. i beleive when shuffle is turned on, <code>gotoSlide</code> should be turned off or should not work , or should just log a message in the console saying something like "when shuffle is turned on , <code>gotoSlide</code> s dysfunctional" , i've just spent 2 hours on this issue and i see no point of using <code>gotoslide</code> when shuffle is turned on !</p>
