<p>Rdio has an <a href="http://developer.rdio.com/" rel="nofollow">API</a>. Here's some info on how to get the currently playing track: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rdio-api/browse_thread/thread/23d52c77b4e56a55/3b8a897f0835fd90" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/rdio-api/browse_thread/thread/23d52c77b4e56a55/3b8a897f0835fd90</a></p>

<p>You can also get the url of the currently playing track via Applescript. This should serve as a sort of unique ID for the track:</p>

<pre><code>osascript -e 'tell app "Rdio" to get the rdio url of the current track'
</code></pre>
