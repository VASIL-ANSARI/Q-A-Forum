<p>I think what you're doing will work though you may not have to use the habtm. What if an item can have many locks and can only be deleted when it has no locks. That way you could add a date/reason/comment for each lock by user.</p>

<ul>
<li>user
<ul>
<li>has_many :locks</li>
<li>has_many :items</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lock
<ul>
<li>belongs_to :user</li>
<li>belongs_to :item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>item
<ul>
<li>belongs_to :user</li>
<li>has_many :locks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This will still allow you to do <code>user.locks</code> though <code>item.lock.users</code> won't work, but by looking at each lock you'll easily be able to get the users.</p>

<pre><code>item.locks.each do |lock|
    puts lock.user
end
</code></pre>
