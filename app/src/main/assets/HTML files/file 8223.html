<p>The difference between the two is that Marshal by value copies the entire object across application domain boundaries; with MarshalByRefObject, you are effectively sharing the object between the domains as a reference (see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.marshalbyrefobject.aspx" rel="nofollow">specifics on MSDN</a>).</p>

<p>Therefore, if objects are large, and performance is an issue, MarshalByRefObject will probably be the best way to go.</p>
