<p>You can check this (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2057014/customerrors-for-401-2-in-asp-net">customerrors for 401.2 in ASP.NET</a>)</p>

<p>As a workaround, you can handle it in Authenication_Request event in Global.asax and redirect the unauthorized users</p>

<p>However, my recommendation is to redirect unauthorized requests to log in page. as the requester may be authorized but just forgot to log in. So your approach will add extra step.</p>
