<p>You need to set <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/blob/master/docs/general/rendering.md#explicit-serializer" rel="nofollow">explicit serializer</a> like this:</p>

<pre><code>render json: {movie: movie, casts: casts , directors: directors}, serializer: MovieCastDirectorSerializer
</code></pre>

<p>Because AMS doesn't know which serializer needed for your plain ruby object that you construct here. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
But even if you do so, AMS still will be unable to serialize that as it will be not ActiveModel object. <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/active-model-serializers" rel="nofollow">There is an example</a> of how to deal with that. But for me personally, it seems too much like a hack. I think you should not abuse REST so early and should separate serializers by actual end-points and only nest resources if they are nested in the real structure. Because later as your code matures it'll be really difficult to tell where you getting that data you see on display after all.</p>
