<p><code>cc()</code> is the function cited in your linked question. It's the code block just above the generated URL you cited.</p>

<p>about <code>info.h</code>: It's a variable. You'd need to study where the variable is set in the given script. It's not a header file and has nothing to do with C++.</p>

<p>As an alternative, you can also download the youtube webpage and then search the video's config (written in json). There is an url encoded paramater with the name "url_encoded_fmt_stream_map". Just decode it and find the streams with "type=audio". Usually you get an mp4 and vorbis option. This might be easier than using a forign service.</p>
