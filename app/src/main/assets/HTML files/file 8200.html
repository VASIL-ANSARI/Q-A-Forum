<p>It looks like this is just an empty JPanel which additionally contains a reference to an object of the main class.</p>

<p>It could be that this could be simply replaced by a plain <code>JPanel</code> (ommiting the <code>demo</code> argument).</p>

<p>It could be that someone planned to used this class for some goal but forgot this later. Or someone misunderstood and thought that every GUI object one uses must have an own subclass. The comment <code>//Main panel in the GUI</code> looks like this.</p>

<p>If you have someone who wrote this code, ask him (or her) - otherwise I would just replace its use with a simple JPanel to cut down the number of classes. (You have a version control system, don't you?)</p>
