<p>According to the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/typesandpropertyclasses.html" rel="nofollow">Types and Property Classes doc</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Engine datastore supports a
  fixed set of value types for
  properties on data entities. Property
  classes can define new types that are
  converted to and from the underlying
  value types, and the value types can
  be used directly with Expando dynamic
  properties and <strong>ListProperty</strong> aggregate
  property models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reading of this suggests that you should be able to just specify the extended db.Property as the item_type of the for the ListProperty.  But there is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2439" rel="nofollow">logged issue</a> that suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>Assuming that doesn't work, I think the next best thing is probably to subclass ListProperty and manually extend it with getters, setters, and iterators, based on the "get_value_for_datastore" and "make_value_from_datastore" functions for lists with "FuzzyDateProperty" members.</p>
