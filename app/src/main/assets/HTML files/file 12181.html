<p>You're being confused by this line:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"x",h3Tag);
</code></pre>

<p>All this line does is log the string <code>x</code>. The second argument is completely unused. What you want is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"%@", h3Tag);
</code></pre>

<p>or perhaps a bit more descriptive:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"h3Tag: %@", h3Tag);
</code></pre>

<p>The token <code>%@</code> inside of the format string indicates that this is where the next argument will be printed.
