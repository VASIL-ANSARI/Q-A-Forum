<p>You should start by reading the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/file-folder.html#folder-api" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> first. See the <code>$create</code> variable and how it's set to false by default? That means that a folder is not "just" created when you fire up an instance of the Folder utility, unless you set the <code>$create</code> argument to true, like:</p>

<pre><code>$dir = new Folder(WWW_ROOT . 'imggg', true);
</code></pre>

<p>So, you need to explicity tell Cake you want it to create the folder if it doesn't exist yet.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can just create a fresh Folder instance and then call the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/file-folder.html#Cake%5CFilesystem%5CFolder::create" rel="nofollow">create</a> method on that:</p>

<pre><code>$dir = new Folder();
$dir-&gt;create(WWW_ROOT . 'imggg');
</code></pre>
