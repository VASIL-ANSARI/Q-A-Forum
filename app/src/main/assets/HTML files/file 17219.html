<p>This is based on the time zone information stored on the system itself, and is not part of the framework.  From the documentation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timezoneinfo.findsystemtimezonebyid.aspx" rel="nofollow">FindSystemTimeZoneById</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FindSystemTimeZoneById tries to match id to the subkey names of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones branch of the registry under Windows XP and Windows Vista. This branch does not necessarily contain a comprehensive list of time zone identifiers. </p>

<p>Basically, if you're using a time zone defined in Windows by default, it should be safe - but it is based on the system itself, not the framework.</p>
