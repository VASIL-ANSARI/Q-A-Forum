<p>Several options.</p>

<p>1) Use the category position stuff built into magento to order your categories through the admin into the order you desire. </p>

<p>2) Create a new UL element every 4 categories and use CSS styling to display each UL in a column type format. e.g. create a UL element. Count the categories outputted within the UL and every 4 categories you close the UL and then open a new one. You can use the count % 4 == 0 (mod) function to determine if you need to output a new UL.</p>

<p>3) Modify the SQL being generated in the block which gets the categories to have an order by clause (This is not simple with the order you want).</p>

<p>Personally I would try step 2 first and fail back to step 1 if need be. It's not as if your ordering by a column value so adding the sort by to the collection may be troublesome.</p>
