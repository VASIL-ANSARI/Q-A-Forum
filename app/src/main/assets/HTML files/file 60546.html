<p>To have your proxy retry your request on another node after a failure, mod jk would need to know that a request was idemopotent.</p>

<p>I do see that adding this knowledge of idemoptency was discussed a long time ago.  <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39692" rel="nofollow">https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39692</a></p>

<p>I doubt that they implemented this functionality.</p>

<p>I have seen other reverse proxy solutions implement an idempotency identifier.  I seem to remember Weblogic having this ability.  I have also seen it with certain hardware proxies.</p>
