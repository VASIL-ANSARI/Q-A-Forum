<p>Any given cell's position is determined by the collection view. You can adjust the cell's insets to increase spacing between cells and the scroll view's insets to position all of the cells in the scroll view, you can't directly manipulate a cell's position out of the box. When noting the position of your first cell you should also take into account whether your viewController has extend edges under top bars on and whether it has adjust scroll view insets on. </p>
