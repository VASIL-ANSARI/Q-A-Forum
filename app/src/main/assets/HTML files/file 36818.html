<p>I believe what you are looking for is</p>

<pre><code>insert into Table3
select t2.product,t2.letter1,t2.letter2,t2.letter3 
from Table 1 t1
inner join Table 2 t2 on t1.number = t2.number
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if you need a where clause since I can't really see what you would be filtering on unless it would be the letter in which case just add </p>

<pre><code>where t2.letter1 =x and t2.letter2 = y, and t2.letter3 = z
</code></pre>
