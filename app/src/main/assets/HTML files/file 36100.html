<p>I think your problem is in notifyDataSetChanged. because when you call notifyDataSetChanged you tell the viewPager hey viewPager i have removed or created some children for you, reload yourself. and when he reload himself he creates fragments without any changed you have already made. so I think you should change your logic.</p>

<p>look at these for solution:
