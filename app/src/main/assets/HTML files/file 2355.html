<p>I am not sure, what exactly your problem is. </p>

<p>Just add all the tests to a suite (or hirachy of suites). Then use the Categories Runner and Include/ExcludeCategory annotation, to specify the categories you want to run.</p>

<p>A good idea might be to have one suite containing all the tests, and a couple of seperate suites referring to the first one, specifying the different set of Categories you neeed.</p>
