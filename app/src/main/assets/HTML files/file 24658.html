<p>Your guess is essentially correct. Classes are reference types, so your line Block clonedBlock = blocks[0]; is setting the clonedBlock to the same address as blocks[0]. Any changes made to one will be reflected in the other. You're better off to create a new instance of Block and add it to the list, unless there's some reason you want to copy the other block and simply change it's position.</p>

<p>One way to hanlde this is to implement a deep copy (I think that's the term - been years since I did anything in C++). Create a new instance of Block, and then copy the values from the original to the new one.</p>

<p>You could look at implementing ICloneable, or simply writing your own copy method (in reality if you implement ICloneable, you're still writing your own copy method - the interface just ensures that classes using it implement a <code>Clone</code> method.  Deep or shallow is up to the implementer).</p>

<p>Also, take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.memberwiseclone.aspx" rel="nofollow">Object.MemberwiseClone</a> Method.  <code>Object.MemberwiseClone</code> does a shallow copy, but there is an example of doing both a shallow and deep copy in Examples section.</p>
