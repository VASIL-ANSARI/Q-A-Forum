<p>Use <code>%s</code> as your format specifier if you're trying to get a string. You might also want to limit its length to 5, since that's how much space you have for <code>last</code> and <code>first</code>. So that would be <code>%5s</code>. Also, 5 characters is pretty short for a name.</p>

<p>Another comment: arrays in C are zero-based, so <code>employee[1]</code> is the second <code>employeelist</code> in your array. If you want to do this in a loop with an incrementing index, start at 0.</p>
