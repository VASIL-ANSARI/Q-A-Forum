<p>Hm, it is several ways to achieve your goal, one of them is to include your module with methods direct in <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, 'ApplicationController' and <code>Rspec</code>.
Not sure about RSpec (I don't quite sign with it's class/module structure) but you can do something like this in some initializer file:</p>

<pre><code>class ActiveRecord::Base
 include MyModuleWithAwesomeMethods
end

class ApplicationController
 include MyModuleWithAwesomeMethods
end
</code></pre>

<p>etc. for other classes/modules<br />
Hope it will help you. </p>
