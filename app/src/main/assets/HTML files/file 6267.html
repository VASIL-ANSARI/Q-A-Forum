<p>You don't usually copy an entity.  (I'm not sure what happens if you call <code>copy</code> on an <code>NSManagedObject</code>... it's not explained in the documentation, as far as I know. Experts can correct me. )</p>

<p>Just create another entity, or write a method which does just that.</p>

<p>I think another way is to make many-to-many relationships between <code>Exam</code> and <code>Student</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>create relationships in <code>Exam</code> called <code>studentsToTakeThisExam</code> and <code>studentsWhoTookThisExam</code>.</li>
<li>create relationships in <code>Student</code> called <code>examsToTake</code> and <code>examsAlreadyTaken</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>and set up the inverse relationships accordingly.</p>
