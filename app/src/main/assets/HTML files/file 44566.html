<p>When you do <code>select ng-model="countSelector"</code>, you are binding your select to <code>$scope.countSelector</code></p>

<p>So, inside your controller, if you want to have an access to your selected value, you use the following :</p>

<pre><code>$scope.countSelector
</code></pre>

<p>edit :</p>

<p>according to your requirements, you might want to have directly the value inside $scope.countSelector. To do so, you can adapt your ng-options to the following :</p>

<pre><code>ng-options="opt.id as opt.label for opt in options"
</code></pre>
