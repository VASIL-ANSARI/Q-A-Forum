<p>I have been faced with a similar problem.
In the end I solved it by simply using Selection changed event of first combobox like this (GetSubItems is own implemented):</p>

<pre><code>   private void cbFirst_SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        //if (selIndex != null)
        {
            cbSecond.ItemsSource = null;
            IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; str = GetSubItems(cbFirst.SelectedIndex);
            cbSecond.ItemsSource = str;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
