<p>This script grammatically creates <code>&lt;script/&gt;</code> HTML tag with given <code>src</code> URL and appends it to the beginning of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in the page DOM:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/PostcodeAnywhere/Interactive/FindByPostcode/v1.00/json.ws?&amp;Key=...&amp;Postcode=...&amp;Postcode="&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;!-- the rest of the HEAD --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It also attaches event handler to both <code>onload</code> and <code>onreadystatechange</code>. This event is triggered when the script is loaded. Interestingly, it removes the event handler and the <code>&lt;script/&gt;</code> tag once it is loaded, cleaning up after itself.</p>

<p>Probably the script runs some code immediately after being downloaded for its side-effects. E.g. it creates a global object or modifies the DOM. Once the script is done, it is removed for some reason.</p>
