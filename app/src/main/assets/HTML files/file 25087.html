<p>It depends on which <code>Queue</code> implementation you use. Generally speaking it is not necessarily the case.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc for Queue</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also adds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you simply need to check the javadoc of the specific queue you are using and you should find your answer.</p>
