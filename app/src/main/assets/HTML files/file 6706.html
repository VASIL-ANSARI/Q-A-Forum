<p>I totally agree with you. This is not consistent behavior but it is how it has been implemented. There are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.binarywriter.aspx" rel="nofollow">comments</a> at the end of the documentation about this behavior which is not very intuitive. All stream writers just take ownership of the underlying stream and dispose it. Personally I always nest my <code>using</code> statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
using(var writer = BinaryWriter(ms))
{
    writer.Write(/*something*/);
}
</code></pre>

<p>so that a code like the one you put in the Assert shouldn't be written.</p>
