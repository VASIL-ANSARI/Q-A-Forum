<pre><code>JSON.parse(jsonString);
</code></pre>

<p>For older browsers that don't have native JSON support, you can simply include <a href="http://www.json.org/js.html" rel="nofollow">json2.js</a> and this will become a usable function.</p>

<hr>

<p>Or you can skip this step with some server side scripting.  You can simply write the JSON into a script tag.  It is parsed implicitly by the script tag instead, as raw javascript.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  var myObj = &lt;%= myJsonString %&gt;;
  console.log('we got this value: '+ myObj.myValue);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
