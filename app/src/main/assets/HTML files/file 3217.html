<p>Hudson doesn't have a built in copy to some random location task so you have the following options</p>

<ul>
<li>Add another nant/msbuild step that does the deploy</li>
<li>Install the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Post+build+task" rel="nofollow">Post Build Plugin</a> and call a .cmd file to do your deploy</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/CopyArchiver+Plugin" rel="nofollow">Copy Archiver Plugin</a> to do the copy  - more specific than the post build plugin. (Thanks @nos)</li>
</ul>

<p>The extra task in your nant file is probably the best option as nant can control IIS and do the right thing rather than just copying the files into a folder. </p>
