<p>If you want each client to be totally isolate then you need to put all of the HTML being used within the <code>template</code> of the <code>directive</code>. this is because the current html you have, and the model's your binding are controlled by the controller and not the directive</p>

<p>I.E... (haven't tested with your code, but its what you need to do) - it's likely you need to change the <code>ng-model</code> in your template to the model you will push into the directive though - <strong>this is just as an example</strong></p>

<pre><code>return{
    ....
    template: '&lt;legend&gt;Client 156510&lt;/legend&gt;'
            + '&lt;section&gt;'
            + '&lt;div class="horizontal-field"&gt;'
            ...........
            + '&lt;/section&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>then your html would simply be something like (again, psuedo-code):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset client="156510" ng-model="yourModel"&gt;&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>
