<p>Without knowing your schema and what you've done for indexes, one POSSIBLE way to make this faster is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT (select ifnull(count(*),0) from table1 where table1.member_id = m.id) as num1,
 (select ifnull(count(*),0) from table2 where table2.member_id = m.id) as num2,
 (select ifnull(count(*),0) from table3 where table3.member_id = m.id) as num3
from member m
WHERE m.member_id = 27
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is a slightly risky recommendation, simply because I don't know anything about your DB or what else is running, or where the bottlenecks are.  </p>

<p>In general, it would be a good idea to post an explain plan with your query to get a better answer.</p>
