<p>I'm not aware of any Java libraries that can add Power Query queries to an Excel file. The structure inside of the Excel file is documented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt577248(v=office.12).aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so you could implement yourself, or request a library developer to implement it.</p>
