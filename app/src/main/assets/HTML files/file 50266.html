<p>Yes.  If you have a project set up in Eclipse, Netbeans, or another IDE, you can attempt to add a class to a project without adding a package.  It'll usually say something like "Adding classes to the default package is not recommended," but allow you to add that class to the default package anyway.  Alternatively, you could attempt to run <code>javac</code> on a <code>.java</code> without a package, which would work assuming that all imports, syntax, etc. are correct.</p>
