<p>You need to put curly braces around the content of your if/else blocks. If/else statements are written in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you miss out the curly braces, only the first statement after the if/else is considered part of the if/else block.</p>

<p>Change your code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>public double transferSavingToChecking(double Tamount2) {
    //check if enough to transfer
    if(Tamount2 &gt; Saving_Balance) {
        System.out.println("Transfer failed. You don't have enough     balance in the saving account!");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You have successfully transferred $" +     Tamount2 + " from the saving account to the checking account");
        Saving_Balance=Saving_Balance - Tamount2;
        Checking_Balance=Checking_Balance + Tamount2;
    }
    return Checking_Balance;
}
</code></pre>
