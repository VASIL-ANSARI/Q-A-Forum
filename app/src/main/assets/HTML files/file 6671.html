<p>you can't get a handle to the window because it isn't an instance variable of the current window. You can get a reference to the window by using <code>window.open()</code> and storing the resulting handle in variable.</p>

  <p>What i've tried so far is:
  mainWindow[functionname] to obtain a
  pointer to the js function, but it
  always returns null, even if the page
  was loaded completely. (Does this
  happen because the javascript source
  is included from a seperate file?</p>

<p>It doesn't matter where the file is included from, the function comes into being in the browser's mind when its definition is executed.</p>

<p>To make the link 'clickable' you can just call it with the window handle:</p>

<pre><code>var myWindow = window.open("foo.html");

&lt;a href="javascript:myWindow.functionname('parm1', 'parm2');"&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we shouldn't be using inline javascript, but its ok for a quick example. :)</p>
