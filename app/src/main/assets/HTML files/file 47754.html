<p>It seems to be a problem with the plugin implementation due to a package change in should 7.x.x:</p>

<p>There's an open pull request for this:
<a href="https://github.com/seegno/karma-should/pull/1" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/seegno/karma-should/pull/1</a></p>

<p>The current plugin version (0.0.1) works up to should 6.x.x.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The latest karma-should plugin release (1.0.0) corrects this issue.</p>
