<p>You can't have multiple elements with the same ID in one HTML document. IDs (identifiers) are supposed to be unique. Look into <code>name</code> or <code>class</code> and selecting multiple elements using <code>document.getElementsByName</code> or <code>document.getElementsByClassName</code>.<br>
Alternatively, if your HTML is generated from PHP as well, display / hide the buttons in the HTML directly.</p>
