<p>I stand corrected - see the comments below. I won't change any of my original post, as that would remove the context of the responses. I thank the commenters for their input, and for being so kind as to not vote me down</p>

<p>Consider templating to be like the macro pre-processor, which expands #defines before the compiler gets to see them. </p>

<p>The compiler will "expand" your template parameters and then look at your function declarations. So, template parameter == function parameter. If you declare the same function twice, you will get an error.  </p>

<p>You ask about return type. That is part of the function's 'signature'. Two functions with the same parameters but different return types are two different functions.</p>
