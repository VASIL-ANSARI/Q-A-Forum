<p>There is something weird about this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a JSON file created by the REST API and I need to post data into it using Angular $http.post().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are posting data to Django, you need to have a view and URL routing defined for that view. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def page(request):
    if request.POST:
          .... do stuff with POST data
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that you have to POST data to a view, if there is a simple JSON file on your filesystem, you can't add data by POSTING json to it. </p>
