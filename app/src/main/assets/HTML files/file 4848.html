<p>Your error states:</p>

<pre><code> Could not find 'gcal4ruby (= 0.0.5, runtime)' in any of the gem sources Try running 'bundle install'.
</code></pre>

<p>It's looking for <code>0.0.5</code> of gcal4ruby, which you don't have installed, rather you're saying yourself that the <code>gem list -d</code> shows:</p>

<pre><code> gcal4ruby (0.5.5) 
</code></pre>

<p>Which is <em>not</em> the correct version. I would recommend attempting to discover what's trying to require this older version of <code>gcal4ruby</code>. I think it's in your <code>Gemfile</code>, but I have been known to be wrong occasionally.</p>

<p>If this answer doesn't solve your question, then please attach the errors you're getting and your <code>Gemfile</code> to your question.</p>
