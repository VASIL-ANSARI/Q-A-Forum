<p>This function will copy the specified file to the console line by line (in case you later on decide to give it the ability to use the <code>-n</code> command line option of cat)</p>

<pre><code>def catfile(fn):
  with open(fn) as f:
    for line in f:
      print line,
</code></pre>

<p>It can be called with the filename once you have established the file exists.</p>
