<p>You have a global function which is also a global variable. Globals are generally a bad thing because they eat up your namespace and cause naming collisions.</p>

<p>If you're not worried about that you can let JSLint know which globals you are using by adding the following comment to the top of each file you lint:</p>

<pre><code>/*globals random_num, $ */
</code></pre>

<p>I've added <code>$</code> to demonstrate that you can provide a list of globals.</p>

<p>However since you're using Node I'd recommend adding this to a <code>Utils</code> module. JSLint will not complain about that since you'll be declaring the module with <code>var</code>.</p>

<p>utils.js</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
  random_num: function random_num($value) {
    $result = Math.floor(Math.random() * $value);
    return $result;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Elsewhere:</p>

<pre><code>var utils = require('./utils');
utils.random_num();
</code></pre>
