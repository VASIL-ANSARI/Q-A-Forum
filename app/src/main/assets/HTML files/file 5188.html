<p>The easy way, assuming you're not allowed to use external libraries, is with bubblesort. Write a function that determines if an array of <code>struct student</code>s is already sorted. Then write a function that walk through such an array, comparing adjacent pairs of students. If they're out of order, swap them. Use the first function's result as the conditional clause of a while loop and the second function as the body.</p>

<p>If you are allowed to use it, then <code>qsort()</code> from <code>stdlib.h</code> is by far the best approach.</p>
