<p>If I take your question literally (i.e. invoke <code>doGet()</code> from <code>doPost()</code>), you can just invoke the <code>doGet()</code> method... it's a standard method like any other.</p>

<p>Here's a tip: When the <code>doPost()</code> and <code>doGet()</code> methods share a common set of logic, it's a good practice to isolate that logic into a separate (private) method that is to be invoked by all relevant <code>do***()</code> methods. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
  // GET-based logic
  processCommonLogic();
  // Other GET-based logic
}

public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
  // POST-based logic
  processCommonLogic();
  // Other POST-based logic
}

private void processCommonLogic() /* throws ServletException and/or IOException if needed */ {
  // Common logic
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can use this pattern to create a <code>processError()</code> method that can be invoked wherever you need it.</p>

<p>However, if the scope your question goes beyond invoking <code>doGet()</code> from <code>doPost()</code>, I suggest you have a look at the references pointed by Alain O'Dea.</p>
