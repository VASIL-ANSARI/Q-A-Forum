<p>I was able to fix this by changing the Query to also have an <code>Include</code> with the items table using my Navigation Property: </p>

<p>so I changed this line</p>

<pre><code>OrderInfo = c.OrderInfo.Where(x =&gt; x.OrderID == ID).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>To</p>

<pre><code>OrderInfo = c.OrderInfo.Include("Item").Where(x =&gt; x.OrderID == ID).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>and then it all worked fine.</p>
