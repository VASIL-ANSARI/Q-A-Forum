<p>A ready to use mechanism doesn't exist since the <code>adjacency_list</code> concept cannot <em>know</em> that you wanna access your vertex property by a field in a struct.</p>

<p>I would prefer the way of having an additional map which maps the name of the data to the corresponding vertex. Further, you can encapsulate your algorithm in a class or a function, so that when adding a new vertex the map is filled automatically.</p>
