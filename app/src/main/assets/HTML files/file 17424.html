<p>Python assigns <em>everything</em> by reference. The <code>=</code> operator simply binds the name on the left side to the object on the right side. This only becomes obvious to most people when mutable objects are used on the right side, and then mutated by calling instance methods like <code>.append()</code>.</p>
