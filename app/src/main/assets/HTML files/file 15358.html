<p>According to <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt" rel="nofollow">RFC 1738</a>, <code>/super-action?q=%40tags+"CinÃ©ma+Whatever"</code> is not valid inside an URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
     reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
     unencoded within a URL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that you <em>can't</em> produce a valid URL with that substring in it. You <strong>must</strong> encode the special characters <code>"</code> and <code>Ã©</code>, otherwise the resulting string is not a URL.</p>

<p>The reason why you <em>think</em> this is valid might be that your browser plays tricks on you: It could be displaying the URL in partially encoded form to make it easier to read in the address bar. Try using a protocol analyzer like Wireshark to inspect the <em>actual</em> URL path sent across the network.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I quickly confirmed this, the HTTP header sent in reaction to a form submit is the following:</p>

<pre><code>GET /?q=%40tags+%22Cin%C3%A9ma+Whatever%22 HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>

<p>So it is first UTF-8 encoded and then URL encoded.</p>
