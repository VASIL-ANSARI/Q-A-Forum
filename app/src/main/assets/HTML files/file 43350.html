<p>As noted above OpenCL CPU devices are not supported by any particular vendor on Android. As such, if you have an Android device that does support OpenCL on the GPU, you could used one of the following options to integrate the CPU:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a simple thread pool to manage CPU threads</li>
<li>Use Qualcomm's MARE tasking runtime*, which provides an integrated view of the  CPU and GPU, including access to OpenCL within a single framework. </li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you could use Renderscript which can provide CPU and GPU support but limited in functionality compared to OpenCL and/or MARE. </p>

<ul>
