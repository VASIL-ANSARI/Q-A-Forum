<p>All methods of ConcurrentDictionary are safe to be called from multiple threads.</p>

<p>It does not guarantees that other parts of your program need no synchronization as you may need to use locks to access other object/multiple objects at the same time.</p>

<p>I.e. your sample code does lock for both retrieving a task and executing it. It shows an example of locking to access multiple object atomically. </p>

<p>Side note: you should review your lock for <code>task.Execute()</code> as it prohibits other threads to execute task in parallel. It may be what you want to achieve, but in this case using ConcurrentDictionary may be overkill.</p>
