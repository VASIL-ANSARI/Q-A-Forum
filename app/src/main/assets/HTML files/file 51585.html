<p>The <code>BlueDotView</code> (here: <a href="https://github.com/IndoorAtlas/android-sdk-examples/blob/master/Basic/src/main/java/com/indooratlas/android/sdk/examples/imageview/BlueDotView.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/IndoorAtlas/android-sdk-examples/blob/master/Basic/src/main/java/com/indooratlas/android/sdk/examples/imageview/BlueDotView.java</a>) in IndoorAtlas's example extends <code>SubsamplingScaleImageView</code> by Dave Morissey (here: <a href="https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view</a>). <code>SubsamplingScaleImageView</code> does not extend <code>android.widget.ImageView</code> and hence you cannot use it directly as load target: <code>Picasso.with(this).load(url).into(mImageView)</code> but you need to use <code>Target</code> just as you did.</p>

<p>What comes to <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Canvas: trying to use a recycled bitmap android.graphics.Bitmap@1d21751f</code> this is because <code>SubsamplingScaleImageView</code> does not work out-of-the-box with most image loading libraries. Read more here: <a href="https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view/wiki/X.-Using-with-Picasso" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view/wiki/X.-Using-with-Picasso</a>. That link also explains the proper way of mixing <code>SubsamplingScaleImageView</code> with Picasso. The quick hack is to pass a copy of the <code>Bitmap</code> to image view:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBitmapLoaded(Bitmap bitmap, Picasso.LoadedFrom from) {
     mImageView.setImage(ImageSource.bitmap(bitmap.copy(bitmap.getConfig(), true));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This may be ok for small bitmaps that don't change often but is waste of resources for large bitmaps and can cause OOM exceptions.</p>

<p>It looks like your are resizing your bitmap to 500x500 pixels. If your original floor plan bitmap was not square (?) you are changing aspect ratio and positioning blue dot correctly will fail. To set e.g. width of your bitmap to 500px and still maintain aspect ratio, use: <code>resize(500, 0)</code>.</p>
