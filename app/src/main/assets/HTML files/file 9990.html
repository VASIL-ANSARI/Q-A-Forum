<p>You have to get jScrollPane attached to a load event, otherwise it tries to apply itself to content before it has loaded. jScrollPane doesn't "see" the whole content, because the content hasn't loaded completely yet, and "thinks" that it's not needed. When you come back from another page, the entire content has loaded, and jScrollPane applies itself. </p>

<p>It all boils down to this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
$(window).load(function() {
    $('.lista_exitos').jScrollPane();
}); 
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend using $(window).load wrapper whenever you use jScrollPane. </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
