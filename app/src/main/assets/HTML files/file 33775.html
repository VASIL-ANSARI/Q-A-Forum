<p>If the program counter jumps back to 0 unexpectedly, the PIC is resetting. There are many causes of reset, depending on the PIC. A common one is watchdog timeout, and you don't seem to be kicking the watchdog, so have you disabled it in the config bits? Status register bit 4 will tell you if a watchdog timeout occurred.</p>
