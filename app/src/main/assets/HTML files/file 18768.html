<p>Like the first comment says you can't hide them from the user, if they really want to see it, they will see it. 
You can clean them up in a way if you really wanted to, something like</p>

<pre><code>var mySpace = {};
mySpace.init = function() {
    // your init functions here
};
</code></pre>

<p>in doc ready you just call</p>

<pre><code>mySpace.init();
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if this is what you wanted but it is the way I understood the question</p>
