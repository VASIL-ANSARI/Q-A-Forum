<p>If you have a database, make a users table,<br> then connect to the database in the file you're working with, and query out the user based on the id and assign it to a variable ex.($username). <br> Then you can replace the "my name is '[lol]' " to "my name is '$username' ". <br> I suppose this would work, if i understood your question right.</p>
