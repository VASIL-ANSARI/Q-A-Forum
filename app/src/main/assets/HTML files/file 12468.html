<p>gettext only deals with one string at a time.
What you may be after is ngettext. (look it up for syntax)</p>

<p>There, you'll put in one text for singular, another for plural, but also the number.</p>

<p>The smart thing about this is, that many languages have a totally different plural structure, than English.
Russian, for instance, uses three different forms.
One is for where the count ends in a pronounced 'one':
1, 21, 31, 41 etc.
The second form is for counts, which end in a pronounced 2, 3 or 4.
The third form is for the rest...</p>

<p>And, with ngettext, this can be done.
Yeah, in poedit, one has to correctly define the target language's plural structure, but then, it just works.</p>
