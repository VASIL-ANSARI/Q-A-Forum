<p>It is difficult to make a real variadic macro to work in VS2013. I had something done to expand a macro to be interpreted on it's own as a new macro. The key is to make multiple level macros. It is a lot to code but for given sample it will work.</p>

<pre><code>#define InitialMacro (argument1, argument2) \
DetailedMacro(argument1, argument2, argument1##_description, argument2##_description)

#define DetailedMacro (argument1, argument2, argument3, argument4)      \
L#argument1     \
L#argument2     \
L#argument3     \
L#argument4
</code></pre>

<p>The ideea presented here is to implement enough macros to cover all your requirement in the number of parameters nedeed. Also you can forward/update macro with aditional items on the way.
Basically first macro in this example append to the second and third transmitted parameters the suffix _description resulting in another macro that will get interpreted as a macro and it will be expanded in DetailedMacro.</p>
