<p>You only need to solve half  of it and put same number in the mirror image by changing the indices.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill the diagonal</li>
<li>Loop through rows: r = 1 -> colmax -1 //square matrix!

<ul>
<li>Loop c = r -> colmax-1 times again</li>
<li>set value at [c][c+1] = [c][c-1] + [c][c+1]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The index at [c][c+1] runs parallel to the diagonal with offset r.</p>

<p>The index at [c][c-1] is is the previous value in the row</p>

<p>The index at [c+1][c+1] is the next value in the column</p>

<p>After you are done, fill the other half by copying what you calculated.</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>
