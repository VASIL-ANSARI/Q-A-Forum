<pre><code>float *planeCoefA, *planeCoefB, *planeCoefC, *planeCoefD = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>You have not initialized any of your pointers.  <code>planeCoefA</code>, <code>planeCoefB</code>, and <code>planeCoefC</code> will have random values.  Only <code>planeCoefD</code> is assigned <code>NULL</code>, but that's not valid to write to either. </p>

<p>However, you proceed to just assign values to those memory locations anyway.  This is undefined behavior.  Pointers are variables and their values are memory addresses.  However, they do not automatically point at valid memory; they need to be initialized.</p>

<pre><code>float planeCoefA = 0, planeCoefB = 0, planeCoefC = 0, planeCoefD = 0;

// ...

void calculatePlaneEQ (&lt;...&gt;, float *myXnorm, float *myYnorm, float *myZnorm, float* myD)
</code></pre>

<p>The only reason to add another level of indirection (i.e., <code>float**</code> v <code>float*</code>) is if you need to modify <em>the argument</em> such that it can be seen by the caller (because, remember; you're passing these arguments <em>by value</em>).  You simply need to write to the memory location that the pointers refer to, so a single pointer is sufficient.</p>
