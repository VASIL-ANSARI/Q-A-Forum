<p>You don't need cursors for this type validation.  Here are three queries that do this:</p>

<p>Projects with no tasks:</p>

<pre><code>select p.*
from tbl_projects p left outer join
     tbl_tasks t
     on p.project_id = t.project_id
where t.project_id is null;
</code></pre>

<p>Tasks have at least one assignment:</p>

<pre><code>select p.*
from tbl_tasks t left outer join
     tbl_assignments a
     on a.task_id = t.task_id
where a.task_id is null;
</code></pre>

<p>All assignments have at least one document:</p>

<pre><code>select p.*
from tbl_assignments a left outer join
     tbl_documents d
     on a.assignment_id = d.assignment_id
where d.assignment_id is null;
</code></pre>
