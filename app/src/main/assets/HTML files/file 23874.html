<p>It's not clear what you're after.</p>

<p>First off, <code>@Ignore</code> is for telling the JUnit test runner to ignore the test. You didn't mention testing in your question, but we should be clear that that is what <code>@Ignore</code> is for. Test runners in .NET have similar attributes (e.g., in xUnit, the attribute is <code>[Ignore]</code>).</p>

<p>So, if you're using a test runner, find the corresponding attribute for that test runner. If you're not using a test runner, what exactly are you after given that <code>@Ignore</code> is germane only to test running?</p>

<p>Are you writing your own test runner? Why? There are <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">plenty</a> of <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" rel="nofollow">really</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/" rel="nofollow">good</a> free test runners available. Use them! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want the attribute to <strong>suppress the execution even if the method is called</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that's a code smell if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>You have a few options.</p>

<p>Insert code into <strong>every</strong> method that you apply <code>[Ignore]</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]
public class Ignore : Attribute { }

[Ignore]
public static void M() {
    var ignoreAttributes =
        MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().GetCustomAttributes(typeof(Ignore), true);
    if (ignoreAttributes.Any()) {
        return;
    }
    // method execution proceeds
    // do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can use an <a href="http://docs.castleproject.org/Default.aspx?Page=Interceptors&amp;NS=Windsor&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" rel="nofollow">interception technique</a>.</p>

<p>Or, you can use a <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/" rel="nofollow">post-compilation</a> framework.</p>

<p><em>ALL</em> of these have very serious problems. They have problems because what you're doing is a code smell. </p>
