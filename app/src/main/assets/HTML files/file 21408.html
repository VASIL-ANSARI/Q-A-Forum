<p>Arrays cannot have string keys in JavaScript. Only objects can.</p>

<p>If you want to see if an object contains has a key <code>banana</code>, you can simply test that it isn't <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (myObject.banana != undefined) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>... or use <code>hasOwnProperty</code>, which may be better in cases when you may have initialized a property to <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (myObject.hasOwnProperty("banana")) {

}
</code></pre>
