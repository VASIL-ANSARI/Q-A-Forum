<p>Generally, the rules for popups are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do a window.open outside of a user triggered event, it will be blocked, and display a given message.  In general, popups will work transparently as part of a click event. </li>
<li>If you want a pop-over, leave it be... </li>
<li>if you want a pop-under, simply window.focus() after you do your window.open(...);</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<pre><code>var w = window.open(...);
window.focus();</code></pre>

<p>Note: The target attribute will still work in a browser.  Though, you wouldn't want a link to pop under your current page.</p>
