<p>It's never been case sensitive for me, but I guess that is just how I set my database up. You can definitely use your first option of converting them both to upper case, EF doesn't pull them into memory to do that, just informs SQL server to do it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>string searchTerm = "Some Text";

dbcontext.Table.Where (t =&gt; t.Column.ToLower().Contains(searchTerm.ToLower()));
</code></pre>

<p>Produces the following SQL (ish, i did this with linqtosql but EF should be pretty similar):</p>

<pre><code>-- Region Parameters
DECLARE @p0 NVarChar(1000) = '%some text%'
-- EndRegion
SELECT *
FROM [Table] AS [t0]
WHERE LOWER([t0].[Column]) LIKE @p0
</code></pre>
