<p>If you are building it in android, you would be developing for phones that have to have an IR blaster. 
To control the IR take a look at this link <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/ConsumerIrManager.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/ConsumerIrManager.html</a></p>

<p>Additionally you would need access to a database of IR codes that manufacturers use. This is a good place to start: <a href="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/" rel="nofollow">http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/</a></p>

<p>Edit: So your workflow would be something like this: Get the codes from the repo and use the IR blaster from the phone to control a device.</p>
