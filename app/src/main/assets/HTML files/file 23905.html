<p>IT looks like you're not setting the artist_id on the song anywhere.  You are doing it right though - with a album_id and artist_id, you have to pick one of those as the parent.  It's as though you are caching the artist_id on the song. </p>

<p>I think I would keep things they way you are doing it but add this to the model.</p>

<pre><code>class Song &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  before_save :ensure_artist_id


  def ensure_artist_id
    self.artist_id = self.album.artist_id
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The other option is to set it in the controller explicitly</p>

<pre><code>  def create
    @artist = Artist.find(params[:artist_id])
    @album = Album.find(params[:album_id])
    @song = @album.songs.create(params[:song].merge(:artist_id =&gt; @artist.id)
      if @song.save
        redirect_to artist_album_songs_url
        flash[:success] = "Song Created."
      else
        render 'new'
      end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't feel as clean and may be repeated in other controller methods.  It's nicer to have it in the model.</p>
