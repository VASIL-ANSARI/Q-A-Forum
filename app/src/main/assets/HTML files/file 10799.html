<p>This would work:</p>

<pre><code>persons.SelectMany(p =&gt; p.PersonalEffects.Select(e =&gt; new { Person = p, Effect = e }))
       .ToLookup(o =&gt; o.Effect, o =&gt; o.Person);
</code></pre>

<p>What we 're doing here is essentially a join of persons and effects, creating person+effect pairs (where both specific persons and effects can appear in many pairs each), then grouping these pairs by effect and collecting the persons posessing each effect in an enumerable sequence.</p>
