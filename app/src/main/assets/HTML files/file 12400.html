<p>Well why do you have to update a cell like that... If the cell is out of view, to save memory the system unloads it, and since its not in the view there is no need for you to update the cell directly, rather you should have the state be reflected in such way that when cellForRowIndexPath is called by the table view to load the cell the desired look is shown... The only reason youd want to do what you are doing is if the cell is showing and you need to update the cell, for the user... Even then you can still set your state and call the reloadRowsAtIndexPaths instead of manipulating the cell directly... Hope that helps </p>
