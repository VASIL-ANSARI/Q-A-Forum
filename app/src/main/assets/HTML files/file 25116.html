<p>I am not familiar with the ViewPager, however, every time you call notifyDataSetChanged() the pager will fetch the data from the DB. </p>

<p>Instead of updating the cursor every time the page changes, I would recommend creating a function to check if the dataset has actually changed before making a call to notifyDataSetChanged(). This way you will only have a performance penalty when a user changes data on Page1, but from there onward all page swipes would be instant, until the data is changed again.</p>

<p>Hope this helps your problem.</p>
