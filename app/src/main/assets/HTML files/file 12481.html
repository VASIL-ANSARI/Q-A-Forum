<p>You could use your <code>Index</code> action result to load a template of the screen and use AJAX to get and load the actual data.</p>

<pre><code>[OutputCache(CacheProfile = "VideoIndexView")]
public ActionResult Index()
{
    ...
    return View(model);  // Really only return a model that is okay to be cached
}

public ActionResult LoadData ()
{
    var Result = // Load the data
    ...
    return Json(Result);  // Don't forget to allow GET here if you're using HTTPGET
}

// Or...

public ActionResult LoadData ()
{
    var Result = // Load the data
    ...
    return PartialView (Result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, <code>Index</code> can be cached just fine and the data will be loaded and injected into the page after the page has been served to the user.  If you are going to use something like jQuery, be sure to tell it not to use cached results if you're using GET.</p>
