<p>So...you want to refactor the Form1.designer.cs file?</p>

<p>Anything you do to "clean up" would place an unnecessary burden on the CPU just for the sake of "clean code". Just let the designer be (unless you're talking repeat designs, in which case a user control may be the way to go).</p>

<p><em>Those are my impressions on this, anyways</em></p>
