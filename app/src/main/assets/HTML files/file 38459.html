<p>I'm going to say no. An API spec is <em>entirely</em> up to the company that owns the website (Instagram). So in order to query two tags, they would have to build that into their server as a feature. </p>

<p>You could create your own intermediary server that your iOS app connects to, however, if you really want just one API call on the iOS device.</p>

<p>iOS -> Your server -> makes two calls, one for each tag -> Instagram's server</p>
