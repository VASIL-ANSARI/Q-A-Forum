<p><code>&lt;rant&gt;</code> Although, I would avoid using Magic Numbers at any cost. Just imagine you will need to support this service later and how are you supposed to remeber all those digits... <code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code> </p>

<p>Anyway, you mat try telling SS to use UseBclJsonSerializers. In your AppHost configure method add this: </p>

<pre><code>SetConfig(new HostConfig{
     // ...
     UseBclJsonSerializers = true,
     // ...
});
</code></pre>
