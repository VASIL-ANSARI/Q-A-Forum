<p>From your description, it sounds like you are authenticating into the web page with the same account that needs to be unlocked.  This would be a catch-22.  You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make the account unlock page completely unauthenticated. This would allow anyone access, so that needs to be considered. If it is only hosted on the intranet, that would at least reduce outside attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow people to select a different user than themselves to unlock.  This way a user could go to a coworkers desk and access the page.  Alternatively this could be used by the HR Dept.</p></li>
</ol>
