<p>@zapl already answered you, I'll delete this answer if he will post his comments as an answer.</p>

<p>When you write</p>

<pre><code> &lt;result type="json"&gt;grid.jsp&lt;/result&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>it will be translated to</p>

<pre><code> &lt;result name="success" type="json"&gt;&lt;/result&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>"success"</code> will be added because of Intelligent Default ("success" is taken if no name specified) and the entire Action will be serialized into JSON, because <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17149414/1654265">that's how the JSON plugin works</a>. You can specify a <code>root</code> object, but you can't specify a JSP, because JSP != JSON, and because raw text (like a jsp name) is not expected to be found there in the config. Your <code>grid.jsp</code> will be simply ignored and cropped at all (not tested, but I'm pretty sure).</p>
