<p>Found a solution!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx/wiki" rel="nofollow">AsyncEx</a> provides the AsyncLock and AsyncMonitor classes, which not only solve the problem of Monitor.Wait only handling requesters, it allows for yielding up control of the thread within the asynchronous lock itself! And even better, the default wait queue logic is FIFO guaranteed. This will satisfy all 3 requirements I had for throttling UI updates so that other UI work can be interspersed and keep UI responsive.</p>
