<p>The error is that no dataSource or jdbcTemplate is wired into the JdbcCountryDao bean: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'dataSource' or 'jdbcTemplate' is required</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However your XML config shows that you have the dataSource sent, so are you sure that this error occurs when using the posted version of the file?</p>

<p>Also, there is no need to have declare a <code>@Autowired jdbcTemplate</code> in a class that extends <code>JdbcDaoSupport</code> as the superclass provides this for you already.</p>
