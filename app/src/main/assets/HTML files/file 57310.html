<p><strong>Please revoke the access token that you pasted and create a new one as people can use that to access your account.</strong></p>

<p>You are receiving the stated error because you are pasting C# code into POSTMAN which POSTMAN cannot handle. You will need to use <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio</a> if you want to run C# code.</p>

<p>If you would like to use POSTMAN you can only send one request at a time to a specific URL. For example, if you want to get information about your current user you would tell POSTMAN to go the <a href="https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me" rel="nofollow">https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me</a> endpoint (step 1 below) using your token (step 2 below) then click "Send". Here is a screenshot of what that will look like:</p>
