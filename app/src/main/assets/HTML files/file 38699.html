<p>Not quite answering your question but kinda fixing the problem you weren't even asking about in the first place (I think):</p>

<pre><code>preg_match($csscomments, $stringcontainingyourCSS?, $matches);
$sourcecode = array();
foreach ($matches as $match) {
    array_push($sourcecode, "&lt;span class='csscomments'&gt;" . $match . "&lt;/span&gt;");
}
</code></pre>
