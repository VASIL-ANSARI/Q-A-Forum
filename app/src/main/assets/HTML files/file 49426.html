<p>I would think the simplest way would be to make sure you know the time the cache was created. When you make changes, save the current state of the page in localStorage, along with the time of the cache. When you load the page, you get the cached data, check it's time to see if it is more recent than your localStorage version. If it is, use the cache, if not, reload your data from localStorage since it has the cached data PLUS your changes already.</p>
