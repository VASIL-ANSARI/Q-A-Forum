<p>Don't know if it was ever fixed, but I worked around this issue by actually modifying the font family names inside the .ttf files, using vim editor. Because you have different font-types (Bold and Medium) but actually the same fontfamily (MyFont) - the system mixes them up.  So what I did in the first file - I actually modified the family to be MyFontA, and in the second file MyFontB (of course I had different names - these are just to match the example above).
This worked perfect.</p>
