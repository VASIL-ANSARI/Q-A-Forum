<blockquote>
  <p>Magic quotes may be enabled or disabled in the php.ini file simply by changing the value of the magic_quotes_gpc from On to Off, or Off to On. If you do not have access to the php.ini file, inquire with the System administrator for your host and ask about having Magic quotes turned on or off. This may be done on a per-directory basis with the proper configuration.</p>
