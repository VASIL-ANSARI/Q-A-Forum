<p>Both of these should have worked, so I think you may have a problem accessing "isFestival". You should try the bean syntax <code>$artist.festival</code> or the method syntax <code>$artist.isFestival()</code> (you are now using a mix of both).
The method returns a boolean, right?</p>

<p>For debugging try to just print out the result to see if it works:</p>

<pre><code> $artist            ## see if the artist is defined
 $artist.IsFestival  ## maybe an error   
 $artist.festival    ## should be true or false
 $artist.isFestival() ## should be true or false
</code></pre>

<p>Update: Just read that you are asking about nVelocity. It is possible that my answer only applies to the Java version. Give it a try anyway.</p>
