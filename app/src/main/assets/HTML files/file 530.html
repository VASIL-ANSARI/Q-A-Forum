<p>What I would do is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The constraint is CASCADE</li>
<li>The application checks if preferences exist.</li>
<li>If they do, show the warning.</li>
<li>If no preferences exist, or the warning is accepted, delete the client.</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing database relationships on the fly is not going to be a good idea!!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
