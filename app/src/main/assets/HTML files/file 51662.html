<p>Thanks for the responses. Found the answer: the issue was coming from improper memory allocation. The condition</p>

<pre><code>queue[queueEnd] == NULL
</code></pre>

<p>was never actually being met, which was a misunderstanding of memory allocation on my part. To fix it, I removed the block of code allocating memory and instead just passed in a <code>char **</code> with all of its pointer elements already initialized.</p>
