<p>You need to call invokeAll in order to split you work in two pieces instead of doing it manually, then 2 new threads would be created to 'compute' your result, and then if it's not small enough 2 new threads and so on..,</p>

<p>You can't predict in what order thread would be executed so the messages order would vary every time you run this code.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyRecursiveAction extends RecursiveAction {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRecursiveAction mra1 = new MyRecursiveAction(100);
        ForkJoinPool fjp1 = new ForkJoinPool();
        fjp1.invoke(mra1);
    }

    private long workLoad = 0;

    public MyRecursiveAction(long workLoad) {
        this.workLoad = workLoad;
    }

    @Override
    protected void compute() {

        //if work is above threshold, break tasks up into smaller tasks
        if(this.workLoad &gt; 16) {
            System.out.println("Splitting workLoad : " + this.workLoad);

            invokeAll(new MyRecursiveAction(this.workLoad / 2), new MyRecursiveAction(this.workLoad / 2));

        } else {
            System.out.println("Doing workLoad myself: " + this.workLoad);
        }
    }

}
