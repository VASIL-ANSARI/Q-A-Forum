<p>Take a look at <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/instant-payment-notification/" rel="nofollow">Instant Payment Notification (IPN)</a>.  </p>

<p>Each time a transaction occurs on your PayPal account, PayPal will send a POST request of the transaction data to a URL that you specify.  </p>

<p>Your script / URL can receive that data and process it however you need to.  It happens automatically, and in most cases instantly when the transaction occurs.  </p>

<p>You can build updates to your database, email notifications, hits to 3rd party web services, etc. into an IPN solution.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>For those using the REST API then instead of IPN you would use <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/rest/webhooks/" rel="nofollow">Webhooks</a>.  They're technically the same thing, but function slightly differently.  </p>
