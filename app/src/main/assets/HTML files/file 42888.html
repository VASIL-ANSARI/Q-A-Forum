<p>It depends on what <code>QWidget</code> does with the pointer it is given. It is perfectly fine to pass around a reference or pointer to a half-constructed object as long as the called code does not access the underlying object.  You need to look into the documentation of <code>QWidget</code> to know whether it touches the object or just stores the pointer.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the particular case of Qt, reading the documentation, it is calling the constructor of <code>QWidget</code>, the argument is of type <code>QWidget*</code>, and <code>this</code> is only used to cast to the base pointer. Obtaining the pointer to the base is guaranteed in 12.7/3 as the requirement for the conversion is that <em>the construction of X and the construction of all of its direct or indirect bases that directly or indirectly derive from B shall have started</em>. The pointer is then passed to the <code>QWidget</code> constructor that may use it in any way it wants, since the constructor for the base <code>QWidget</code> has already completed before the constructor for the <code>mpAnotherWidget</code> starts.</p>
