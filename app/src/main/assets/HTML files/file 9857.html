<p>there are a few ways of combining results from multiple queries.</p>

<ol>
<li>UNION ALL  -- lets you literally combine results between query1 UNION ALL query2</li>
<li>Make 1 more general query. -- this is the best answer if it can be done.</li>
<li>Join Sub queries and print the data horizontally if you can join them. select a.<em>, b.</em> from (querya) a join (queryb) b on (id)</li>
<li>There are probably other ways as well. Such as a stored procedure etc.</li>
</ol>
