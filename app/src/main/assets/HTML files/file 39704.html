<p>I faced this issue few times and have tried many workarounds.
what worked for me is,</p>

<ol>
<li>Start debugging your application (F5)</li>
<li>open your global.asax file (its global.asax not global.asax.cs)</li>
<li>change something in that file (put some whitespace or something and save it)</li>
<li>now refresh your page in your browser.</li>
<li>you'll see your application_start will hit breakpoints.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Clear temp directory</li>
<li>Restart IIS (go to command prompt and say iisreset)</li>
<li>Start debugging of your application</li>
<li>Then attach your application with the process.</li>
</ol>
