<p>Given that there is no straightforward way to display pdfs inline in a similar manner to images, you could consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>cfpdf action = "thumbnail"</code> to <a href="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/cfpdf" rel="nofollow">convert the pdf to a series of images</a>.</li>
<li>Then, load the images for a given pdf in a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19405322/what-is-the-best-jquery-carousel-plugin-to-apply-to-a-list-of-posts">jquery carousel</a> to make them available to review.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a carousel to contain and display the pages of the 'pdf' would give you a result similar to when you display a single image for review and would probably let you retain a similar look and feel to your page.</p>
