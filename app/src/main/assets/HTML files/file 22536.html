<p>Why not use the Java Client libraries Amazon provides for MWS?</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://developer.amazonservices.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">MWS</a> and click on the API you are interested in. You will see a Java Client library link where you can go and get the files you need. They contain examples and will handle the URL signing, parsing, and other work you would normally have to do yourself.</p>
