<p>the failure message is supposed to add context to the failure message. So anything that saves you having to drill into the test code to know what failed.</p>

<p>So if the [method name, expected, actual] set is adequate for the above purpose, you can skip the failure message. If you need more information, then you add the optional failure message.</p>

<p>e.g. 
<code>Expected true but was false</code>, doesn't tell me anything. </p>

<p>You can use a failure message so that
<code>Return value should contain only multiples of 10. Expected true but was false</code></p>

<p>You can first try to use more descriptive matchers.
So that failures read <code>Expected all items to be divisible by 10 but was [10,20,35,40]</code> does. </p>

<p>Personally I prefer matchers... use failure messages as the last resort. (because like comments, it decays. You need discipline to ensure that the failure message is updated if you change the check.)</p>
