<p>If you have two <code>Person</code> instances that have the same name but different occupation and you consider them to be the same person then you'll need to tell JVM that if two names are equal then those to people are also equal. THat you do by overriding <code>equals()</code></p>

<p>Now the second step is to update the list so that once you try to add a <code>Person</code> which already exist in the list (i.e. there is a person that has the same name) then you add the new occupation onto the old one (e.g. by string concatenation).</p>

<p>You don't need any libraries for what you want to do, just need to write complete classes. :) </p>
