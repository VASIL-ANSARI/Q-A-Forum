<p>I know this is an outdated issue, but you may want to look at this recent SO question.  It details how I ran into a similar issue and how it was resolved:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36707775/upgrading-to-ruby-2-3-0-nameerror-uninitialized-constant-i18nconfigbackend">upgrading to ruby 2.3.0 NameError: uninitialized constant I18n::Config::Backend</a></p>

<p>Look through your rake files and see if you have any references to the Translation helper.</p>

<p>Removing include <code>ActionView::Helpers::TranslationHelper</code> and replacing <code>(t "some_text")</code> with <code>(I18n.t "some_text")</code> completely resolved the issue. </p>
