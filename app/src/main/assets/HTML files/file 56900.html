<p>It seems that what I am looking for doesn't exist. Django trusts the user to deal with migrations and such and doesn't check the database on load. So there is no place in the system where you can load some data on system start and be sure that you can actually load it. What I ended up doing is loading the data in ready(), but do a sanity check first by doing MyModel.objects.exist() in a try: except: block and returning if there was an exception. This is not ideal, but I haven't found any other way.</p>
