<p>I guess you could use a triply-"nested" set comprehension. </p>

<pre><code>rooms = {roomtype
         for service  in otas
         for location in otas[service]
         for roomtype in otas[service][location]}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want a list back, just wrap that in a call to <code>list</code>.</p>
