<p>See the wxPython demo for the StyledTextCtrl. It shows how to do this exact thing. I think the bit you're looking for is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ed.StartStyling(190, 0xff)
ed.SetStyling(20, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Where 190 is the 190th character and you set the style for the next 20 characters. </p>
