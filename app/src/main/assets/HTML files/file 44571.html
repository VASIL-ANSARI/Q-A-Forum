<p>You can use the regex feature of NetBean's <code>Find in Projects</code> function, accessible via <strong><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></strong>.</p>

<p>A regex such as <code>catch\s*{</code> should be sufficient to take you to all of your catch blocks through repeated iterations, and with the line you want to add placed in your clipboard, you can add it easily to the block with copy + paste.</p>

<p>If you averaged even a few seconds for each replacement, the whole process would take you less than ten minutes.</p>
