<p>The only thing I can think of, to minimize the jump effect on your text, is to set <code>min-height</code> to where the image will appear, I would say - set it to the "shorter" image you know of. This way the jump will be less evident and you won't need to use lazyLoad or so... However it doesn't completely fix your problem.</p>
