<p>I assume the code will be running on the OS X side.</p>

<p>OS X has a single root node for the file system <code>/</code>.  Everything else comes under that root node.  For example, a <code>document.doc</code> in your home folder would be referred like <code>/Users/Long/document.doc</code>.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of where a file is located then you can follow these steps to find out:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Locate the container folder in Finder</li>
<li>Open a new terminal window

<ul>
<li>Type <kbd>c</kbd><kbd>d</kbd><kbd>{space}</kbd></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drag the folder from Finder into terminal</li>
<li>Press <kbd>{return}</kbd></li>
<li>Type <kbd>p</kbd><kbd>w</kbd><kbd>d</kbd><kbd>{return}</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>This will change the current working directory to the one you drug into finder, then pwd will print the working directory out (on screen) so you can see what the path should look like.</p>
