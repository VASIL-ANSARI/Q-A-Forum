<li>Scroll view and its subclasses are really bad at handling opacity. If there's a solid background, try to avoid subviews with opaque backgrounds if possible. It could make huge difference in scroll performance</li>
<li>Make sure that loading data for subsequent pages is made in background</li>
<li>Reuse views and view controllers. There's no need to instantiate a new view controller when you can just update model on the existing one. Make a pool of several (3-5) pages and move them around, just like UITableView do</li>
<li>You can always run Profiler to find the bottleneck</li>
</ol>

<p>But anyway, I bet you just block the main thread (which is responsible for updating UI) with fetching data and loading new view controllers</p>
