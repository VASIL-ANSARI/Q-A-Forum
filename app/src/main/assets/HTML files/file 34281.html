<p>Use a single table to hold all levels. You can do this by adding a ParentMenuId column (NULLABLE) which will reference the MenuId (of the same table). Top level menu items will have a ParentMenuId = NULL.</p>

<p>This type of implementation may seem complex in other contexts, but it really ideal here, where you will always access one single submenu at a time.</p>
