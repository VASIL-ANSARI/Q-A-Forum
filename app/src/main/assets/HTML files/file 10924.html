<p>The .Value return is a decimal as the error is stating and it is trying to convince that it will not do an imlicit conversion from decimal to int which I assume your values on the Role object are.  You would be best to do a int.Parse(...) on your numericUpDown objects or better yet an int.TryParse(...) and check the return to see if it could accurately parse the decimal value into an int which it should be able to.</p>
