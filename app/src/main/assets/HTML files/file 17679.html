<p>The primary responsibility of controllers in Ember apps are to present data to the view to render.</p>

<p>A good solution for managing dynamic collections of views is to subclass <code>Ember.ContainerView</code> and have it update it's <code>childViews</code> property in response to properties changing on the controller. You can look at the source code for <code>Ember.CollectionView</code> for an example.</p>
