<p>This is a basic constructor within a listener paradigm. It's a core idea within computer science that code should be reusable, and to facilitate this code needs to generally be self contained. This is often done within Java with a listener. It's usually an abstract class or an interface that has a few set functions. The main class that uses the listener is assigned this object or objects, and when it reaches a relevant point will trigger the listener to notify your code of an event.</p>

<p>This allows people to write code that is fully contained and still provide event hooks whereby other user who employ that code can get feedback such as when a menu item is clicked or a new connection is made, and have this dealt with by the person using this code, but without the author of the original class knowing anything about your code. It allows things like menus and connection managers and buttons that have no connection to the code that they trigger, by design. So that any number of these can be made and used.</p>
