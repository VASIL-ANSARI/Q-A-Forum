<h2>Edit, following the question extension</h2>

<p>From his comments, it now appears that the OP targets a more general use, adding <code>\t</code>s to <em>indent all lines</em> between the opening and closing tag.<br>
Then its time to remember that <strong>regex is not a good way to parse HTML</strong>, as frequently observed here.</p>

<p>But in this yet not too wide context we can propose a solution.<br>
Unless somebody finds a better solution, I don't see a way to do it without 2 nested steps:</p>

<pre><code>$updated_text = preg_replace_callback(
    '/(&lt;a[^&gt;]*&gt;)\s*(.*?)\s*(&lt;\/a&gt;)/s',
    function($matches) {
        return $matches[1]
          . "\n" . preg_replace('/([^\n]+)/', "\t$1", $matches[2])
          . "\n" . $matches[3];
    },
    $text
);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, in addition to be a poor way of doing it, it's much time consuming due to the <code>.*?</code> (not greedy) quantifier.  </p>

<h2>Initial answer</h2>

<p>Thanks to the @bobblebubble suggestion I just understood what means "I want add tab" (I previously thought only to browser's tabs :).</p>

<p>But I find its solution a bit too general: it'll add tab to <em>any line</em> which is not a tag!<br>
I'd prefer to closely look for only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, and only when presented like in the OP's example:</p>

<pre><code>$updated_text = preg_replace('/(&lt;a[^&gt;]*&gt;)\s*([^&lt;]*)\s*&lt;\/a&gt;/', '$1\n\t$2&lt;/a&gt;', $text);
</code></pre>
