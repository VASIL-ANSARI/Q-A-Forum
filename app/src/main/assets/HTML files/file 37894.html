<p>You say that Stage2 is loaded at <em>segment</em> <code>0x0200</code>, which is address <code>0x2000</code>, but your linker says it starts at <em>offset</em> <code>0x0200</code>.</p>

<p>Also, despite naming your output "Anmu.<strong>bin</strong>", your file is actually still an ELF executable, which means all of the headers and whatnot are still present in the file. Instead, you need to use <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/objcopy.html" rel="nofollow"><code>objcopy</code></a> to strip all of the headers and debugging symbols, giving you a flat binary:</p>

<pre><code>objcopy -S -O binary Anmu.bin Anmu-flat.bin
</code></pre>

<p>Now, "Anmu-flat.bin" is nothing but code and data, and the first byte of the file is the start of the first instruction.</p>
