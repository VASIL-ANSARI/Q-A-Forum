<p>Solved it. I had tried playing with namespacing before in one place or the other, but apparently both the <code>Mockery::mock</code>, and the <code>app-&gt;instance()</code> need fully namespaced names. This problem hadn't occurred for me in other tests, so I hadn't even considered it. I hope this helps someone else, because this one racked my brain for a while.</p>

<p>Relevant code fixed:</p>

<pre><code>$hash = Mockery::mock('App\Models\Eloquent\HashLogin');
$this-&gt;app-&gt;instance('App\Models\Eloquent\HashLogin', $hash);
</code></pre>
