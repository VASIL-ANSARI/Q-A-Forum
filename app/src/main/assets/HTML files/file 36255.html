<p>as i know That might be Depend on <code>Secure.ANDROID_ID</code> , your <code>Application Packages</code> and your <code>GCM</code> Project Number,</p>

<p>Because i used same <code>Project Number</code> for 2 apps running on the Same Devices but <code>GCM TOKEN</code> was different for both applications, so it might also depends on the <code>Package</code> of you <code>Android Application</code></p>
