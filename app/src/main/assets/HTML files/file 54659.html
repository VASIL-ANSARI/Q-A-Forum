<p>This is not possible in .NET. An array is not a pointer.</p>

<p>You have to use a type other than array for that. If you want to refer to a subsection of an array you can use the <code>ArraySegment&lt;T&gt;</code> type. You also could create a custom <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> that wraps a section of an array.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer will turn out to be that there is no practical way to achieve what you want. I believe there is work being done to add "slices" to .NET that are able to refer to ranges of memory in the way you want. The work is being done on Github in the corefxlab repo.</p>
