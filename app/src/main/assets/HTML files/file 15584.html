<li><p>Since you already include jQuery, use the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">ajax() function</a>. It has much better error handling and solves many corner cases for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Update to a more recent version of jQuery. <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery" rel="nofollow">The latest release is 1.7.2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>localhost</code> will only work if the server is on the same machine as the browser. OK during development but will break when you deploy. Either get rid of it (then the browser will prepend it for you) or make sure the URL is generated from the servlet context.</p></li>
