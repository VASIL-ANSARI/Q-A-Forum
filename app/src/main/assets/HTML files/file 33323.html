<p>If you mean you don't want the elements hidden behind the dropdown then you have two ways to go..</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Attach an onClick event to the dropdown to change the min-height css attribute of the box below (which contains the other elements) or the container of the select box from 'auto' to the needed amount of pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a dropdown in CSS with divs/ul showing and hiding the children elements. You can take the same approach as a website does dropdown menu in their headers. This will push all content down.</p></li>
</ol>
