<p>This seems like a horrible way to do things, you really should look into more appropriate frameworks, such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">SpriteKit</a>. </p>

<p>I am not a game developer myself, but using NSTimer seems like a bad idea, especially if performance is of any importance. In short, you should rethink the logic of when and how the screen is redrawn, instead of forcing a redraw every x ms, let the system handle deciding this for you, for example, if you were animating something using CoreAnimation, the system would be only redrawing parts of the screen etc.</p>

<p>In short, read up on game engines and potentially rethink your approach, good luck!</p>
