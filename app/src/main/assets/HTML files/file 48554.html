<p>I would suggest using Git and branches for this type of version management.</p>

<p>A master branch where you do all generic development which all apps will take advantage of.</p>

<p>A branch for each organisation. Whenever you make specific changes for an organisation, checkout their branch, merge master into it (to get up to date with generic changes) and then make the specific changes.</p>

<p>There are some great git guides via github: <a href="https://guides.github.com/" rel="nofollow">https://guides.github.com/</a></p>
