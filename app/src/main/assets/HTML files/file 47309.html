<p>Assuming your <code>INSERT</code> is for <code>Table2</code> then it should change from</p>

<pre><code>sql = "INSERT INTO [dbo].[DetailsList] VALUES "
        + "(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);";
</code></pre>

<p>to include the target database name. With something like (and you don't need the semi-colon in the query)</p>

<pre><code>sql = "INSERT INTO [OrganizationMaster].[dbo].[DetailsList] VALUES "
        + "(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
</code></pre>
