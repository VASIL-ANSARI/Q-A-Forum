<p>Looking into the library code, your assumption is wrong.</p>

<p>Font awesome doesn't work with images at all, it works with fonts. The <code>UIImageView</code> doesn't actually have an image set. It has a label inside and setting the icon makes the text in that label changed.</p>

<p>That's why your code doesn't work - <code>faImageView.image</code> is supposed to be empty.</p>

<p>Personally I think this is a very poor library design.</p>

<p>Instead of using the default <code>imageView</code> of the cell, a better solution is to just <code>[cell.contentView addSubview:faImageView]</code> and set its frame.</p>
