<p>The root cause of the problem is that Tkinter isn't designed to have two root windows. Doing so has some unexpected side effects such as what you're seeing. In effect, you can think of the two root windows as two separate processes or threads which cannot share information. Your <code>IntVar</code> belongs to the first window, but you're trying to use it in the second. </p>

<p>The fix is to never create more than one instance of <code>Tk</code>. If you need more windows, create instances of <code>Toplevel</code>. Doing that, you can share the same <code>IntVar</code> among as many windows as you want.</p>
