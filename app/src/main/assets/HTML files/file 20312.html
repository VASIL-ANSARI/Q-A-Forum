<p><strong>If your site is not huge in traffic, u put it all in the same table (user and settings).</strong>  This is the relevant answer for the OP.<br>
Usually, u separate 1:1 into different tables when several conditions happen (together):</p>

<ol>
<li>each group of fields is relevant to a different module in your app</li>
<li>each group of fields is access in different rates (username/password each login, billing settings once/twice in a week, for example)</li>
<li>There is huge traffic into your site, where u need to milk any ounch of performance from your system</li>
</ol>

<p>As u can see from above, most do not need to separate it.</p>
