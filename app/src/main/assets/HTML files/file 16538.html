<p>Move your "pages" folder to be under WebContent instead of WEB-INF. JSP pages shold be protected under WEB-INF but not static files like css, js, html.</p>

<p>The root of your application context is WebContent which would be referenced as </p>

<pre><code>http://server.com/contextroot/
</code></pre>

<p>Best practise would say to create a folder WebContent/css and place your file loginregister.css in there. Your link will then be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/loginregister.css" media="screen"&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>To test, you can simply enter the following URL in your browser to ensure that the css file is being served from your context root as expected</p>

<pre><code>http://server.com/contextroot/css/loginregister.css
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>For your initial testing, also place your login.html in WebContent (e.g. <code>WebContent/login.html</code>) as well, however you have mentioned you're using Spring so you'll probably end up replacing login.html with an equivalent JSP.</p>

<pre><code>http://server.com/contextroot/login.html
</code></pre>
