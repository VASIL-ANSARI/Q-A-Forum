<p>All printers will differ slightly in where they print something on a page because of slight variations in the feed mechanism, etc. What you need to do is find something on the page that you can recognise, after it's been scanned in, and use that to calibrate the software that knows where the bubbles are.</p>

<p>Ideally you want more than one artefact to use for calibration. For example, recognise the top left of the "Marking Instructions" box, and the bottom right of the parents/grandparents information at the bottom.</p>

<p>If you then know that a bubble is 70% of the horizontal distance between these two locations, and 30% of the vertical location, you can calculate exactly where on the scanned page it should be.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since you're on the printing side of the equation (as pointed out by +TaW, below), not the scanning side, the best thing you can do is add a '+' to each corner of the TIFF, outside the current printed area (but not outside the printable area, obviously), that whoever is doing the scanning side can identify and use for calibration as I've described above.</p>
