<p>Let's asume that the labels are named <code>textView1</code> and <code>textView2</code>.</p>

<p>What you need is to set a constraint for centering horizontally <code>textView1</code> to it's <code>superview</code>(the <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>), then center <code>textView2</code> with <code>textView1</code> (you can center to it's <code>superview</code> too) and you will have both centered.</p>

<p>For getting it on top of one another, you have to set a constraint for setting <code>textView2</code> top as the <code>textView1</code> bottom.</p>

<p>Never used Masonry, but looks like you need to have these constraints:</p>

<pre><code>[textView1 mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
    //Center first textView in the superview
    make.centerX.equalTo(superview); 
}];
[textView2 mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
    //Center second textView with the first one 
    make.centerX.equalTo(textView1);
    //Set second textView to be below the first one
    make.top.equalTo(textView1.mas_bottom);
}];
</code></pre>
