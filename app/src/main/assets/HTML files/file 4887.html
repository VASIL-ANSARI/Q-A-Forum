<p>Is this what you're looking for?</p>

<p>I think what you want to do is hook up ItemsSource to an <code>XmlDataProvider</code> (which you can also create in code), with its <code>XPath</code> set to <code>/root/resultset/data/row</code>. Then for each element you can use, say <code>Text = {Binding XPath=./field}</code>.</p>

<p>I'm a little iffy on the details since I haven't done this in a while, but hopefully that'll set you in the right direction.</p>
