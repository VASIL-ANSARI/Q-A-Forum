<p>The solution was to assign the task to a project in the first call directly. The confusion lies in the parameters for creating a task. We expected that <code>project</code> should be a single integer, but it is <code>projects</code> and an array with one or more projects is expected over there. </p>

<p>The project was assigned to the given user, but was private. So using <code>addProject</code> in a separate call after the task was created did result into an authorization error.</p>
