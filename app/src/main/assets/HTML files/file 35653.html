<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd742857%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ID2D1RenderTarget::SetTransform</code></a> can be used to implement a 2D camera.  All drawing operations will first apply the transform, which is a 3x2 matrix and therefore fully capable of representing a camera with translation, rotation, scale, and skew (though you probably shouldn't let your camera skew the scene).  As for how to generate the matrix, look at the helper functions in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd372275%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>D2D1::Matrix3x2F</code></a> class and check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff684172%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a> on applying transforms.</p>

<p>As for an actual look-at camera, if you want to have look-at coordinate <em>c</em> in the center of a target of size <em>s</em>, you would set the translation to (<em>s</em> / 2) - <em>c</em>.</p>
