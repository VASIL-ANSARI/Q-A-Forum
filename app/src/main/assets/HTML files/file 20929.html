<p>Yes, looks like SL to me. Dependency injection traditionally follows one of two patterns; property injection or constructor injection. </p>

<p>Dependency injection feels more effort than service location at first, but service location (SL) has a number of negatives. It is far too easy with a service locator to just go crazy requesting services on a whim, all over the place. This is fine until you go to refactor and realise the coupling is "too damn high". </p>

<p>With DI I prefer the constructor injection form because it forces me to think up front about who needs what.</p>

<p>That all said, my current project was started as a green field project using a service locator because it gave me the flexibility "not" to think about dependencies and to let the application shape evolve. Latterly I've been refactoring to use DI, mainly to get a handle on what relies on what and why.</p>
