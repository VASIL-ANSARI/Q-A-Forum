<p>String literals are immutable. You are not allowed to attempt to modify them.</p>

<pre><code>char* a = "aaaa";         // deprecated!
*a = 'b';                 // unsafe &amp; undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Your compiler <em>should</em> be warning you that, actually, your code should read:</p>

<pre><code>const char* a = "aaaa";   // OK
*a = 'b';                 // can't compile
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>const</code> prevents it from even compiling.</p>

<p><strike>I notice that the problem in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/20728649/560648">your previous question</a> was <em>also</em> caused by not heeding warnings (and/or having them switched off). <strong>Read your compiler's warnings.</strong></strike></p>

<p>It looks like Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 doesn't emit any warning, though, which is <em>really</em> sad.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to copy the string literal's contents into a local copy:</p>

<pre><code>char a[] = "aaaa";        // OK: a copy
*a = 'b';                 // OK
</code></pre>
