<p>First thing, I highly suggest using a pattern instead of concatenating your strings using plus sign. This will help you see things more clear:</p>

<pre><code>string pattern = string.Format("{0}\t\t{1}\t\t{2}\t\t{3}\t\tAnnualSalary: {4}, Annual Bonus: {5}", 
emp[index].first, 
emp[index].last, 
emp[index].number,
emp[index].department, 
emp[index].annualSalary).ToString("c"),
emp[index].annualBonus);
</code></pre>

<p>The answer to your question is that you are using tabs assuming they will fill the space for you, but they won't. You need to use advanced features of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>string.Format or  string.Pad</p>
</blockquote>
