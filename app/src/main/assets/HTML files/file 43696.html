<p>All your drawing methods end with <code>g.dispose()</code>, but when you do this, the next drawing method is completely out of luck since you've effectively <em>obliterated</em> the Graphics object, and so they have nothing to draw with.</p>

<p>Solution: Don't keep disposing your Graphics object.</p>

<p>Some general rules</p>

<ul>
<li>Never dispose a Graphics object given to you by the JVM.</li>
<li>Do dispose of Graphics objects that <strong>you</strong> create when done using them, but only when completely done. You're disposing them at the end of each method, completely wiping it out for the next method. Here you should only call dispose once, on g2 and at the end of the paintComponent method.</li>
<li>You should dispose of the created g2 variable <strong>once</strong> at the end of the <code>paintComponent</code> method. </li>
</ul>

<p>For that matter, I"m not sure that you need to make a copy of the Graphics object, and if you don't copy it via the create() method, then you should not dispose of it at all.</p>
