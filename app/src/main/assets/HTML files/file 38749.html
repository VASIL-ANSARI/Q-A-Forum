<p>What's happening is column Cierre is a string format, such as varchar or nvarcher. When updating BaseHistorica_ you're trying to convert cierre to datetime2 and store it in column Cierre, which is a string. You'll have to figure out the format of the strings in Cierre and conform to that standard.</p>

<p>There's a problem with saving your dates as varchars though.  One is that anyone else can input a date in a different format.  For instance, '01/08/2014' and you input the date as '01-08-2014'. They're totally different values because they're strings, not dates.  The best thing to do is to have your date columns formatted as dates, in your case datetime2, and then format the dates when you're querying the data. When your values are dates then you can use various SQL functions such as date ranges (BETWEEN '01/01/2012' AND '01/01/2013') and DATEDIFF.   So the rule of thumb is to store as date and only format the output.</p>
