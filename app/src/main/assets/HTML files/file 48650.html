  <p>But I don't see any mail in my inbox. In the terminal the email is
  printed, which contains the activation link.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's because you have defined <code>EMAIL_BACKEND</code> in you settings. You have to remove or comment this line if you want to receive email to your inbox.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, when I goto the activation link, it says your account is
  activated. Now I am able to logout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's because you set <code>REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN</code> to True. After activating the user there is a method <code>login_user</code> which will be called. In that method is a "hack for to bypassing authenticate()" which means that this method can log you in without knowing the password.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I tried logging in, before logging out as well as after logging
  out. Both time I failed to log in. It says Please enter a correct
  username and password.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually you have never defined your password. If there is no password field in your registration form, django will automatically create some random password during to process of creating a new user.</p>

  <p>These are my settings. I tried in both modes - DEBUG = True and DEBUG
  = False.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DEBUG has nothing with your problem</p>
