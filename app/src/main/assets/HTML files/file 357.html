<p>Check the Debug tab on your project's properties page. There should be an "Enable unmanaged code debugging" checkbox. This worked for me when we developed a new .NET UI for  our old c++ DLLs.</p>

<p>If your unmanaged DLL is being built from another project (for a while ours were being built using VS6) just make sure you have the DLL's pdb file handy for the debugging.</p>

<p>The other approach is to use the C# exe as the target exe to run from the DLL project, you can then debug your DLL normally.</p>
