<p>Go <a href="http://www.xmlvalidation.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> to check your XML. </p>

<p>The first error would be the part where it says:</p>

<pre><code>vti_etag:SW|"{6815B6B4-1BB2-49D5-8326-3FFCE74A5E1A},7"
</code></pre>

<p>since that would not mix well with your other attribute values that are quoted as well.</p>

<p>If you truly don't have control over the string response, you'd best perform manipulation on the string to fix it before you load it to XmlDocument.</p>
