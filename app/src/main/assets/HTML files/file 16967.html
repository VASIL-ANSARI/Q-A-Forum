<p>For those hitting the same problem: I have not found a solution. I have however successfully connected an app to the Google API and can access all the info and methods I want.</p>

<p>Decided to go about this with <code>omniauth</code>. It's really simple, there's a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth" rel="nofollow">railscast episode</a> on how omniauth works, and a great walk through of using omniauth to connect to Google <a href="http://gregandrachel.baugues.com/google-calendar-api-oauth2-and-ruby-on-rails" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It describes specifically the act of connecting to the Google Calendar, but all you would need to do is change the <code>client.discovered_api</code> setter and the <code>client.execute</code> call in the sessions_controller to which ever you want. Decent documentation and code examples at developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/</p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>
