<p>After fighting with this problem for a while I found the problem was I was making the call to /oauth2/token using Advanced Rest Client from a browser I was already logged into Twitter with. After logging out of Twitter and making the API call again it worked fine. </p>

<p>Short answer: make sure you do not already have an active session logged into Twitter when attempting to request a Bearer token.</p>
