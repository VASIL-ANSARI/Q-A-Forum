<p>Seems like you're using two directives with a isolate scope (<code>scope: {...}</code>) not just in the same view but on the same element. your element probably looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p mw-confirm-click="..." translate="..." ...&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you either have to remove one of the directives with the isolate scope (<code>mw-confirm-click</code> or the <code>translate</code> directive) or you have to remove the isolate scope from your directive and use the variables from the parent scope...</p>
