<p>If you want iteration on a String instance to iterate on its <code>self.__string</code>, as your <code>__iter__</code> method indicates, the only sensible choice for length is also to return the length of <code>__string</code> -- it would be <em>truly</em> peculiar if <code>len(x)</code> and <code>sum(1 for _ in x)</code> resulted in different values.</p>

<p>I have to admit I don't understand the purpose of this class (and in particular why you made the terrible choice of having it old-style, and why you use such a contorted way to build <code>__simple</code>), but internal consistency is important anyway.  So, either change <code>__iter__</code>, or make <code>__len__</code> logically compatible with it.</p>

<p>Your slicing logic also totally escapes me -- why are you building the slice's <code>__simple</code> in a way that's likely to be different from what you'd get by rebuilding it from the slice's <code>__string</code>? E.g., if <code>self.__string</code> is '?Boh!' and therefore <code>self.__simple</code> is 'boh', why would you <strong>want</strong> <code>self[1:-1]</code> to have a <code>__string</code> of 'Boh' but with a <code>__simple</code> of 'o', so incompatible, different, and inconsistent from the <code>__simple</code> you'd get by recomputing it from the slice...?</p>

<p>I guess that's not germane to this Q about length, but I'm just curious about these many, extremely peculiar design choices that you're making...</p>
