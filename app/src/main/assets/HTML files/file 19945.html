<p>Since this has been viewed a few times, I figured I ought to post how I ended up getting this working. I basically go through the database and see if every point is inside some selection area I picked based on testing:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean withinSelectionArea(GeoPoint myPointG, GeoPoint dbPointG, Context context) {
    Point myPoint = projection.toPixels(myPointG, null);
    Point dbPoint = projection.toPixels(dbPointG, null);
    float a = dbPoint.x - myPoint.x;
    float b = dbPoint.y - myPoint.y;
    double distance = Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b);
    return distance &lt; context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().densityDpi / 4;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also overrode the onLongPress handler and called the above method in that.</p>
