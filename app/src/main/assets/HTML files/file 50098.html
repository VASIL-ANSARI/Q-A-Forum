<p>4294967295 is <code>0xffffffff</code> that is a 32 bits word with all one bits. On most machines, that is also <code>(unsigned)-1</code> which is the usual <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/npos" rel="nofollow">str::npos</a> constant.</p>

<p>BTW, did you try using <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow">GCC</a> to compile your code with <code>g++ -Wall -g</code>? Then use <code>gdb</code> for debugging. </p>
