<p>You could do something like find the exact time it is at a point in time and then keep it in a while loop which rechecks the time until it gets to whatever the time you want. Then it just breaks out and continue executing the rest of your program.  I'm not sure if I see much of a benefit in looping rather than just using the delay function though.</p>
