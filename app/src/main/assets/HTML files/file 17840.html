<p>In the <code>MethodTarget</code> class there is a method called <code>getRemainingBuffer()</code>, which returns the content of the current line entered in the console. An object of this type is one of the arguments of the <code>getAllPossibleValues</code> method which needs to be implemented in a converter, which is needed for custom types of commands.</p>

<p>That seems to be it.</p>
