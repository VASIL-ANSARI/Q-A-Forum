<p>Those results probably address the same problem you're having.  This is the relevant part of the games.py file from livewires, and nowhere does it call <code>pygame.quit()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def handle_events (self):
    """
    If you override this method in a subclass of the Screen
    class, you can specify how to handle different kinds of
    events.  However you must handle the quit condition!
    """
    events = pygame.event.get ()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == QUIT:
            self.quit ()
        elif event.type == KEYDOWN:
            self.keypress (event.key)
        elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            self.mouse_up (event.pos, event.button-1)
        elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            self.mouse_down (event.pos, event.button-1)

def quit (self):
    """
    Calling this method will stop the main loop from running and
    make the graphics window disappear.
    """

    self._exit = 1

def mainloop (self, fps = 50):
    """
    Run the pygame main loop. This will animate the objects on the
    screen and call their tick methods every tick.

    fps -- target frame rate
    """

    self._exit = 0

    while not self._exit:
        self._wait_frame (fps)

        for object in self._objects:
            if not object._static:
                object._erase ()
                object._dirty = 1

        # Take a copy of the _objects list as it may get changed in place.
        for object in self._objects [:]:
            if object._tickable: object._tick ()

        self.tick ()

        if Screen.got_statics:
            for object in self._objects:
                if not object._static:
                    for o in object.overlapping_objects ():
                        if o._static and not o._dirty:
                            o._erase ()
                            o._dirty = 1

        for object in self._objects:
            if object._dirty:
                object._draw ()
                object._dirty = 0

        self._update_display()

        self.handle_events()

    # Throw away any pending events.
    pygame.event.get()
</code></pre>

<p>The QUIT event just sets a flag which drops you out of the while loop in the <code>mainloop</code> function.  I'm guessing that if you find this file in your Python directory and stick a <code>pygame.quit()</code> after the last line in <code>mainloop</code>, it will solve your problem.</p>
