<ol>
<li>You shouldn't use Thread.Abort()</li>
<li>Tasks can be Cancelled but not aborted. </li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ty8d3wta.aspx">Thread.Abort()</a> method is (severely) deprecated.</p>

<p>Both Threads and Tasks should cooperate when being stopped, otherwise you run the risk of leaving the system in a unstable/undefined state. </p>

<p>If you do need to run a Process and kill it from the outside, the only safe option is to run it in a separate AppDomain.</p>
