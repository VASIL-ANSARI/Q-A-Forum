<p>There's no way to "send the structure" in such a way that you won't have to do any unpacking in your server. The struct definition only makes sense to the C++ server, and even there the way it's mapped into memory isn't guaranteed. You're going to need some sort of serialization (translating program data into a parse-able data stream for storage or transport), and text formats like XML and JSON are a simple and reliable way of doing it. I would go with JSON since it's supported natively by Javascript; all you have to do is add properties to an object and then <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify" rel="nofollow">JSON.stringify</a> it. The real work is on the server side. There, you would need to use a library such as <a href="http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JsonCpp</a> or <a href="http://fossil.wanderinghorse.net/repos/nosjob/index.cgi/index" rel="nofollow">nosjob</a> to read the JSON data. Then you can store each value in your struct manually.</p>
