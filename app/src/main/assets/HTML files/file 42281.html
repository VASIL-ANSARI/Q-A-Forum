<p>Okay so turns out that my verion of gcc (or the linux kernel or whatever software component I was using) automatically creates the key file at ftok (note that "key" did not exist on my system). The college server however did not. So </p>

<pre><code>key_t key = ftok("argv[0]", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>key_t key = ftok("filename", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>does the trick.</p>
