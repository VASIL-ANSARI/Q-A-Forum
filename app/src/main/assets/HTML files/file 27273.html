<p>The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it.</p>

<p>Also, <code>display:table-cell</code> makes the element behave like the  HTML tag.
The <code>vertical-align:top</code> propriety makes the element aligned to the top of the entire line or align the top padding edge of the cell with the top of the row. So the </p>

<p><code>.float {
display: table-cell;
vertical-align: top;
}</code></p>

<p>looks like if it had <code>float:left</code> only.</p>

<p>I hope this will help you understand CSS better.</p>
