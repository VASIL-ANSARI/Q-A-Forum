<p>Remember that a probability distribution has to be monotonically non-decreasing over its entire run, which your example is not. Even worse, that small dip is not due to user error -- their points are increasing as required -- but is an artifact of the interpolation method. If you use linear interpolation, then any non-monotonicity is your user's fault, and you can warn them. </p>
