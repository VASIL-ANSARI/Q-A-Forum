<ol>
<li>Fill up an array with your range of values</li>
<li>Shuffle the array</li>
<li>Pick the first 5 elements</li>
</ol>

<p>If the range is very large, and the number of values you want is pretty small (like, 5 distinct values in the range 1 ... 1000000) then you can try generating random numbers in the range and throw away (unlikely) duplicates until you have 5. The problem with the "keep trying" approach is that there's a teeny tiny chance you could spend a lot of time with a string of random values that give you a lot of duplicates. For a big range of values, that's so unlikely that it's probably worth risking it unless the software is giving oxygen to trauma patients or something.</p>
