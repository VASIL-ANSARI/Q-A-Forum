<p>a thorough reading of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3506208/jquery-ajax-cross-domain">JQuery ajax cross domain</a> seems to indicate that the server you are querying is returning a header string that prohibits cross-domain json requests.  Check the headers of the response you are receiving to see if the  Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set, and whether its value restricts cross-domain requests to the local host.</p>
