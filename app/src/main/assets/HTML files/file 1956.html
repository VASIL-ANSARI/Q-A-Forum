<p>Services don't have a desktop associated with them, so when you start the GUI application, it will not show up to the user.</p>

<p>You need to configure the service to have interaction with the desktop, then it will work. You can do this either diagrammatically in the service installer class</p>

<p>Or manually in the service properties windows, under the <em>Log On</em> tab.</p>
