<p>I understand someone is working on adding width and other options to App Designer for cases like this, but unfortunately it's not out yet.  In the meantime, you can try to construct a very specific CSS rule so that it might be higher priority than whatever rule is currently setting it's width. It might also help to set both width and max-width.  Adding <code>!important</code> if necessary, though no one likes to use that if they can avoid it.</p>
