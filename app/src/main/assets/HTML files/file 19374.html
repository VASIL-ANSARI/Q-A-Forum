<p>Creating a new unique key on the over columns you need to have as uniques will automatically clean the table of any duplicates.</p>

<pre><code>ALTER IGNORE TABLE `table_name`
    ADD UNIQUE KEY `key_name`(`column_1`,`column_2`);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>IGNORE</strong> part does not allow the script to terminate after the first error occurs. And the default behavior is to delete the duplicates.</p>
