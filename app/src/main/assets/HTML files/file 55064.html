<p>The easiest way would be to 'append' a new column to the table via the SQL statement and sort by it. The best thing for that would be a GUID(). In MySQL it should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT msg FROM msgs WHERE topic='$topic' ORDER BY newid()
SELECT msg FROM msgs WHERE topic='$topic' ORDER BY newid()
</code></pre>
