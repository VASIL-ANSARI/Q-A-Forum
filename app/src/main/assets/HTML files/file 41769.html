<p>You cannot get the ith entry from a dictionary. A dictionary is not a list nor an array, it is a dictionary. The items are stored in a hash (not neccessarily in order). Imagine if you took a list of items then removed all the links to the previous and next item, then hashing those items. That is kind've what a dictionary is.</p>
