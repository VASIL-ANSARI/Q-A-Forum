<p>This cannot be done. For meteor to get live updates you need a connection to a server of some sort to relay the message down.</p>

<p>There are a couple of methods you could use, however</p>

<p>If you like the DOM reactivity and all the data is locally hosted/you would like to fetch it from php would like to use it in a static application something like <a href="http://angularjs.org/" rel="nofollow">angular</a> or <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" rel="nofollow">react</a> could help you.</p>

<p>The other is you could use a deployed instance of an application &amp; have it stored on a static/varnish server. But use DDP to have the server relay data.
