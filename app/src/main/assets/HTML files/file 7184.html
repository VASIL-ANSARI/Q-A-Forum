<p>Unless all nodes share some common knowledge, I think your solution would have to rely on IP broadcast. Broadcasting is defined as sending a packet to all network nodes on a subnet, so if your master node does that while all worker nodes listen for it, you should be able to connect them all without knowing the IP addresses a priori.</p>

<p>I haven't coded this in Scala, but here's a fairly readable example of how to broadcast messages in java: <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/datagrams/broadcasting.html" rel="nofollow">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/datagrams/broadcasting.html</a>. It should be straightforward to adapt it to Scala using the same classes.</p>
