<p>I think the whole page is wrapped in a div which have a 100% height and 100% width. So you have a control over everything inside that element.</p>

<p>You can achieve that by using css3 <code>transform: scale(value);</code> and of course <code>jQuery</code></p>

<p>see samples <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/examples/l/bl-css-transformation-examples.htm#scale" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
