<p>Your email generation code generates a URL with the query string parameters <code>leavetrnumber</code> and <code>UserID</code>. But your query string parameters for your <code>SqlDataSource</code> is looking for <code>LtrNo</code> and <code>LeaveStatus</code>. You probably need those to match for your <code>SqlDataSource</code> to retrieve the results. Grabbing the values in the <code>Page_Load</code> function doesn't automatically pass them into parameters in your data source.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking at your updated question, you have two options. You can get the query string to match like I described above. Or you can make sure you rebind the GridView after assigning the values to the parameters. Ex: </p>

<pre><code>var LTRno = Request.QueryString["leavetrnumber"]
LeaveApprovalSD1.SelectParameters["LeaveTRNumber"].DefaultValue = LTRno;
LeaveDate.DataBind();
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like this approach, because the whole point of using a QueryStringParameter in your SqlDataSource is that you shouldn't need to have code wire up the parameters. You should just make the parameters match.</p>

<p>One other thing to fix is that your URL in the email generation code needs to point to the server. Localhost is the loopback address 127.0.0.1, and will always go to the local machine. You need to provide the dns name of the server (perhaps the host name, or you may have an alias set up).</p>
