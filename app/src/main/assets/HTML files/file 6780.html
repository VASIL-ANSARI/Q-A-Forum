<p>I'm sorry, but that's exactly what you're looking to do. It is not possible to detect screen readers unless they expose themselves to content scripts in some way, and there are many different screen readers, so you shouldn't really try. If anything, you might be able to get some hack working in browsers that support aural CSS to detect screen readers, but you're definitely not going to be able to detect if a certain ARIA feature is supported or not.</p>

<p>No browsers actually "support" ARIA more than just providing element property accessors in the DOM; only screen readers/assistive reading software supports ARIA, in that it actually uses the ARIA attributes to help the user interact with a website.</p>
