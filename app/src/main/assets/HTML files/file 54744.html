<p>I found a solution. If I change the HTTP request fron asyncron to syncron then I can setup the route click by click correctly. If you are interested in the code (auto routing/direction with multiple, multiple, .. Waypoints) replace the http function from above with the attached http function. </p>

<p>If someone can improve the Http function with some error checking(regarding the comments from W3school), it would be fine.</p>

<p>best regards, Reinhard</p>

	//Notes from:http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_xmlhttprequest_send.asp
	//Using async=false is not recommended, but for a few small requests this can be ok.
	//Remember that the JavaScript will NOT continue to execute, until the server response is ready.
	//If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop.
	//Note: When you use async=false, do NOT write an onreadystatechange function -
	// just put the code after the send() statement:
