<p>From the man page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opening a FIFO for reading normally
  blocks until some other process opens
  the same FIFO for writing, and vice
  versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A process can open a FIFO in
  non-blocking mode. In this case,
  opening for read only will succeed
  even if no-one has opened on the write
  side yet; opening for write only will
  fail with ENXIO (no such device or
  address) unless the other end has
  already been opened.</p>
  
  <p>Under Linux, opening a FIFO for read
  and write will succeed both in
  blocking and non-blocking mode. POSIX
  leaves this behaviour undefined. This
  can be used to open a FIFO for writing
  while there are no readers available.
  A process that uses both ends of the
  connection in order to communicate
  with itself should be very careful to
  avoid deadlocks.</p>
