<p>If you are comparing Strings, don't use <code>==</code>, but use <code>equals()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if(Gender.equals( "boy" ) ){
  System.out.println("You are cool.");
}
if(Gender.equals( "girl" ) ){
  System.out.println("You are cute.");
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Java <code>==</code> compares object identities and not contents! So in your case your compare the object, you read in, with two others objects. This will always fail.</p>

<p>On the other hand <code>equals()</code> compares the contents of both objects and thus will succeed here.</p>
