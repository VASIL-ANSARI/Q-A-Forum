<p>rapidjson is a header only library, you should be able to just grab the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/" rel="nofollow">rapidjson git repository</a> and place the files in your project/system's include path.</p>

<p>Note that this repository is in active development and I don't see any official stable releases yet, so you may also want to check out <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/wiki/UserGuide" rel="nofollow">its old home at google code</a>. This is discussed in this <a href="https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/issues/54" rel="nofollow">issue on the github repo</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about updating the libraries that come with Xcode specifically. You should be fine with just adding the rapidjson header files somewhere on your machine - either with the rest of your include files or in a directory which you <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html" rel="nofollow">specify to GCC as being an include directory</a> using the <code>-I(include directory here)</code> command line option. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code>-I"external/includes"</code> if you place the rapidjson files in the relative directory <code>external/includes/rapidjson</code> and use <code>#include &lt;rapidjson/(rapidjson file name)&gt;</code> when including a rapidjson file. </p>

<p>If you do either of those <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html" rel="nofollow">GCC will look there before looking in the system include paths</a> (where XCode most likely installed rapidjson), and use the newer files you provided. I don't have any personal experience with LLVM, but I'd assume they would handle include files the same way (though the command line option may be different).</p>
