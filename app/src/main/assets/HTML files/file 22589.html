<p><code>_OgreExport</code> is a preprocessor directive that expands to either</p>

<pre><code>__declspec(dllimport)
</code></pre>

<p>when the file is included outside its module or</p>

<pre><code>__declspec(dllexport)
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise. Under Windows, you have to specify which classes/methods you want exported/imported so that they can be used across binaries.</p>

<p>Technically, as James pointed out in the comments, the macro name is illegal, since it begins with an underscore. These names are reserved for the implementation.</p>
