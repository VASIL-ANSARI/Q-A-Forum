<p>Configure the connection string with autoReconnect=true. This is a property of the URL connection string, which works at the driver level. You need to change the connection string in the data source configuration. The URL below is used in case of mysql. Postgres must be having some way to do this.</p>

<pre><code>url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourDB?autoReconnect=true"
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can increase timeout in postgres configuration files.</p>
