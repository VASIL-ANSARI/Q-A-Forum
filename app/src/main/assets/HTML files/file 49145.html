<p>When you make a signal connection (<code>btnX.clicked.connect()</code>) this does not automatically disconnect the previously connected slot. As such, as you progress through your game, each button click is actually executing every method that has been connected to it, which starts getting slower and slower as more and more methods are connected to the clicked signal of each button.</p>

<p>You need to call <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/new_style_signals_slots.html#disconnect" rel="nofollow"><code>btnX.clicked.disconnect(previous_slot)</code></a> before making the new connection with <code>btnX.clicked.connect(new_slot)</code>.</p>

<p>This requires you to know which slot was previously connected (as you need to refer to the method name) when you come to connect the next method. I haven't followed through the logic of your program to see how easy that is, but it is what you need to do. Otherwise you will need to take a different approach that doesn't require changing the slot the button is connected to (for example using a stacked widget to switch between different sets of buttons, or similar)</p>
