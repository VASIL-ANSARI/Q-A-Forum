<p>Can you please show the desired output? That will help.</p>

<p>I tried to comprehend your query and came up with this - </p>

<pre><code>select distinct * from 
(
select user_id, min(work_date) over (partition by user_id) start_date, max(work_date) over (partition by user_id) end_date  
from test_seq t
where not exists (select null from temp_holidys h
                         where h.holiday=t.work_date)
)
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks, Aditya</p>
