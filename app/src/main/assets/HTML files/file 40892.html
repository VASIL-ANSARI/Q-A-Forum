<p>Well, I believe there is a misunderstanding here, since when I select a project in the startup window (IntelliJ v14) and hit <em>delete</em>, it prompts me:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EXgT2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>This tells me that you are not actually deleting the project, you are just deleting it from the recent projects list.</p>

<p>I suggest you close the project and delete the project folder from your file system manually to be sure the delete is done fully and cleanly.</p>
