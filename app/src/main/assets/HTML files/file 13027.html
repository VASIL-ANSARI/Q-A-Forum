<p><strong>Don't do this</strong> -- unless <em>the value is a single "opaque" external data-type</em>, such as a Enum of flags -- <strong>if the columns will <em>ever</em> be used in a query or will <em>ever</em> be used outside of said "opaque" type: use discrete/separate fields.</strong> (Of the correct type, as jmucchiello and MarkR noted in their answers.)</p>

<p>Trying "for performance" here will just make you loath databases -- and this one in particular -- when you have to "fix" it or work around the ugly scheme later. (If you have a performance problem you'll know it ... <em>and</em> know enough to run a <em>performance analysis</em> before asking.) Donald Knuth was right when he pointed out that 97% of stuff Just Doesn't Matter. So make it pretty and let the database do what it feels like doing.</p>

<p>Happy coding.</p>
