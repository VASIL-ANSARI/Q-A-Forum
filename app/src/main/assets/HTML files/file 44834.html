<p>I found my mistake. ng-include creates a new scope. And because i had <code>navCollapsed = !navCollapsed</code> in the template, angular created a new navCollapsed in this childscope. so changes in the navigation-Controller won't have any effect. I Solved the problem by calling a function <code>toggleNavCollapsed()</code>which is defined in navigation-Controller</p>
