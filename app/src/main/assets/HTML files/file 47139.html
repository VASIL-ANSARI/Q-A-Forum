<p>The documentation may be unclear on that, but <code>angular.injector</code> indeed initiates the whole module with <code>config</code> and <code>run</code> blocks (otherwise you would run across the issues with app components that depend on these blocks). </p>

<p>The instances of module services (including <code>$rootScope</code>) also won't be the same as the ones within bootstrapped app.</p>

<p>You are free to divide the module the way its services would be easy to use, but keep in mind that you won't be able to interact with running Angular app. If you need to use the same code inside and outside Angular, then define it outside.</p>

<p>If you need to interact with running app instead, then do</p>

<pre><code>var injector = angular.element(document).injector();
</code></pre>

<p>instead, as the documentation <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.injector#example" rel="nofollow">suggests</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm also a bit concerned calling the injector a lot is bad for
  performance?</p>

<p>Sure, there would be some RAM and CPU overhead , its severity totally depends on your module.</p>
