<p>The configuration in the <em>php.ini</em> is used for the whole server while the configuration in a <em>.htaccess</em> file is only used when a request goes to the directory or subdirectory the <em>.htaccess</em> file is located in.</p>

<p>So you can have a global or default configuration in your <em>php.ini</em> and specific configurations for individual directories in <em>.htaccess</em> files. Furthermore web hosting provider often do not allow access to the <em>php.ini</em> or server configuration but do only allow <em>.htaccess</em> files.</p>

<p>But notice the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php">configuration modes</a> every PHP configuration is bound to.</p>
