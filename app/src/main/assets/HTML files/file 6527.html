<p>I figured it out.  From looking at <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/909/4164.aspx">this</a> [really old] thread on the phxsoftware site, it seems like there can be locking problems if you don't immediately dispose of readers and commands after executing them.</p>

<p>I fixed my problem by making sure to not keep commands or readers around and surrounding them with using statements.</p>
