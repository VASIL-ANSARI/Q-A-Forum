<p>Most probably Web Api is looking for a Parse action that supports HttpPost <strong>and has object parameter.</strong> Because you post object, but not a string, that is why you get 404. </p>

<p>To solve this problem try to send :</p>

<p>$http.post(baseUrl + 'import/parse', 'test').success( ... );</p>
