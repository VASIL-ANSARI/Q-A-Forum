<p>Check the credentials in web.config. 
I would also change the connection string getter for something like</p>

<pre><code>WebConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, remember to include it in a "using" block or try/finally, where you can safely close&amp;dispose your connection and related objects.</p>
