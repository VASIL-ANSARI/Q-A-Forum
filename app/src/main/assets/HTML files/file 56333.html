<p>For large XML files I would say that your best shot is to use the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php" rel="nofollow">SAX XML Parser</a>.</p>

<p>It is a little complicated to manage if you compare it to SimpleXML, DOM parser or XMLReader but in terms of memory management I would say is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Then, for your queries I would go for XPath and you can find nice clues here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1863250/is-there-any-xpath-processor-for-sax-model">Is there any XPath processor for SAX model?</a></p>
