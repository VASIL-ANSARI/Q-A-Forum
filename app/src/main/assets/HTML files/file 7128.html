<p>Groovy scripts are interpreted within the JVM. This gives us the ability to dynamically modify the behavior of a program at runtime. <em>Runtime configurability</em> is an important feature in many types of applications. For example, in web applications and business process driven applications, conditional flows or branching can often be changed at runtime. Using <em>Groovy</em>, all you need is to change the script and make it available in some standard location from which the application can pick it up and execute. </p>

<p>There are a few other scripting languages available out there, but Groovy has the added advantage that it can interact very well with the available java objects and libraries making it a good fit within Java applications.</p>
