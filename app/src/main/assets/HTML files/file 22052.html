<p>Change this:</p>

<pre><code>@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet NSString *WrongLetter;
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *WrongLetter;
</code></pre>

<p>The WrongLetter property gets released too soon. And on second iteration it's just null.

It's a bad practice to name your variables with first letter capitalized. Usually class names get first letter capital.</p>
