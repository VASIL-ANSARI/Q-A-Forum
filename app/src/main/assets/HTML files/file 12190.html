<p>Here is some feedback:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not that normal to have a lot of whitespace after property names. Maybe it's a copy/paste problem.</li>
<li>Objects as shown by the {} are not arrays, FYI. SO you might not wants to call them arrays. You can make an array literal by using [], if that's what you want.</li>
<li>document.getElementById( 'someID' ); should NOT have a semi-colon at the end. That's your biggest mistake. </li>
<li>You sometimes use comma-before syntax and sometimes use comma-after. You could probably just stick with one. Personally, most of my JS is in node and comma-before is pretty normal there. Either works though. <a href="http://css-tricks.com/7741-commas-before/" rel="nofollow">http://css-tricks.com/7741-commas-before/</a></li>
<li>I put this in my code example, but didn't mention it up here. Braces should always be on the line with the parent. This is because of automatic semi-colon insertion, which can screw you up if you put a return on the line before {}.

Thanks Michael for mentioning it below!</li>

<p>Here's what I'd go with. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/n87Cn/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/n87Cn/</a> JSLINT doens't like it, but I think it's quite nice.</p>
