<p>Its a bit of a hack, but you could set the calendar's view.frame.origin.y to a negative value to offset the system's offset. </p>

<p>@property(nonatomic) CGPoint centerOffset</p>

<p>Discussion
By default, the center point of an annotation view is placed at the coordinate point of the associated annotation. You can use this property to reposition the annotation view as needed. This x and y offset values are measured in pixels. Positive offset values move the annotation view down and to the right, while negative values move it up and to the left.</p>
