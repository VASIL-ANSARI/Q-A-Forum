<p>There are two regular expressions.  The first is just <code>/xyz/</code>, which is used to test whether the function (coerced to a string) matches <code>xyz</code>.  It does.  Then, one of two regexen are returned (in this case the first because the test passes).</p>

<p>The first of them is word boundary followed by <code>_super</code> followed by another word boundary which can match at least <code>"_super"</code>, <code>" _super "</code>  and <code>word._super</code>.</p>

<p>The second matches zero or more characters (i.e. everything).</p>
