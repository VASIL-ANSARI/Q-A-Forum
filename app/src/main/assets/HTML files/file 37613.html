<p>Make sure you have the lucene core jar file included and its version is 4.9. If you've just moved from an older version to 4.9, probably you are using the wrong version of the lucene jars on the <strong>runtime environment</strong>. </p>

<p>I mean you are using the correct jars on eclipse, but the runtime configuration is pointing to another jar whose version is older than 4.9.</p>
