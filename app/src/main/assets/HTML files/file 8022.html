<p>Your HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="/images/int_kit_a_set.jpg" class="upload"&gt;&lt;img src="/Assets/images/int_kit_a_set_thumb.jpg"  ondragstart="return false" height="108" width="144" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript w/jQuery: </p>

<pre><code>var image = $("&lt;img /&gt;").attr("src", $(".upload").attr("href"));
$(document).append(image);
alert(image.height());
alert(image.width());
image.remove();
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't test the javascript... but I'm not really sure your question is clear... so maybe this is what you wanted, maybe not. </p>

<p>Essentially, I'm grabbing the HREF attribute of the link, creating a new image on the page with that url, measuring the image, and then removing it from the DOM. </p>

<p>You could add a style to the image which placed it off screen or something... but you'd have to mess with it to find something that worked cross-browser. Some browsers don't consistently load images which aren't visible. I'm also not sure if you'd run into any timing issues with my script.</p>
