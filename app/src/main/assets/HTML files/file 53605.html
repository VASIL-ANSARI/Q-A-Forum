<p>A long time ago I tried to do something similar to this.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there is no way to do it. You won't be able to simply change the values of the encrypted button and if it isn't encrypted, the user can change it and basically pay anything.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to safely and dynamically change values, I would suggest looking into their API/Express Checkout. That's what I did, and I am really glad that I did. </p>

<p>You can check everything before it is forwarded to PayPal, and I have never had an issue with that aspect of it (I pass the item ID  and query my database to get the cost/etc and apply other checks to stop various issues.). And you can go through and apply any calculations that you need to for the price without an issue.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the only way I could think of is having multiple encrypted buttons for different prices. But that isn't very fun nor an optimal solution.</p>

<p>Edit: Now that I am not on mobile, here is a link to the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/express-checkout/gs_expresscheckout/" rel="nofollow">Express Checkout Getting Started Guide.</a></p>

<p>Also, I do not believe that you need to worry about your Merchant ID being seen. It is used to process payments and I believe it can be seen in the transaction details.</p>
