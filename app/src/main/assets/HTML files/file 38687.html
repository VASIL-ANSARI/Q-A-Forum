<p>First, Grails is used to create web based applications, so you will need a controller that will respond to your browser request.</p>

<p>Secondly, if your controller is in a different package than the class of your Java program that has your <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> method then you will need to import that class into your controller.</p>

<p>Finally, you do not need to create another controller inside <code>src/java</code>. Controllers exist within the <code>grails-app/controllers</code> directory structure.</p>

<p>Following the instructions provided in the linked post in your question should give you all you need to accomplish calling your Java program from a Grails controller.</p>
