<p>In the view in which you want to detect touch events, override:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesBeganWithEvent:(NSEvent *)event {
    NSSet *touches = [event touchesMatchingPhase:NSTouchPhaseTouching inView:self];
    if (touches.count == 4) 
        NSLog(@"4 finger touch detected");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to enable the view to receive touch events with:</p>

<pre><code>[self setAcceptsTouchEvents:YES]
</code></pre>
