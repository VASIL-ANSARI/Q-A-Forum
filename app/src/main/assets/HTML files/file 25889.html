<p>I don't know much about python, but I have done a lot between Delphi, C++, C# and Java even with COBOL.<p>Anyway, to send a record from Delphi to C first you need to pack the record at both ends, </p>

<p>in Deplhi </p>

<pre><code>MyRecord = pack record
</code></pre>

<p>in C++</p>

<pre><code>#pragma pack(1) 
</code></pre>

<p>I donât know in python but I guess there must be a similar one.  Make sure that at both sides the sizeof(MyRecord) is the same length.</p>Also, before sending the records, you should take care about byte ordering (you know, Little-Endian vs Big-Endian),  use the Socket.htonl() and Socket.ntohl() in python and the equivalent in Deplhi which are in WinSock unit. Also a "double" in Delphi could not be the same as in python, in Delphi is 8 bytes check this as well, and change it to Single(4 bytes) or Extended (10 bytes) whichever matches.
If all that match then you could send/receive binary records in one shut, otherwise, I'm afraid, you have to send the individual fields one by one.</p>
