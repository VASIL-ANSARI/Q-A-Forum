<p>There are plenty of reasons to ditch remoting; a few might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of transport flexibility</li>
<li>versioning requirements are huge pain</li>
<li>platform dependent (no sensible chance of cross-platform usage)</li>
<li>no chance of usage from the growing mobile market</li>
<li>lack of future development: whatever feature you want added - it won't be</li>
</ul>

<p>however, I would disagree that WCF is the automatic replacement; WCF itself is a pretty versatile tool, but can be pretty complex, and has restrictions of its own. I haven't used it myself, but I have seen <strong><em>lots</em></strong> of praise for <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/">Service Stack</a>, essentially with users describing it as "WCF done right", i.e. the good bits of WCF, without the pain points. However, there are plenty of other options too. One nice thing about the idea of Service Stack, though, is that it iterates pretty quickly, and if it lacks something you want <em>you can change it</em>.</p>
