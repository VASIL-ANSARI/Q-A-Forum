<p>do you need the <code>[1, 2]</code> to be preserved as an array?  what would this exactly enable you to do?  I'm not familiar with "composite keys" so maybe a short explanation for link to one to clarify would help me understand your problem better.</p>

<p>if you just want to use <code>[1, 2]</code> as a key, you can always use that as a string:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {  
  "[1, 2]": 3
}
</code></pre>

<p>but again, i would assume you would want to keep <code>[1, 2]</code> as an array.</p>
