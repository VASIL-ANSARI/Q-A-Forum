<p>Yes, you need to have a gateway/proxy application of sorts somewhere to provide the additional level of validation and security that you're looking for. On the bright side it really doesn't have to be anything fancy.</p>

<p>A small web server with code written in your favorite language running on a micro-instance (assuming you won't get to much traffic) which simply takes requests from your mobile application, performs some small level of validation (i.e that the format of the data matches what you'd expect to see from your clients) and then sends it of as a properly formatted PUT-request to your SimpleDB domain.</p>
