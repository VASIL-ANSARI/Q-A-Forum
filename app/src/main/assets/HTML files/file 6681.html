<p>If possible, you might think about directly using <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/using_xmpp.html" rel="nofollow">XMPP</a>.  There are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=c%23+xmpp+library" rel="nofollow">several</a> for C#.</p>

<p>You might want to get yourself a copy of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" rel="nofollow">FireFox</a> + <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">FireBug</a>.  Then take a look at the 'net' tab of FireBug, while playing with someones <a href="http://chat.latest.gaejava.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">demo app</a> (or make your own).  You should be able to follow the requests through, then emulate them in your C# code.</p>

<p><strong>clarification</strong>:
  I am not suggesting to use XMPP to talk to the <em>channel API</em> but for the communication between your client application and your App Engine app.  I suggested using FireBug because it will be very clear that the traffic <em>is</em> JSON.</p>
