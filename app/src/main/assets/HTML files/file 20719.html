<p>Sqlite is not happy about the lack of a file access mode being specified in your flags.  It doesn't know whether it should open it writable or not, or whether or not to create it if it does not exist.  Therefore, add the following two flags along with the one you are currently using:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE<br>SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This signals that sqlite should open a writable database, and create it if it does not exist.</p>
