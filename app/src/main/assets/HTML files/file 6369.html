<p>It depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If this is how your table will always look, you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var cells = document.getElementsByClassName('clsReadOnly');

cells[2].innerHTML = "Row1 Column3";
cells[5].innerHTML = "Row2 Column3";
cells[8].innerHTML = "Row3 Column3";
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know how many columns you will start with, you would have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>var rows = document.getElementsByTagName('tr');

for (var i=0; i&lt;rows.length; i++) {
    var cells = rows[i].getElementsByTagName('td');

    cells[2].innerHTML = 'Row'+(i+1)+' Column3';
}
</code></pre>

<p>jQuery would make this much easier, as you can select by tag, by parent, etc.  Of course, you can do all of this in plain JavaScript, but it takes a lot more work.</p>
