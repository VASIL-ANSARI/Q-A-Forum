<p>I maintain a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cookies/" rel="nofollow">JavaScript library for cookie manipulation</a> which does not require jQuery. If jQuery is present, it does provide some bindings for it and aliases itself in the jQ namespace, but jQ is not needed.</p>

<p>For the time being both the lib and the jQuery add-ons are in the same file, but I am working on a new release which will split the two sections of code apart so that those who do not use jQuery can run a lighter weight version.</p>

<p>I have released it under a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cookies/wiki/License" rel="nofollow">number of licenses</a>, and if those don't work for you let me know and I will see what I can do about making it more comfortable for you
