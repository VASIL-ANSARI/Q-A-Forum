<p>Calling the property name without "self." skips the setter and updates the instance variable directly.</p>

<p>To avoid the confusion and potential memory leaks, I like to rename the instance variable of the synthesized property like this:</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize objA = _objA;
</code></pre>

<p>Your class would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyObject : NSObject
    ...
    @property (nonatomic, retain) ObjectA *objA;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you forget "self.", you'll get a compiler error and it'll be more explicit about which variable you're actually using.</p>
