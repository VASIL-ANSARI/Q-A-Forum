<p>Did you overide all abstract methods from your listener ? 
something like that  :</p>

<pre><code>public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
     aboutFrame.dispose();      
}

public void windowClosed(WindowEvent e) {
}

public void windowIconified(WindowEvent e) {
}

public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e) {
}

public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e) {
}

public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e) {
}
</code></pre>
