<p>If you want to pick ten from <code>Spots</code> and then filter out the ones in <code>news_headlines</code>, it would be something like this (warning: LINQ syntax in VB entirely from memory):</p>

<pre><code>Dim spots1 = (From n In news_list Take (10) Select n)
Dim spots2 = (From n in spots1 Where Not news_headlines.Contains(n) Select n)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to filter out the ones in <code>news_headlines</code> and then pick ten, it would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim spots1 = (From n In news_list Where Not news_headlines.Contains(n) Select n)
Dim spots2 = (From n in spots1 Take (10) select n)
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course combine the two queries.  Note that I'm assuming <code>news_headlines</code> is not null.  I'm also assuming that your news items are either the same object instances or implement <code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
