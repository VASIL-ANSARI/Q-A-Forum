<p>The example of #{guestlist.size()} only sets the initial value of the property, not the policy for keeping it up-to-date. Assuming you're not using lazy loading, Spring instantiates Spring managed beans from the application context at startup. From that point on it's up to the developer to handle updating property values. </p>
