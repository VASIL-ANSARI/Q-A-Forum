<p>Well I'd love to know how the first one works if you're using a <code>class</code> selector to target a div that is marked by its <code>ID</code>, but never mind that.</p>

<p>The second selector is targeting elements that have both the classes <code>connier</code> and <code>the_otherbg</code>, whereas the element you want to target only has <code>the_otherbg</code>. Try just removing the <code>.connier</code> from the selector.</p>
