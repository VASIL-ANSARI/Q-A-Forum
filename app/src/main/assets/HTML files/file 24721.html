<p>As to "run on double click", this is OS dependent.</p>

<p>You can "run a jar" at the command line using:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar the.jar
</code></pre>

<p>This requires that the jar has a <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> and that this manifest file has a <code>Main-Class</code> entry, the argument being the class where your <code>main()</code> method is. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>Main-Class: org.foobar.mypackage.Foo
</code></pre>
