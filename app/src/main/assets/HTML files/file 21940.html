<p>Your question is rather vague, but I'll try to answer as best as I could.</p>

<p>I think, normally, you need to define the type of command that you are going to pass into the <code>SqlCommand</code>, before executing that command.<br>

<br>

<code>    command.Commandtype = CommandType.StoredProcedure;</code>

<br>
(OR)
<br>

<code>    command.CommandText = CommandType.Text;</code>

</p>

<p>
You can set the SQL query in string value after that.<br>


<code>    command.CommandText = "";   // your SQL query, or the name of the stored procedure<br></code>

</p>

<p>Also, you don't need to set the <code>DataSource</code> of the grid twice. You only need to set it after you got the result of you SQL query execution is returned.<br>
However you receive the result is your choice. But, you seemed to executed the command twice, with both <code>GetData()</code> method and <code>command.ExecuteReader()</code> method. And also, you are setting the <code>DataSource</code> of your grid twice too.</p>

<p>
I think even if you managed to set up the command object properly, because of your double executions, data might be lost somehow between them. 
</p>

<p>And, by the way, what data type is returned from the <code>createSQLQuery()</code> method. You said it returned a valid SQL Query, but is it returned a valid sql query value in <code>string</code>, or your custom command object to parse into the <code>SqlCommand</code>?</p>

<p>I'll include the best operable procedure I know for reading from the SQL database and bind that data into the grid control. <br></p>

<pre><code>// I suppose you get the connection object as 'con'
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand();
cmd.Connection = con;
cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
cmd.CommandText = "...";   // You desired SQL query goes here, or if you want to execute a stored procedure, set the command type as 'StoredProcedure' and text as sp name.

SqlDataAdapter dap = new SqlDataAdapter();
dap.SelectCommand = cmd;
DataTable tbl = new DataTable();
dap.Fill(tbl);
&lt;br&gt;
if (tbl.Rows.Count &gt; 0)
{
    grid.DataSource = tbl;
    grid.DataBind();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend you to receive the result as <code>DataTable</code> rather than <code>SqlDataReader</code>. Cause <code>DataTable</code> is more flexible and versatile. </p>
