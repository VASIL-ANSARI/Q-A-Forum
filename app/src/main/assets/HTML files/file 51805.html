<p>well after whacking my head for 1 month I realized that the culprit was a</p>

<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
        -webkit-transform:none;}
</code></pre>

<p>setting in a totally unrelated css file that was preventing the slider in portrait mode. In landscape mode, the viewport width was more than 500px and therefore the slider was working fine. I am sure I am missing a best practice on preventing such things.</p>
