<p>Even though the frame property can be animated, it is not the recommended way to animate a view.</p>

<p>Instead I suggest that you apply a CGAffineTransform to transform property of the UIImageView.</p>

<p>Here is the Docs link: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGAffineTransform/Reference/reference.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGAffineTransform/Reference/reference.html</a></p>

<p>In your case, you would apply a scale and translation transform to your image views.  Keep in mind that if you want to apply two transforms,you will have to combine them into one first.</p>
