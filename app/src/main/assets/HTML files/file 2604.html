<p>Most of what I work on deals with statically linked libraries, so this answer may not apply, but may clue you in to the problem. So based on that and what I'm looking at right now, my first thought would be to check that in the dll you're building, you've included the static library.</p>

<p>An unresolved symbol usually means that either the signature doesn't match or you're not including the necessary library. It varies from compiler to compiler, but most make you specify the library directory (sometimes denoted by -L in a command line) and the actual library to be linked in (sometimes denoted by -l). </p>

<p>Since I don't use DLL's that much, my understanding of them is similar to building an executable. If you use dynamic linking when you build, the path of the libraries you are linking to are embedded in your executable, so your executable size is smaller, but is dependent on the library path they are linked to on not moving. </p>

<p>So when you're building your DLL, make sure you've compiled the cpp for class gph and created a static library for it. Then when you use it in class A, you include the header  and link in the library.</p>
