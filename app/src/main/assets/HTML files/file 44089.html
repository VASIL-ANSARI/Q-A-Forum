<p>A URL is a reference to data. The data is a (possibly complicated) encoding of something like a movie.</p>

<p>I am not sure exactly what you are asking, but I think you want to get the data (as an NSData object) and then save it somewhere. If this is correct, then what you need to do is</p>

<pre><code>[self.data writeToFile:myFilePath atomically:YES]
</code></pre>

<p>where myFilePath is a path to somewhere where you can store files.</p>
