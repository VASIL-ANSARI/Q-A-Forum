<p>You are getting a warning, as you multiply 1.8 (which is a <code>double</code> literal) with <code>cs</code>, yielding a <code>double</code>. In C++, if you have an expression with two different types, a <em>type promotion</em> is performed to the type with the largest value range; for <code>double</code> and <code>float</code> this means that <code>cs</code> is converted to <code>double</code>. This is then assigned to a <code>float</code>, which might not be able to represent the full value range of <code>double</code> (<code>float</code> is a 32-bit IEEE floating point number, <code>double</code> is 64-bit.) Hence the warning.</p>

<p>You can fix this by writing:</p>

<pre><code>f=1.8f*cs+32.0f;
</code></pre>

<p>or by changing <code>f</code> to be of type <code>double</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Your code is compiling, this is just a warning, not an error.</p>
