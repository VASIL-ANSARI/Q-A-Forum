<p>i've used <a href="http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=256" rel="nofollow">this approach</a> before to help with post-ajax stuff on the page. very useful. you'll still have to figure out how to save the value of the problem-dropdown and reapply the value. you could save the value, pre-POST, to a hidden field on the page, the reapply it, end-POST. hth.</p>
