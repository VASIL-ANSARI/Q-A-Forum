<p>It's most likely you have not included the required header file. </p>

<p>Main header for opencv c++ api is in <code>opencv.hpp</code>, while the function you ask specifically (<code>cv::line</code>) is in <code>imgproc.hpp</code> (which is also included in most general <code>opencv.hpp</code>)</p>
