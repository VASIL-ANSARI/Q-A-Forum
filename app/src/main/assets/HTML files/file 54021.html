<p>I believe the class name is the channel name.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable" rel="nofollow">ActionCable</a> docs:</p>

<pre><code># app/channels/appearance_channel.rb
class AppearanceChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    current_user.appear
  end

  def unsubscribed
    current_user.disappear
  end

  def appear(data)
    current_user.appear on: data['appearing_on']
  end

  def away
    current_user.away
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And the client subscribes as follows:</p>

<pre><code># app/assets/javascripts/cable/subscriptions/appearance.coffee
App.cable.subscriptions.create "AppearanceChannel",
  # Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
  connected: -&gt;
    @install()
    @appear()

  # Called when the WebSocket connection is closed
  disconnected: -&gt;
    @uninstall()

  # Called when the subscription is rejected by the server
  rejected: -&gt;
    @uninstall()

  appear: -&gt;
    # Calls `AppearanceChannel#appear(data)` on the server
    @perform("appear", appearing_on: $("main").data("appearing-on"))

  away: -&gt;
    # Calls `AppearanceChannel#away` on the server
    @perform("away")


  buttonSelector = "[data-behavior~=appear_away]"

  install: -&gt;
    $(document).on "page:change.appearance", =&gt;
      @appear()

    $(document).on "click.appearance", buttonSelector, =&gt;
      @away()
      false

    $(buttonSelector).show()

  uninstall: -&gt;
    $(document).off(".appearance")
    $(buttonSelector).hide()
</code></pre>

<p>If you look closely, client is subscribing to the channel <code>AppearanceChannel</code> which is the name of the class.</p>
