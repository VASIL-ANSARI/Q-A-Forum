<p>What happened here is usually caused by the binding between activity and the service. The activity has been stopped and thus the system thinks the service is no longer required and probably stops the service, which causes that error.</p>

<p>A quick fix would be add <strong>unbindService(mConnection);</strong> in your onstop() or onDestroy() method. </p>

<p>If you want to make the service running even after the activity that started it has been destroyed, you should first use <strong>startService</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>ComponentName myService = startService(new Intent(this, myClass.class));
bindService(new Intent(this, myClass.class), myServiceConn, BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
</code></pre>

<p>From Android docs:</p>

<p>For <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#startService%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow">startService</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using startService() overrides the default service lifetime that is
  managed by bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int): it requires
  the service to remain running until stopService(Intent) is called,
  regardless of whether any clients are connected to it.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#bindService%28android.content.Intent,%20android.content.ServiceConnection,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">bindService</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The service will be considered required by the system only for as long
  as the calling context exists. For example, if this Context is an
  Activity that is stopped, the service will not be required to continue
  running until the Activity is resumed.</p>
