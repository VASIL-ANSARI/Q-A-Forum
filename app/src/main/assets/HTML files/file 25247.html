<p>Are you going to be consistently loading and using the ENTIRE data-set, or will you only really want part of it?</p>

<p>Use a database (mySql or Sqlite or whatever) if you want something the database gives you, specifically in this case the ability to query your data-set.  (security and normalization and standardization ate nice, too.)</p>

<p>Use a raw file (csv, xml, json) if you don't want anything a database provides, and want to load he entire data-set into memory anyway.</p>
