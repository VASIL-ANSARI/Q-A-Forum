<p>I suppose you are using <a href="https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine" rel="nofollow">this plugin</a>, but the options seem to differ, so maybe you are using an old version of this.</p>

<p>Anyhow, you are passing an object to the <code>validationEngine</code>-function, but you are breaking the syntax by simply putting a function-definition, an alert-call and so on into it.</p>

<p>The "success"-function, that is mentioned in the code-comment, must be defined as property of the object you are passing to the function as parameter. </p>

<p>So, this should probably look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
        // SUCCESS AJAX CALL, replace "success: false," by:     success : function() { callSuccessFunction() }, 
        $("#form1").validationEngine({
            ajaxSubmit: true,
            ajaxSubmitFile: "note/note.php",
            success: function(){
                window.alert("Report Sent!");

                //write a confirmation to the user
                document.getElementById("update").innerHTML="Report Sent!";

                setTimeout(function(){
                   document.getElementById("update").innerHTML="";
                },3000);

            }
        });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>success</code> - property carries an anonymous-function, that will be executed by the plugin as "callback" - function, after the validation was successful.</p>

<p>And I changed your <code>setInterval</code> to a <code>setTimeout</code> as I think there won't be a reason to clear the content of an already empty element all 3 seconds again.</p>

<p>As stated above, the property-names aren't the right ones for the plugin I linked, if that's the one you are actually using. If so, check the <a href="http://posabsolute.github.com/jQuery-Validation-Engine/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, but the main problem in your script is the faulty object syntax.</p>
