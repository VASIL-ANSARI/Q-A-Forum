<p>Since it's not possible to map keys depending our your actions (like in VS) its not possible to get an <em>exact</em> dublicate of VS keymapping. Anyway you can make your own:</p>

<p><strong><code>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Keymap -&gt; Manage Profiles</code></strong> there you duplicate the current one <em>(as a backup)</em></p>

<p>Now you can change the key's towards VS2010.</p>
