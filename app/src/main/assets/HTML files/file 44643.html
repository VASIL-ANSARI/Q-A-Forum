<p>Since you webserver (hopefully) doesn't run as the <code>root</code>-User, placing your database in the <code>/root</code> directory will not work.</p>

<p>You habe to put the database in a directory that is writable by your webserver (as it looks to me, that would be <code>/var/www</code> for you).</p>

<p>And just to prevent further privilege problems, the database file needs to be readable and writable by the webserver as well. On Ubuntu/Debian systems, this can be done with</p>

<pre><code>chown www-data:www-data /var/www/example.db
</code></pre>
