<p>In general, testing for equality with floating point arithmetic is a bad idea.  I don't know if your math and/or your coding are OK, but I'd guess that the chances are <code>x</code> will never be exactly equal to zero.  Consider changing it to something like <code>while (fabs(x) &lt; 1e-10)</code>.</p>
