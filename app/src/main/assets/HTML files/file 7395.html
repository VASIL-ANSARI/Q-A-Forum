<p><code>sender</code> is the object that fired the event (in your case, a <code>Button</code> object), not the value of a property of the object.  If you really need to write code that checks the <code>Name</code> property of a control (which I would advise against for future maintenance reasons...) you will need to cast it like so:</p>

<pre><code>switch(((Button)sender).Name)
{
    case "whatever":
        break;
    // more here
}
</code></pre>

<p>The debugger is your friend here.  You can set a breakpoint inside your method to inspect the object that is being passed in.</p>
