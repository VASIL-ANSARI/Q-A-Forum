<p>Image flickers because as soon as you hove over the image, you change the source of the image. Therefore, now your mouse is hovering over another image and not the one you intended.</p>

<p>As soon as the mouse comes over the newly loaded image, the new image gets hidden because your mouse is now not hovering over the older image. The moment it gets hidden, you mouse again comes over the older image and so the new image is once again visible.</p>

<p>The process continues giving a flickering effect. old image - new image - old image ....and so on</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
