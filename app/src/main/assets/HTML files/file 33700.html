<p>You have to insert these lines inside the if statement. </p>

<pre><code>$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
$from = 'From: Hola'; 
$to = 'test@yahoo.com'; 
$subject = 'Hola';

$body = "From: $name\n E-Mail: $email\n Message:\n $message";
</code></pre>

<p>When the html page loads, the name for example doesn't exists. It's been set after clicking on the submit button. So if you put it inside the if statement, the script will read the variables only after the submit button is posted.</p>

<p>Anyway, for your future consideration, these are not errors, are warnings, the script still works.</p>
