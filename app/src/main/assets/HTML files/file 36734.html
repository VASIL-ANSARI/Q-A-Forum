<p>A pointer on your machine is 4 bytes wide. If you want to get the size of the object pointed to by the pointer you must dereference it:</p>

<pre><code>long iSize = sizeof(tData);  // Gets size of pointer = 4
iSize = sizeof(*tData);      // Gets size of pointed object, which is sizeof(void), which is implementation defined
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately dereferencing a <code>void *</code> is not very useful to you, as its implementation defined (or undefined) and even if it is defined it would not help you get the size of the byte array.</p>
