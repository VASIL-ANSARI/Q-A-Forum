<pre><code>int UB(int x) { if (x) return; }

<p>This is not even undefined behavior, it is a <em>constraint violation</em>. The cited text </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A return statement without an expression shall only appear in a
  function whose return type is void</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from 6.8.6.4 is normative, meaning the compiler is not allowed to let it slip without giving a diagnostic message. If it compiles without giving a diagnostic, the compiler is not a conforming implementation (doesn't follow the language standard).</p>

<p>In plain English this means: that code should not even compile. </p>

<p>Now if the compiler does produce a binary executable even if the code had constraint violations, all bets are off. It is no longer a C program, but some non-standard one, with no guaranteed behavior by any language standard.</p>
