<p>Have a look at the code within the <code>main.m</code>  file. </p>

<pre><code>UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class])); 
</code></pre>

<p>There the last argument is the name of your <code>AppDelegate</code> class.  <code>UIApplicationMain()</code> will register your <code>AppDelegate</code> as the delegate of your application object.  </p>

<p>If you are storyboard the creation of window and root view controller within the AppDelegate is not required as you said, instead <code>UIApplicationMain()</code> will load the <code>MainStoryboard</code> there it will create the window and root view controller.  </p>
