<p>The cross domain issue only occurs when you test your app code on PC browser after code below is inserted into config.xml.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;access origin="*" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(1) Not post your image and check if text data could be posted well.</p>

<p>(2) Use phonegap "Filetransfer" to post data includes images.</p>
