<p>Thanks to JohnB for the answer:</p>

<p>In the case, where there is one specialization for only the class (e.g. <code>T=int</code>), and another specialization for only the member (e.g. <code>U=int</code>), it would be impossible to decide, which specialization to use.</p>

<p>Another point by skyjpack:</p>

<p>There could be a class specialization without the member function.</p>
