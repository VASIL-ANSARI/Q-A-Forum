<p>I figured it out.</p>

<p>In stead of writing it as above, do this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void doSomething(View v) {
  if (hasRight == false){
    doShowPINDialogFragment();
  } else {
    loadFragmentB(); 
  } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you loadFragmentB only when hasRight!=false.  If false however, you call doShowPINDialogFragment() which creates and shows dialog fragment as explained above.</p>

<p>It also defines interface with a callback that is then executes in same java file as code above.  That callback fires on positive button click and will also call loadFragmentB().</p>
