<h1>It varies.</h1>

<p>In my case, I have an online game. There is a core JS file that all pages use (some people would use jQuery, but I have a custom toolbox - it's effectively the same thing). Then there are individual JS files for each page, such as <code>party.js</code>, <code>summary.js</code>, <code>forum.js</code> and so on. So each page of the site loads two JS files in total.</p>

<p>Now, I <em>could</em> simply compile all of those individual JS files into one big one. But if I have just the tiniest edit in one of the most obscure pages of the site? Suddenly everyone has to re-download the entire massive file.</p>

<p>With my system, they would only have to download the individual file that changed. Since the game is in ongoing development, this is probably for the best.</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> if you have a site that's basically done, and will only be getting minor patches or infrequent updates, then compiling everything into one file will be better overall, because visitors will download it once and then not have to worry about it.</p>

<p>So, basically, it varies.</p>
