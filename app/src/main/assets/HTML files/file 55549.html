<p>This pattern you tak about is called singleton (and is often called an antipattern). It should looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>struct MySingleton {
static MySingleton&amp; getInstance() {
   static MySingleton singleton;
   return singleton;
}
};
</code></pre>

<p>better aproach would be to pass <code>Communication</code> instance to each of you class as a parameter to constructor. You could also wrap it into <code>shared_ptr</code> so that once all the classes will no longer refer to it, destructor of Communication object will automatically be called.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if possible, also some arguments on why that pattern is better than the "include and extern" code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think one issue you may encounter is how your Communication object lifetime is managed. It should be created before first use, and I suppose it should be destroyed after any other class or function might want to use it.</p>

<p>I am not sure if singleton is good for Communication object, I assume you use it to make a connection with server and after a while you Disconnect. This can be done with Sigleton, but from my experience Singletons are used more for objects which lifetime is a lot longer, like for the whole duration of application.</p>
