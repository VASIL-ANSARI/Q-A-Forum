<p>When you create a new context using <code>SP.ClientContext(url)</code> the url parameter needs to point to a site within the current site collection. The SharePoint JavaScript client object model does not support access across different site collections.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to use REST or SharePoint's other web services to access the other site.</p>
