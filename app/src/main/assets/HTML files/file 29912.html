<p>DRY is a good ruby practice, so the answer to your question is: YES</p>

<p>Regarding your code you will probably use <code>send</code> in such a situation.</p>

<p>something like <code>self.send("number_of_#{race}_#{gender}_#{management_type}_managers=", managers.send(native).send(race).send(gender).send(management_type).count</code>)</p>

<p>This still looks pretty ugly to me. I am kind of asking myself why that datastructure is so insane. Why are you not using a simple hash structure here?</p>
