<p>Although there may be some add-on target to do this. My gut feeling is that you would use the <code>MARK</code> target to mark this packet then use <code>iproute2</code> to set up the routing of where you want it to go.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t mangle -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.2 -j MARK --set-mark 0xAA
</code></pre>

<p><code>ip rule add fwmark 0xAA table Reroute_Tunnel</code></p>

<p>Then it's up to you to add and decide what the <code>Reroute_Tunnel</code> table does</p>
