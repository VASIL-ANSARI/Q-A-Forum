<p>Ok, I go it. No comments or answers so far, but, rather then delete the question, I will leave it here in case it helps anyone in future.</p>

<p>I Googled further and found <a href="https://www.webcodegeeks.com/python/python-subprocess-example/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, which, at 1.2 says  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One way of gaining access to the output of the executed command would
  be to use PIPE in the arguments stdout or stderr, but the child
  process will block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up
  the OS pipe buffer as the pipes are not being read from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure enough, when I deleted the <code>, stdout=subprocess.PIPE</code> from the code above, it worked as expected.</p>

<p>As I only want the exit code from the subprocess, the above code is enough for me. Read the linked page if you want the output of the command.</p>
