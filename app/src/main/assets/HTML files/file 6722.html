  <p>Is it because Slovenia needs this encoding to assimilate certain letters in their alphabet?</p>

<p>Probably not because UTF-8 already covers all imaginable characters. The collation probably contains sorting and comparison rules specific to Slovenia. (See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3324900">here</a> for an overview what a collation does and how sorting rules can vary.)</p>

<p>you should be able to use one of the <code>_general</code> collations if you don't need any country specific rules. </p>
