<p>The content of the file should not be set in the metadata but sent along the metadata using an HTTP multipart request.
The client library takes care of doing that and you can set the content using:</p>

<pre><code>newEntry.setFile(/* java.io.File instance */ file, /* MIME type */ "text/csv");
</code></pre>
