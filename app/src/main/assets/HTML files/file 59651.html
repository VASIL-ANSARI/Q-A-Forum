<p>This is just a guess of mine, I have no idea if this works.</p>

<p>Sometimes the character encoding is wrong because text files may have a BOM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">Byte Order Mark</a>) and just arbitrary binary data can interfere with it. You can force the encoding to ASCII by reading the data in as a binary <code>byte[]</code> and then converting it into ASCII as shown here:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] data;

data = File.ReadAllBytes(@"E:\test\stream.txt");
string base64 = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data);
data = Convert.FromBase64String(base64);
File.WriteAllBytes(@"E:\test\file.pdf", data);
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see if this solves anything.</p>
