<p>HTML is not always follows XML rules, for example there are tags in html, that may not have close tag, so XPath and XDocument will sometimes throw errors. IE API gives you ability to do that(see <a href="http://ryanfarley.com/blog/archive/2004/12/23/1330.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>), you can also find 3-rd party parsers for that (see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/TagBasedHtmlParser.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> o  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/apmilhtml.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</p>
