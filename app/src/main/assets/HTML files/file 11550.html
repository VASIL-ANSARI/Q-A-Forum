<p>Sounds like you should use a <strong>trie</strong>. It's a pretty straightforward tree-structure, details and implementation examples can be found on wikipedia:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your needs, you could further improve space-efficiency using suffix compression or packing (beware, after you've done those, your trie will no longer be modifyable).</p>

<p>Also, I would consider if you actually have to delete all items from your dictionary-structure that do not match the given prefix. With tries, you could eliminate invalid words by simply "looking" at the relevant subtree and only considering those entries.</p>

<p>hope it helped</p>
