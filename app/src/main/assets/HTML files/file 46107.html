<p>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4918287/tim-kos">Tim Kos</a> I realize css includes z axis. Ui elements are stock from the fartest (0) to the closest in relation with the viewer (3 or n). Note it also admits negative numbers...</p>

<p>So, to avoid grid trouble with Bootstrap all was needed was to overlay the menu over the rest of the page by adding the last line in this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>.navbar-vertical-left {
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 130px;
  overflow: hidden;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 0;
  margin: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks.</p>
