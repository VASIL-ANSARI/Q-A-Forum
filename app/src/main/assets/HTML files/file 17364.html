<p>Replace newwindow.Triggers through Window.Triggers and newwindow.Loaded through Window.Loaded.</p>

<p>The programm knows that you want to refer to your newwindow because its in the xaml of your newwindow-Window (And consider renaming your "newwindow")^^.</p>

<p>(You could have edited your old Question...)</p>
