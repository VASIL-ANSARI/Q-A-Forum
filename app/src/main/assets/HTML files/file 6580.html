<p>I am not 100% sure what you are asking here, but if you want to get a list of all the files on the server using something along the lines of:-</p>

<pre><code>string[] files = 
Directory.GetFiles
  (@"c:\myfolder\", "*.exe", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly); 
</code></pre>

<p>or using linq</p>

<pre><code>var files = from f in Directory.GetFiles(@"c:\myfolder\")
    where f.Contains(".exe")
    select f;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get all the files then you need to iterate through the results and work out which one you want to return.</p>

<p>We probably need more info...</p>
