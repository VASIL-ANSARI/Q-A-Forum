<p>The issue probably that the page object classes aren't being initialised in the same 'world' as cucumber is running in.  Adding the files to env adds them and their methods to the world that cucumber is running.  You have to pass that world into your page objects when they are created to give them access to those functions.</p>

<p>Have your page object classes inherit from calabashes page object bases - <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/calabash-cucumber/Calabash/IBase" rel="nofollow">http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/calabash-cucumber/Calabash/IBase</a>
and when you create a new instance of a page object pass in self.</p>

<pre><code>class MyPage &lt; Calabash::IBase
...

new_instance_of_page_object = MyPage.new(self)
</code></pre>

<p>In this specific case, inheriting from IBase will give you access to the functions you are talking about, but passing in self will mean you have access to any other things that you have added in your env file.</p>
