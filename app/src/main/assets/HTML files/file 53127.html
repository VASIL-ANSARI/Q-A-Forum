<p>Depends if you want unit tests or UI tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit tests: Fast. Consistent. They confirm step-by-step. But they don't go end-to-end.</li>
<li>UI tests: Slow. Fragile. They confirm end-to-end.</li>
</ul>

<p>For unit testing, you wouldn't write tests that actually bring up a browser or interact with it in any way. Instead, you'd write tests that <em>would</em> bring up the browser, and tests that simulate different inputs <em>returned</em> from the browser.</p>

<p>This works as long as you're confident in the back-and-forth communication. If so, there's no need to test Apple's code. If not, then you can <a href="http://qualitycoding.org/spike-solution/" rel="nofollow">write a spike solution</a> to understand the communication.</p>
