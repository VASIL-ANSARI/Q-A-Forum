<p>If you are using a HTML textbox, one easy way to go is include the rows and columns within the  tag which will enable you to wrap the text.</p>

<p>See this link for more details:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1819748/how-to-word-wrap-in-normal-html-textbox">how to word wrap in normal html textbox?</a></p>

<p>The other option is to use a text-area which has a 'wrap' attribute:</p>

<p>The 'wrap' attribute has 3 values:</p>

<p>**
Soft<br>
Hard<br>
Off
** </p>

<p>Soft - sets the wrap to appear only in the HTML form - all line spacing and line breaks are not included when the form is submitted.</p>

<p>Hard - sets the wrap to appear in forms and line spacing and breaks are sent along with the form data.</p>

<p>Off - wrap is turned off and places the text is one ongoing line.</p>

<p>A sample example:
<code>
&lt;textarea cols="20" rows="5" wrap="hard"&gt;
 As you can see many times word wrapping is often the desired look for your textareas. Since it makes everything nice and easy to read and preserves line breaks.
&lt;/textarea&gt;</code></p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
