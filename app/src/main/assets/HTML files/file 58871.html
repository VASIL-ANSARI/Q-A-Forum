<p>I'm having a hard time understanding how 'Select All' is a valid heading. The heading is meant to provide context for the data in the associated cells. Used properly, a screenreader will read out the heading as you navigate into the column/row. </p>

<p>If someone navigates from a cell in the second column into a cell in the first, it would theoretically read </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"[h1]Select All checkbox unchecked[/h1] [td]input-label checkbox unchecked[td]" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(square bracket content added for clarity - if you are navigating from one column to the next, the column header is read out before the data for each new column you navigate into)</p>

<p>This hardly provides context as to what the checkbox is. The 'Select All' checkbox should more likely be used as the last element or even a footer element rather than a heading. </p>

<p>It's hard to fully understand without a code example, but I would suggest never including functional elements in a table heading. It's intended for phrasing content.</p>
