<p>Add @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) and make sure you set the request header "Content-Type:application/json". The former I don't think is required, but you should leave it anyway. The latter is the most important. For some reason your request is getting sent out with a "text/plain" header</p>

<p>The above comment by peeskillet is the right answer.</p>
