<p>First, you should probably be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2374416/why-use-simple-properties-instead-of-fields-in-c">using properties</a> for these things, not fields. However, I doubt that's part of your problem.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to create a map from <code>string</code> to <code>ContactKey</code>, you could try to make this part of the map from one <code>TicketFlag</code> to the other:</p>

<pre><code>Mapper.CreateMap&lt;LINQtoSQL.TicketFlag, Service.Layer.TicketFlag&gt;()
 .ForMember(dest =&gt; dest.ContactKey,
 mem =&gt; mem.ResolveUsing(src =&gt; ContactKeySerializer.Serialize(src.ContactKey)));
</code></pre>

<p>I think that would prevent the error you're getting.</p>
