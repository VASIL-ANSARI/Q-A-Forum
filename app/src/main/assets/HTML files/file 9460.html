<p>You are mixing server-side and JavaScript code together.  The result of your code would be to replace the content of your div with the literal HTML <code>&lt;jsp:include page='Home.htm'/&gt;</code>, rather than the HTML content of your Home.htm, as you intended.</p>

<p>To do what you want to do, you will need to perform an ajax call to retrieve the new contents from the server, then replace the old contents of the div with that.</p>

<p>Using a JavaScript library such as jQuery, this could be quite simple.  Your <code>container.innerHTML</code> line would become something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>$('#dist').load('Home.htm');
</code></pre>
