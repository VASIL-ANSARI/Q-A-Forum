<p>TIP: If you want to debug <code>Seed</code> you need to launch the debugger by code:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void Seed(dbEmployeePortal context)
{
    try
    {
        if(!Debugger.IsAttached)
            Debugger.Launch()
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    { // breakpoint here. This breakpoint needs to be set on the new visual studio that will open for the debug session.

    }
}
</code></pre>
