<p>I think you need a better explanation than "Doesn't work". Why doesn't this work?</p>

<pre><code>package revueserver;
public class ReVueServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class c = Stream.StreamClient.class;
        System.out.println(c.getName());
    }
}
</code></pre>
