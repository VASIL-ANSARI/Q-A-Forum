<p>Well, it depends on the implementation of the XML parser and schema validator, but I think it very likely that most implementations will require each text node (or attribute value) to fit within the limits of a Java (etc) string.</p>

<p>I think we're going to see an increasing incidence of problems in the next few years as we hit the 2^31 limit on sizes of strings, arrays, etc. It's going to be very tough to redesign programming languages like Java to get over this, since the use of (int) data type for addressing into such structures is so universal.</p>
