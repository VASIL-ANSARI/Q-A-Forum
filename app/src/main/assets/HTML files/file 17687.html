<p>Instead of declaring the variables as 'const' have your tired declaring them as 'readonly' ? 
This would enable you to simply instantiat the class only once :</p>

<pre><code>fullClassName shrtNm = New FullClassName();
</code></pre>

<p>then you would like to call it as with</p>

<pre><code>shrtNm.&lt;VariableName&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>Guessing from the use case you enumerated, I doubt the difference between using const and readonly should matter...</p>
