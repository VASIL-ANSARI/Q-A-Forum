<p>The likely reason is your call to <code>getData()</code> for the images in each cell. As far as I know there is no way to not reuse cells, as that's exaclty what the method is designed to do. The reason this is getting so slow is that the OS is trying to wait for each image to be loaded in order to display the cell, and doing this will bog it down very quickly. Instead what you need to do is set a default image for the cell, and then call <code>var imageData = imageToLoad.getDataInBackground({})</code>. This will allow the cells to be returned while scrolling, and then the images will be populated after they've loaded instead of waiting to draw the cell until the image is retrieved. </p>
