<p>The whole <em>User Instance and <code>AttachDbFileName=</code></em> approach is flawed - at best! Visual Studio will be copying around the <code>.mdf</code> file and <strong>most likely</strong>, your <code>INSERT</code> works just fine - but you're just looking at the <strong>wrong .mdf file</strong> in the end! </p>

<p>If you want to stick with this approach, then try putting a breakpoint on the <code>myConnection.Close()</code> call - and then inspect the <code>.mdf</code> file with SQL Server Mgmt Studio Express - I'm almost certain your data is there.</p>

<p>The <strong>real solution</strong> in my opinion would be to </p>

<ol>
<li><p>install SQL Server Express (and you've already done that anyway)</p></li>
<li><p>install SQL Server Management Studio Express</p></li>
<li><p>create your database in <strong>SSMS Express</strong>, give it a logical name (e.g. <code>SongsDatabase</code>) </p></li>
<li><p>connect to it using its logical <strong>database name</strong> (given when you create it on the server) - and don't mess around with physical database files and user instances. In that case, your connection string would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=SongsDatabase;Integrated Security=True
</code></pre>

<p>and everything else is <strong>exactly</strong> the same as before...</p></li>
</ol>
