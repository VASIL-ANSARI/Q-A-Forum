<p>Use the equality operator <code>==</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if url == "http://www.example.com":
    print("The URL is homepage")
else:
    print("The URL is not homepage")
</code></pre>

<p>It is convention to put the variable name on the LHS of the equality operator and the string you are testing it against on the RHS.</p>
