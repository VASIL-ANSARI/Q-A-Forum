<p>It's a bit unclear from your question, but assuming that the scripts can be executed in any order (<code>A, B, C</code>, <code>A, C, B</code>, <code>B, A, C</code>, etc.) then you don't have to change anything.</p>

<p>Javascript (in the browser) is single threaded, so the callbacks you are passing to <code>$.getJSON</code> will be scheduled serially.</p>
