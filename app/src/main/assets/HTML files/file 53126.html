<p>The reason why there's no entity in between Stage and Category is because there's nothing else in that relation that justifies the existence of an Entity (that's why it is a manyToMany).</p>

<p>What you want to do is to fetch join and filter the relationship:</p>

<pre><code>$qb = $this-&gt;createQueryBuilder('s')
        -&gt;select('s')
        -&gt;join('s.category','c')
        -&gt;where('c.category_id = :cat')
        -&gt;setParameter('cat', $cat);
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if <code>stage_category</code> would have a property that justified the existence of an entity, you would change your mapping to be a one-to-Many and many-To-One which would allow you to perform your original query using the query builder.</p>
