<p>The std::vector&lt;...> class is not designed to be used as a base class. Using it as such leads to undefined behaviour (because of the lack of a virtual destructor, at least).</p>

<p>Item 35 in C++ Coding Standards (Sutter, Alexandrescu), named</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid inheriting from classes that were not designed to be base
  classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>might well be of help here.</p>

<p>Item 7 of Effective C++ (Meyers) discuss the issue with this example:</p>

<pre><code>class SpecialString: public std::string{
...
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first glance, this may look innocuous, but if anywhere in an
  application you somehow convert a pointer-to-SpecialString into a
  pointer-to-string and you then use delete on the string pointer, you
  are instantly transported to the realm of undefined behavior.</p>
