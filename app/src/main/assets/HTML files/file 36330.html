<p>You are calling <code>animate</code> on both divs:</p>

<pre><code>$('.news-content, .products-content').animate({ "marginTop": animationOffset + "px" }, "1500");
</code></pre>

<p>This will animate both divs no matter which link you hover on. You only want to animate one div at a time. One way to do this is to pass the class of the div you want to animate to <code>animateContent</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$("#down, #down2").hover(function() {
    var classSelector;

    if (this.id == "down") {
        classSelector= '.news-content';
    } else {
        classSelector= '.products-content';
    }

    animateContent(classSelector, 'down');
}, function() {
    var classSelector;

    // you'll notice this is a bunch of repeated code.
    // perhaps you can find a way to clean it up?
    if (this.id == "down") {
        classSelector = '.news-content';
    } else {
        classSelector = '.products-content';
    }

    $(classSelector).stop();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then in <code>animateContent</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function animateContent(classSelector, direction) {
    // use classSelector in your jQuery selectors here
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are much simpler ways of doing this, by the way, but I wanted to give an example that builds on your existing code.</p>
