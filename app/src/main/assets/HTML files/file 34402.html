<p>I think the issue is just how you construct <code>$newRouteObjs</code> because you're passing in <code>[]</code> which is an unindexed array. Simply index it:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($routes as $key =&gt; $val)
{ 
    $routeObj = new Route($routes[$key]);

    //add [$key] as opposed to []
    $newRouteObjs[$key] = $routeObj;
}

return $newRouteObjs;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the dump:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [default_route] =&gt; Route Object
    (
        [name] =&gt; path
        [path] =&gt; /
        [controller] =&gt; IndexController
        [action] =&gt; indexAction
    )

    [hello_route] =&gt; Route Object
    (
        [name] =&gt; path
        [path] =&gt; /hello
        [controller] =&gt; HelloController
        [action] =&gt; helloAction
    )

)
</code></pre>
