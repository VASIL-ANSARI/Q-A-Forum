<li><p>Yes, it's true about the recursive saving when you save an object that includes pointers to other objects. All of the pointed-to objects will be saved. Since <code>game</code> points to <code>player</code>, <code>player</code> will also be saved when <code>game</code> is saved.</p></li>
<li><p>The changes in a related object, such as the player's name, should also be saved based on (1).</p></li>
<li><p>Since queries do not automatically retrieve related objects in a corresponding recursive manner, you are correct about needing to use includeKey to retrieve the related Player object when retrieving a Game.</p></li>
