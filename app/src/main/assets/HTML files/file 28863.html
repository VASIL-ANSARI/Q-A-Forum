<p>Did you try to replace your special characters by their HTML code ?</p>

<p>For example, <code>&amp;</code> could be replaced by <code>&amp;amp;</code> . I did it with a C# project and it worked, I suppose it could be the same with VB.NET</p>

<p>You can find all codes <a href="http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
