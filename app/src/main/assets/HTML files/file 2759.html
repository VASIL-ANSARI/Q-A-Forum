<p>If you modify your fetch request (such as by changing the predicate), you need to create a new fetched results controller.<br>
Alternatively, you could access your fetched objects as an array (using the <code>fetchedObjects</code> property of the fetched results controller) and filter that array based on the search criteria. This has the added benefit of aligning more with Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/TableSearch/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007848" rel="nofollow">sample code</a> for table search (since they use an array to back the table view).</p>
