<p>Yes, all that would copy the array only. Your copied array will still refer to the same objects. </p>

<p>I don't think (or just don't know how) that you can copy all contained objects in one go. I guess that you would have to iterate through the objects in the original array, copy each object and add its copy to a newly created and originally empty mutable array. 
How these objects are to be copied depends very much on the nature of these objects and on the purpose for copying them. </p>

<p>And yes, there is no reason why the objects within an immutable array should be immutable too. </p>
