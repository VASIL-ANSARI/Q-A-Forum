<p>So as i understand you need to change url dynamically so yes you can do it with addthis <a href="http://support.addthis.com/customer/portal/articles/125634-setting-the-url-to-share#.UtAZWJ5_tzo" rel="nofollow">More info</a></p>

<p>Generally you need to set attribute addthis:url and share this will know which url you are sharing</p>
