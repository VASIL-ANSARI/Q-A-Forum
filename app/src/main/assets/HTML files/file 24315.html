<p>Start with a pencil and index cards or paper, and start figuring out what features you need to do and what UI elements are needed. With that get a big table and play around with the cards - do you need one Nav Controller or a tabBarController with Nav controllers in it.</p>

<p>Once you have everything covered, wire the cards up, say left to right, or tape them to something and start connecting things. Once you have it 80% right you can start coding.</p>

<p>There is no magic tool that I know - the best one is probably between your ears! But don't start coding til you figured out how it all works.</p>
