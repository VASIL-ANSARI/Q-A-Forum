<p>You can use the <code>PShape#scale()</code> function to scale individual <code>PShape</code> instances.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://processing.org/reference/PShape_scale_.html" rel="nofollow">the reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>PShape s;

void setup() {
  s = loadShape("bot.svg");
}

void draw() {
  background(204);
  shape(s);
}

void mousePressed() {
  // Shrink the shape 90% each time the mouse is pressed
  s.scale(0.9);  
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Increases or decreases the size of a shape by expanding and
  contracting vertices. Shapes always scale from the relative origin of
  their bounding box. Scale values are specified as decimal percentages.
  For example, the method call scale(2.0) increases the dimension of a
  shape by 200%. Subsequent calls to the method multiply the effect. For
  example, calling scale(2.0) and then scale(1.5) is the same as
  scale(3.0). This transformation is applied directly to the shape; it's
  not refreshed each time draw() is run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could also use the more general <code>scale()</code> function. More info can be found in <a href="https://processing.org/reference/scale_.html" rel="nofollow">the reference</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you might also have to adjust where you draw your shapes, potentially using the <code>translate()</code> function.</p>
