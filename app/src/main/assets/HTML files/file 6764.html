<p>It depends on what you can assume about the minimum level of SSE support that you have.</p>

<p>Going all the way back to SSE2 you have <code>_mm_extract_epi16</code> (<code>PEXTRW</code>) which can be used to extract any 16 bit element from a 128 bit vector. You would need to call this twice to get the two halves of a 32 bit element.</p>

<p>In more recent versions of SSE (SSE4.1 and later) you have <code>_mm_extract_epi32</code> (<code>PEXTRD</code>) which can extract a 32 bit element in one instruction.</p>

<p>Alternatively if this is not inside a performance-critical loop you can just use a union, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>typedef union
{
    __m128i v;
    int32_t a[4];
} U32;
</code></pre>
