  <p>John would like to sell the App to us, but he refuse to hand in the
  keystore(which is used to sign the App). The reason is that John signs
  other Apps with the same keystore.</p>

<p>This shows why each app should be signed with dedicated key</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible that we can buy the App without getting the keystore, and the original user can continually receive the update?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it is not possible. You will not be able to release any update to existing app if it is signed with different key.</p>
