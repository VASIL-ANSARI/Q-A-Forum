  <p>camera saves it in default directory without asking me and I want to save it in my own folder created in sd card</p>

<p>You can tell the camera where you would like the photo to be stored <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#EXTRA_OUTPUT" rel="nofollow">via <code>EXTRA_OUTPUT</code></a>, as is shown in <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation's training module on <code>ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE</code></a>.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for all cameras to store images where you ask it to, though. If the file that you ask for does not exist after the image is taken, you will need to fall back to your existing application logic.</p>
