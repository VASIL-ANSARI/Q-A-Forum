<p>Now that I (think I) understand what you want, I think the simplest way to get started is something like this:</p>

<p>First, set up a stock icecast server. For now, just run it as a manually-configured standalone daemon.</p>

<p>Next, set up a stock ices or similar source client that just streams playlists that you give it through the server. Again, for now, configure and run it manually.</p>

<p>Next, write a Tornado server that serves up whatever UI, metadata, and/or stream addresses you want to clients.</p>

<p>You can write a custom client, or you can just serve up "radio playlist" .m3u files that will open in the user's default player. (This is just a file with the URL to the icecast stream address in it. Playing this .m3u in most media players will stream from the given URL, which is just serving up an infinitely-long MP3 file over HTTP.)</p>

<p>Most of what you might want to add on top of this, you'll be interacting with the source client. For example, you want to keep a database of tracks and generate the playlists dynamically. You may want end users to be able to add to or edit the database. And so on. Depending on how fancy you want to get, you may just want to drive ices by modifying its input files and running it as a child process (<code>subprocess.Popen</code>) so you can easily start and stop instances, or you may want to write a custom source client from scratch around shout-python.</p>

<p>If you also need to control the server, you can similarly drive it by editing its config files and running it as a child process.</p>
