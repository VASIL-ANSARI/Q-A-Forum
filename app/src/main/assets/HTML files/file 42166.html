<p>I don't know how your views are layed-out but maybe the cropping rect you're using, "self.snappedImageView.layer.frame" does not correspond to the area of the captured image displayed by the preview layer.</p>

<p>As I understand the the preview layer's frame is squared, right, and since it's video gravity is aspect filled, i think you could just get the biggest centered square for the image and use that as the cropping rect.</p>

<p>How about you try this rect</p>

<pre><code>CGSize size = image.size;
CGFloat side = fminf(size.width,size.height); //just the smaller dimension
CGrect croppingRect = CGRectMake((size.width-side)/2.f,(size.height-side)/2.f,side,side);
</code></pre>
