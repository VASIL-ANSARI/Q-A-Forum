<p>The d3.mouse method returns the x,y coordinates of the mouse event relative to the graph container.  The clientX and clientY values you are using to simulate the mouse event provide the x,y coordinates of the mouse event relative to the current window.  So, the coordinate sets are not the same.  You can manually calculate the same coordinate values as the d3.mouse method via:</p>

<pre><code> d3MouseX = clientX - rect.left
 d3MouseY = clientY - rect.top
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>rect.left</code> and <code>rect.top</code> are the coordinates of the bounding rectangle for the graph object.  You can get these coordinates with the <code>e.target.getBoundingClientRect()</code> method. </p>
