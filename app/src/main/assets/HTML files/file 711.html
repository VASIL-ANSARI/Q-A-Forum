<p>You're essentially trying to cache a view, which is always going to get tricky. You should  instead try to cache data only, because data rarely changes. Don't cache a forum, cache the thread rows. Then your db call should just return a list of ids, which you already have in your cache. The db call will be lightening fast on any MyISAM table, and then you don't have to do a big join, which eats db memory.</p>
