<p>In the code fragment you posted I don't see the actual query that limits the query scope. If query is omitted, all objects are returned.
Here is a fragment with explicit query:</p>

<pre><code>rally = RallyAPI::RallyRestJson.new(config)

query = RallyAPI::RallyQuery.new()
query.fetch = "Name,Owner"
query.type = :project   
query.query_string = "((Name = \"My Project\") OR (Parent.Name = \"My Project)\"))"

results = rally.find(query)

results.each do |p|
    p.read
    puts "opened project: #{p["Name"]} owner: #{p["Owner"]["_refObjectName"]}"
end
</code></pre>

<p>On a side note, 1.43 of WS API no longer supported. To use ruby toolkit with v2.0 of WS API your connection to Rally may include this config property:</p>

<pre><code>config[:version] = "v2.0"
</code></pre>
