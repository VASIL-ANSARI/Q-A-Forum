<p>Those are "javascript source map" files. If your <code>Subject.js</code> javascript file has been minimized/uglified, then you can generate and add a "map" file to let browsers know how to "unminimize"/"unuglify" your js file.</p>

<p>If the <code>Subject.js</code> file is written by you, then I guess your environment setup with different node.js and gulp.js modules has it enabled. Make sure those files are copied to your <code>/assets</code> folder as well.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can disable them by removing special comment at the end of your javascript file:</p>

<pre><code>//# sourceMappingURL=/assets/rxjs/Subject.js.map
</code></pre>

<p>Or, less likely, your server might be sending <code>X-SourceMap</code> header.</p>
