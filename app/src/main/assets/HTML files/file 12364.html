<p>One way to do this could be to calculate a vector for gravity.  If the phone isn't moving then the vector will remain fairly constant.  Should the phone be picked up it is likely that the orientation of the phone will change, thus the gravity vector will also change (in relation to the orientation of the accelerometer).</p>

<p>To detect movement simply calculate the angle between the original vector set on 'Activate' and the current vector.  Googling <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=angles%20between%203d%20vectors&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-GB%3aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">angles between 3d vectors</a> will help you out with the mathmatics behind this.</p>

<p>Theoretically someone could pick the phone up and maintain the exact orientation but this is incredibly unlikely.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and good luck.</p>
