<p>First off, ditch <code>.live</code>.  I added the <code>section</code> to give a more specific selector than <code>body</code>, but there's probably something better that you can use in your original DOM.</p>

<p>Just don't remove the last row with some simple logic.  Your logic for showing the future "del" link was actually already there!  You don't even really need the last-row-removal logic at all since just not displaying "del" is enough, but I was just being thorough.</p>
