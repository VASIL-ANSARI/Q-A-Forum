  <p>Why converting 37.3500 didn't give desired answer, while 37.3 gave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By accident. The representation of <code>37.3</code> happened to be close enough that rounding to 10 decimal places gave the expected result, while <code>37.3499984741</code> didn't.</p>

  <p>Is there any ways to reestablish double?</p>

<p>No, once information has been lost, you can't recover it. If you need an exact representation of decimal numbers, then you'll need a different format than binary floating point. There's no suitable decimal type in the C++ language or standard library; depending on your needs, you might consider libraries such as <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/intro.html" rel="nofollow">Boost.Multiprecision</a> or <a href="https://gmplib.org/" rel="nofollow">GMP</a>. Alternatively, if you can limit the number of decimal places you need, you might be able to multiply all your numbers by that scale and work with exact integers.</p>
