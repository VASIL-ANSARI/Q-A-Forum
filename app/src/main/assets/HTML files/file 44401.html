<p>crom could launch the shell script that launches the actual program . </p>

<p>in Linux, the '/' directory is the root of ALL file systems. So you definitely do not want to be unmount'ing it. do read the man page on mount/unmount. </p>

<p>You could place an appropriate entry in the fstab for a user mountable filesystem. then mount'ing/unmount'ing it would be relatively simple. </p>

<p>you could create a ''restricted' user that the script logs on/logs off. </p>

<p>That user could be used to run the target program and perform the mount/unmount operations. </p>

<p>the shell run by crom could perform all the CD's, etc</p>

<p>to have the application program be able to execute without being able to see its' libraries, perhaps link it 'static'.  perhaps have the users' .profile include the development of the $PATH variable to include the path(s) to the libraries.</p>

<p>the logon of the user could use a version of busybox that only has the commands the user needs to run the target program.</p>
