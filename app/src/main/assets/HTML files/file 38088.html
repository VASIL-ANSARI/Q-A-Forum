<p>The example gives field initializers on a controller. A controller instance is not synonymous with a "program"; a controller instance more commonly maps to a <em>single request</em> (although in the case of partials, it can actually be just a fragment of a request).</p>

<p>If you want to do something once and once only, a static field initializer may be useful; however, it is unclear what you would want to do in your scenario, as with anything <em>static</em>, the scores would be shared between <strong>all users</strong> - not usually what is wanted. Also: unless you understand concurrency in the context of your chosen framework (which from the question: you don't), <code>static</code> fields should usually be <code>readonly</code> and immutable.</p>

<p>A more appropriate solution in your case is probably per-client state; probably "session-state".</p>
