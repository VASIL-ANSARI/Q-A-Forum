<p>After 7 months I have a solution.  I have not tested this yet, because I still have to implement it.</p>

<p>The way I'm handling the snake body is by a list of rectangles defined by the top left X,Y coordinate, width, and height.  </p>

<p>What I can do is create a tree of degree 8 starting with the whole board, and then place each snake part into the tree, with the top left corner offset by the size of the apple.  When a part is placed, I can then split the board into 9 sections based on the 4 corners, 4 edges, and center of the snake.  Ignoring board parts containing the snake, and board parts with dimensions &lt;= 0, I can place these into the tree.  </p>

<p>Since the snake parts were already adjusted for the apple size, any point within a non-occupied leaf node can be used to place an apple </p>
