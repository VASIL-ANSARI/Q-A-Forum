<p>The key question is how the reports will be defined. </p>

<p>If reports are all custom code and you can reasonably set up a new custom index or map reduce query to get a simple table of data for the report then it may make sense to use NoSQL. </p>

<p>If you need reports to be defined or configured by end users you really have no reasonable option other than excel or a SQL based reporting tool.</p>

<p>You also need to consider how the dynamic columns will be used - schemaless stores work well for columns that only need to be displayed after you find a record, but not so well for queries. With SQL, all columns are queryable. A lot of NoSQL systems get their performance improvements by knowing that most columns will never be included in a query.</p>
