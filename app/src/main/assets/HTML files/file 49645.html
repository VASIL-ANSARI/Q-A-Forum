<p>If you haven't done so, make sure you're accessing SERVER_ADDR using the $_SERVER array to obtain the value of SERVER_ADDR, which is an element of this array.</p>

<pre><code>$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'];
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, it may mean that your server doesn't provide that information.</p>
