<p>You can easily achieve your desired results using value converters. They will allow you to modify any content displayed in your textbox before it is actually rendered. So if anybody would enter '1350am', you could do some string analysis and return '13:50 am' based on the input to the textbox. I assure you, it's way more easy than it sounds.
