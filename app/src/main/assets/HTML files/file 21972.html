<p>How often will the data be queried? On the one extreme, if once per day, you might use a sequential search more efficiently than maintaining a database or index.</p>

Most likely, it would be worth a negligible (if any) sacrifice in speed to use an SQL database (or other database, depending on your needs) in return for simpler and more maintainable code.</p>
