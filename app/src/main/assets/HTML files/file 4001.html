<p>You need the managed process to pass the pointer to <code>incoming</code> as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.intptr.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.IntPtr</a>.  This is the standard way to pass pointer values to unmanaged APIs.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IntPtr type can be used by
  languages that support pointers, and
  as a common means of referring to data
  between languages that do and do not
  support pointers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted this will fail on Win64 - you really need to change the <code>incoming</code> parameter to be of type <code>INT_PTR</code>.</p>
