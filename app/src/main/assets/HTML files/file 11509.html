<p>This is what I like to call a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/archive/2005/05/25/408925.aspx" rel="nofollow">"Shoe or Bottle?"</a> question. Do not go mixing Java and .NET, it <strong>can</strong> be done but <strong>there are better easier ways</strong> to do what you want to do. </p>

<p>Do one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write your entire project in a .NET language and use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.ports.serialport.aspx" rel="nofollow">SerialPort</a> class built in with .NET.</li>
<li>Write your entire project in java and use the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/products/products/javacomm/reference/api/javax/comm/SerialPort.html" rel="nofollow">SerialPort</a> class built in with java.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please do not try and mix and match the two, it is not worth the effort.</p>
