<p>Read the documentation for the SQL module, in particular the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/threads-modules.html#threads-and-the-sql-module" rel="nofollow">threads section</a> that states each connection can only be used within the thread that created it. </p>

<p>So adding a mutex is not good enough, you will have to either create a new connection object in each thread, or pass the required data to/from a dedicated thread that performs all DB queries.</p>
