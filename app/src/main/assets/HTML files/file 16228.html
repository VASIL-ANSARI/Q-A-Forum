<p>It's fine.</p>

<p>The execution order will be in the same order they were used.</p>

<p><strong>First in First Out</strong></p>

<p>jQuery has an internal queue called <code>readyList</code> storing all the callbacks for the ready event. When you call the <code>ready</code> function with a callback is simply add it to the queue and fire the whole queue when the DOM is ready.</p>

<p>Looking at the jQuery source code can tell you that easily:</p>

<p><strong>source code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>// The deferred used on DOM ready
readyList,
...
...

ready: function( fn ) {
    ...
    // Add the callback
    readyList.add( fn );

    return this;
}
</code></pre>
