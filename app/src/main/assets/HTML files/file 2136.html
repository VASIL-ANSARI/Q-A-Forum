<p>The fastest way to do that is comparing byte-to-byte of the files loaded on a stream. Hashing both files will take too long for large files, string compare too, external tools too.</p>

<p>Comparing byte-to-byte will be the best for you, as it will only reach the EOF of the files when both are identical.</p>

<p>If you do hash compare, string compare or external tools you'll have to go through the entire files all the times you compare, comparing byte-to-byte will do it only in case they're identical.</p>
