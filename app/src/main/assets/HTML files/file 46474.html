<p>You usually get the error <code>QProcess: Destroyed while process is still running</code> when the application closes and the process hadn't finished.</p>

<p>In your current code, your application ends at soon as it starts, because you didn't call <code>app.exec_()</code>. You should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    main = embeddedTerminal()
    main.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it works fine, but when you close the application you will still get the error message. You need to overwrite the close event to end the process properly. This works, given you replace <code>child</code> by <code>self.child</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def closeEvent(self,event):
    self.child.terminate()
    self.child.waitForFinished()
    event.accept()
</code></pre>
