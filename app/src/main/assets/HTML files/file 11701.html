<p>If your element's visibility is "" (meaning not set, which is its default value), you won't do anything with showHide. Which is probably why that approach didn't work. There's also a difference between turning an object invisible (which will still take up space in your layout) or hiding it (which will make it not take up any space).</p>

<p>What does this do?:</p>

<pre><code>$('foo').toggle();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$('foo').invoke('toggle');
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you're using an old jQuery library.</p>
