<p>I had the same problem, but after fighting with this long time, i didn't find a solution. I tested all the configurations with webview and did many different html changes to put the iframe.</p>

<p>After my researching i only can add:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Android 4 versions, can't autoplay. The user has to press play button into the iframe to start play the video. Particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Android 4.1 it reproduces the audio but not the image.</li>
<li>In Android 4.3 i tested in devices which can reproduce audio but no video and devices that can't reproduce anything.</li>
<li>In Android 4.4 don't reproduce anything</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>From Android 5 and + everything works fine. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck and I plus vote this question to know if anyone can put light into this question :)</p>
