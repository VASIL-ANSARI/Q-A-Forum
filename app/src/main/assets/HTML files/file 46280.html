<p>What you have created is a function closure and the variables in that closure will not be garbage collected until after the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback runs.</p>

<p>You can conceptually think of the local variables to a function as individual items that are garbage collected only when no other code that can still be called can reach those variables.  So, until your <code>setTimeout()</code> fires, the variable <code>am_i_eaten</code> is still reachable and will not be garbage collected.  </p>

<p>This works identically in the browser and in node.js (its literally the same V8 JS engine in Chrome and node.js).</p>
