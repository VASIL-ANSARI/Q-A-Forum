<p>It's not clear from your code, but I'm going to assume that you have a many-to-many here based on the <code>belongsTo</code> property.</p>

<p>I've managed to reproduce this with Grails 1.3.5. The problem only seems to affect the side of the relationship that has the <code>belongsTo</code> property. If you tried the same code with organization -> users instead, it would work.</p>

<p>The fix is rather odd: make the <code>users</code> collection on <code>Organization</code> non-lazy too.</p>

<p>This one will have to make it into the GORM Gotchas series!</p>
