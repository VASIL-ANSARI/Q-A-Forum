<p>Create a new exception type when you have something additional to say about the exception - something that is not covered by the existing exceptions.</p>

<p>If your application has some specific invariants and you need to communicate they are invalid - that may be a good place for a custom exception type. This allows you to catch exceptions that are specific to your application.</p>
