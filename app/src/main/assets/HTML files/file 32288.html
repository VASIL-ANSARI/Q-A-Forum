<p>If I understand your question properly you need to actually know what the SubcategoryId is for the bike you are referring to e.g.</p>

<pre><code>string selectedBike = "Mountain Bike";
var selectedBikeSubCategory = db.ProductSubcategories.FirstOrDefault(p =&gt; p.Name == selectedBike); // Assuming you have a name for sub categories
if (selectedBikeSubCategory != null)
{
    var allMountainBikes = db.Products.Where(p =&gt; p.ProductSubcategoryID == selectedBikeSubCategoryId.ID); // will give you all products matching the selected sub category bike type
}
</code></pre>
