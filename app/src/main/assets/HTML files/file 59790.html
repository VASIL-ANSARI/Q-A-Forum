<p>Can you tell the name of the package to which 'AuthorController' belongs ? I think issue is with <code>@ComponentScan(basePackages = "src")</code>. Here you should add package name of the controller classes.</p>

<pre><code>@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.sample.app") 

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.sample.*") 

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.*")
</code></pre>

<p>All the above are valid entries for ComponentScan annotation.</p>
