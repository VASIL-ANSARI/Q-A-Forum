<p>You could fetch the images asynchronously in the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method, that way the user does not have to wait and can immediately start interacting with the UI. As long as the images haven't loaded (i.e. images array size is 0) you could show a generic image. Once you are done fetching you  can update the tableview by calling the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableView_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UITableView/reloadData" rel="nofollow"><code>reloadData</code></a> method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For efficiency, the table view redisplays only those rows that are visible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the user starts scrolling in the tableview, any subsequent loaded cells will now be able to access the populated images array in the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> method.</p>
