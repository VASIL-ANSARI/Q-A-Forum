<pre><code>select room_types.id from room_types
    inner join rooms on rooms.room_type = room_types.id and rooms.available = 1
group by room_types.id
</code></pre>

<p>The concept is in there, but I can't write the query exactly since I do not know your schema. I do hope though that you learn what you need from this and apply it to your own schema.</p>

<pre><code>select room_types.id, COUNT(rooms.id) from room_types
    left outer join rooms on rooms.room_type = room_types.id and rooms.available = 1
group by room_types.id
order by COUNT(rooms.id) desc
</code></pre>

<p>With counting (including room types where there may to be available rooms).</p>
