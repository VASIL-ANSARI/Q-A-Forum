<p>Two things you should check:</p>

<p>1) does that particular user object indeed have a value in <code>picturePath</code>? You might want to check for existance of the property before accessing it:</p>

<pre><code>if(properties.Contains("picturePath") &amp;&amp; properties["picturePath"].Count &gt; 0)
{
   ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) If I remember correctly, to get access to custom attributes, you should explicitly refresh the cache for a user object before doing anything:</p>

<pre><code>DirectoryEntry de = ......;  // find / assign that DirectoryEntry somehow

de.RefreshCache();  // to load all properties from the directory
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>de.RefreshCache(new string[] { "picturePath" });  // to just load the "picturePath" attribute
</code></pre>

<p>Also: the classes in <code>System.DirectoryServices</code> are really mostly geared towards being used against Active Directory - there might be "surprises" or subtle incompatibilities when used against some other LDAP server - like OpenLDAP. </p>
