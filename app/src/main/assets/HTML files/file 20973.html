<p>I am guessing that (as other's have pointed out) you don't really want a cartesian on this update so I have added an "id" to the query so you will have to do some modification but this might get you on the right path</p>

<pre><code>;with temp as (
    select  a.id, SUM(a.pazartesi - b.kota) as newTotal
    from    [asgdb01].[dbo].[info] a join [asgdb01].[dbo].[kota] b 
          on a.id = b.id
    where   a.work_type='in' and a.name='alp' )
update  a
set     fm = t.newTotal
from    [asgdb01].[dbo].[info] a join temp t on a.id = t.id
</code></pre>
