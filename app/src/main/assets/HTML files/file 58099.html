<p>The first solution shouldn't put much load on the database if you have proper indexes i.e. a composite index <code>INDEX(txn_status, txn_time)</code> </p>

<p>If most of the rows in your table are not pending, queries like this should be very fast: <code>SELECT * FROM transaction WHERE txn_status = 'pending' AND txn_time &lt; NOW() - INTERVAL 30 MINUTE</code> as the number of non-pending rows shouldn't really affect the speed of the query at all.</p>
