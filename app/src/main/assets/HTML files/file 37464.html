<p>To your questions:</p>

<p>1) There isn't one that allows you to manually change the queue size, although something like a LinkedBlockingQueue will <em>grow</em> up to the max that you set for it.</p>

<p>2 and 3) You could do what you described (create a new ArrayBlockingQueue) using the 3rd constructor described in the docs:</p>

<p><strong>ArrayBlockingQueue(int capacity, boolean fair, Collection c)</strong></p>

<p><em>Creates an ArrayBlockingQueue with the given (fixed) capacity, the specified access policy and <strong>initially containing the elements of the given collection</strong>, added in traversal order of the collection's iterator.</em></p>

<p>This gives you the copy construction that you're looking for, and allows you to set the new capacity.  Sizing up:</p>

<pre><code>// create the first queue
Queue smallQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(5);

// copy small queue over to big queue
Queue bigQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(10, false, smallQueue);
</code></pre>

<p>Sizing down (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>Queue bigQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(10);
// start processing data with your producer / consumer.

// then...
Queue smallQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(1);
// 1) change producer to start doing puts into the smallQueue
// 2) let consumer continue consuming from the bigQueue until it is empty
// 3) change consumer to start polling from the smallQueue
</code></pre>

<p>Your puts from step 1 will block until you switch the consumer over.</p>
