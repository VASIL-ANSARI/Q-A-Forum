<p>You said "don't ask", but I've got to: <em>why</em> can't you control the order of the rows?  Aren't you the one writing the database query?</p>

<p>If you think fixing the order of the rows will help you parse and build a new data structure better, why not make sorting the rows the first step in your process?  Or, is the data set too large?</p>

<p>You might find some of PHP's array set manipulations to be of use.  i.e. <code>array_diff</code>, <code>array_intersect_key</code> etc.</p>
