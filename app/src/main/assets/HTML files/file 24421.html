<p>My guess is that whichever data source you are accessing via OLEDB does not support case statements.</p>

<p>The Linq query is being translated into SQL which includes a <code>WHEN</code> keyword (presumably as part of a <code>CASE</code> statement) but OLEDB can be used to wrap all kinds of data sources and not all of them will support such constructions.</p>

<p>If you are accessing a SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, or other major database system then you should use the appropriate ADO.NET provider for that system instead of OLEDB. If you're accessing some other data source, e.g. Excel, then you may be out of luck. If you can find out what SQL is being issued to the data source then that may provide more information for solving this problem.</p>
