<p>Because it is plain text and not image/ or application/ However it MIGHT HAVE to be application, but no-one uses it and IE will fail on it</p>

<p>Because text is what it used to be and some browsers will fail if we change it, you should keep text/javascript. Now since HTML5 it is dropped and since the default IS javascript, a lot of SO people advocate simply dropping it. This might give validation errors in some DOCTYPES</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
alert("UNLESS this is IE and there is a VBScript as the first script on the page,"+
  "this WILL be JavaScript in all known browsers");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is also a good reason not to use onclick="<strong>javascript:</strong> something()" unless you use some IDE and want to find your inline handlers quickly</p>
