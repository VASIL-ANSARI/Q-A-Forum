<p>My idea is to create a base form that handles CRUD operation ,and create some custom controls that have special property ,like fieldname ,fieldlength,caption,... showing a table in tree view that user can drag and drop field from treeview to design sheet can be good idea,
in save or delete or update operation you can read all related fields in form ,and affect proper operation on database</p>
