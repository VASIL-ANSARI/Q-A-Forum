<p>I understand that you want 2 windows to show on startup and be able to interact with each other.  No fancy threading code is needed.  </p>

<p>Open up your App.xaml file.  There is an attrbibute in there for "StartupUri".  Remove that - this is basically a shortcut for telling WPF to show a specific window when the app starts up... you can skip this and code in your own startup behavior.  To do so, next open up App.xaml.cs and insert something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>        Window1 window1 = new Window1();
        Window2 window2 = new Window2(window1);

        window1.Show();
        window2.Show();
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes of course that your window classes are named Window1 and Window2 and that you added a constructor to Window2 that takes an instance of Window1.</p>
