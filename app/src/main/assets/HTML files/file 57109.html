<p><code>mailto</code> supports attachment if the file is available locally. You can use the <code>attach</code> parameter to specify that. <br />
e.g. <code>mailto:lastname.firstname@xxx.com?subject=Test&amp;attach=C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\username\Desktop\foldername\file.extn</code> <br />
However, I'm unsure how you would use this in your code as users can download the file to any location on their machine. If it's of any use, the <code>attach</code> parameter supports shared drive locations if the user has appropriate access.</p>
