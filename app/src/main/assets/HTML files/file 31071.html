<p>No, you are off the mark. The answer is much simpler :-)</p>

<p>Simply write to stdout. Write any error messages to stderr, and for input, read from stdin. Those streams are setup to write to the console (unless the console has had its input/output redirected). Your program can then be used as a command useful for batch scripting. It will properly honor any redirection or pipe that is instantiated from the command line or batch script, with no further work required on your part.</p>
