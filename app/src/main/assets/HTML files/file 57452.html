<p>Yes. This is related to how the images are rendered.</p>

<p>When you have an image with colors, you usually have the complete information of the color of every pixel. So a 100x100 image renders perfectly on a 100x100 pizel size.</p>

<p>But when you try to scale <em>UP</em> this image, you have more pixels available to fill but less <em>information</em> about <em>how</em> to fill them. So you resort to mathematical algorithms, usually known as <strong>interpolation</strong>.</p>

<p>Canvas will automatically interpolate the pixels to fill in gaps using nearest pixel information.</p>

<p>To get your desired effect of having single pixels, you need to scale up <em>without</em> any interpolation. To do this you can refer to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7615009/disable-interpolation-when-scaling-a-canvas">answer</a>, or rather find several answers now that you know the appropriate terms to exactly describe your problem.</p>

<p>This CSS3 solution should work in Chrome 41+ for now: </p>

<pre><code>canvas {
    image-rendering: pixelated;
}
</code></pre>
