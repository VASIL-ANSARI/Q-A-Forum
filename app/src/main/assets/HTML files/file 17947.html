<p>The completion handler block should be invoked regardless of whether the save succeeded</p>

<p>About the completionHandler from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIDocument_Class/UIDocument/UIDocument.html" rel="nofollow">apple</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>completionHandler<br>
  A block with code that is executed when the save operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:<br>
  success<br>
  YES if the save operation succeeds, otherwise NO.<br>
  This block is invoked on the calling queue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you put a breakpoint on this line to make sure it runs</p>

<pre><code>[self.document saveToURL:self.document.fileURL forSaveOperation:UIDocumentSaveForCreating completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT<br>
I believe the issue can be which type of debugger you are using. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5949122/1015071">(from this SO question)</a><br>
Make sure you are using <code>lldb</code></p>

<p>Even if you don't change debuggers, you could always verify the block is executed with  <code>NSLog(@"block is running, save successfully - %d", success)</code> </p>
