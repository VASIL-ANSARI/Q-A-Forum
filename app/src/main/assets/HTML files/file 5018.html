<p>Are you trying to get the hinted type, or the actual type? I can't see why you could want to get the hinted type, as you <em>know</em> it is 'FooRepository' or PHP would have raised an error.</p>

<p>You can get the actual type via <a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class.php" rel="nofollow"><code>get_class</code></a> and you can also find out if a object inherits from a given class with <a href="http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/reflectionclass.issubclassof.php" rel="nofollow"><code>ReflectionClass::isSubclassOf</code></a>.</p>
