<p>I've developed a somewhat <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/tz6umu65/1/" rel="nofollow"><strong>working solution</strong></a> - it isn't perfect, but it will find the middle space and split there. That being said, a better solution might involve the total character count to find the space that is closest to the <em>true</em> center, or even perhaps getting the width of the entire line and setting the string's container CSS to half of that width. But being that I had nothing but time...</p>

<h1>Final Code</h1>

<pre><code>function nth_occurrence (string, char, nth) {
    var first_index = string.indexOf(char);
    var length_up_to_first_index = first_index + 1;

    if (nth == 1) {
        return first_index;
    } else {
        var string_after_first_occurrence = string.slice(length_up_to_first_index);
        var next_occurrence = nth_occurrence(string_after_first_occurrence, char, nth - 1);

        if (next_occurrence === -1) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return length_up_to_first_index + next_occurrence;  
        }
    }
}

function splitValue(value, index) {
    return value.substring(0, index) + "," + value.substring(index);
}

function evenBreak(myString) {
    var count = (myString.match(/ /g) || []).length; //How many spaces are there
    var middle = Math.ceil(count/2); //Find the middle one

    var middleIndex = nth_occurrence(myString, " ", middle); //Get the index of the middle one
    var splitString = splitValue(myString, middleIndex).split(","); //Split the string into two pieces at our middle

    myString = splitString[0] + "&lt;br&gt;" + splitString[1].substring(1); //Put it back together with a line break between

    return myString;
}

var str = evenBreak("This is our newly split string with a line break in the center!");
alert(str);

<h1>How we got there</h1>

<p>First, we need to find out how many spaces there are...</p>

<pre><code>var count = (temp.match(/ /g) || []).length;
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we know there are X spaces, the middle-most is found by doing...</p>

<pre><code>var middle = Math.ceil(count/2);
</code></pre>

<p>But how do we find WHERE in our string that middle space is? Here's something I grabbed from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12745196/2026606">another question</a> to do just that...</p>

<pre><code>function nth_occurrence (string, char, nth) {
    var first_index = string.indexOf(char);
    var length_up_to_first_index = first_index + 1;

    if (nth == 1) {
        return first_index;
    } else {
        var string_after_first_occurrence = string.slice(length_up_to_first_index);
        var next_occurrence = nth_occurrence(string_after_first_occurrence, char, nth - 1);

        if (next_occurrence === -1) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return length_up_to_first_index + next_occurrence;  
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so we know exactly where we want to place our line break. But we need a function to do this. I'll split the string there and put a line break between them, by using the following function...</p>

<pre><code>function splitValue(value, index) {
    return value.substring(0, index) + "," + value.substring(index);
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>This is only splitting <em>once</em>. It relies on just breaking the string in half, not multiple times.</li>
<li>The string will not be split perfectly if the character concentration is not somewhat uniform. It only counts <em>spaces</em> and does not factor in <em>total characters</em>. For example if you had the following sentence "He is a hilarious comedian", the difference in characters on either side of the center-most space is vast.</li>
</ul>
