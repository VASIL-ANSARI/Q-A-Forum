<p>You can check the application state by calling</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] applicationState]
</code></pre>

<p>In your case it should be <code>UIApplicationStateBackground</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you using a <code>NSURLSession</code> for your network requests, you can set it up with a background session configuration. When your app is in the background, this will allow networks requests to be handled by the system even when your app isn't running.</p>
