<p>The pros are simple --</p>

<ul>
<li>Your site is more likely to render in multiple browsers in a uniform manner if you follow standards, and your code will be more machine readable.</li>
<li>Browser specific hacks are sometimes fine, but beware that you may have to maintain them as later browsers come out that don't support them.</li>
<li>(from below:) If you don't use fully CSS compliant code, you'll have to remember which bits are intentionally non-compliant every time you verify your code through a CSS parser/verifier.</li>
<li>It will illustrate any obscure bugs you've most likely missed, which have effect on things you won't have tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing you can do is have a special stylesheet for specific browsers. For example, for IE specific code, you can use special IE-only <em>conditional comments</em> to include the CSS. Here's an example to show a sheet called <code>iestylesheet.css</code> for IE 6 only:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;link href="iestylesheet.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously, the most important reason to use compliant CSS is that without doing so, you don't get that nifty W3C CSS compliant icon to put on your site. :-)</p>
