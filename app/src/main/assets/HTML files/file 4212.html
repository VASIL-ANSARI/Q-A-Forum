<p>If a context menu is opened for a <code>ListView</code>, <code>menuInfo</code> will contain an object of type <code>AdapterContextMenuInfo</code>, which gives you information about which item in the list was clicked. If it is the first or the last item, you can simply remove the corresponding entries from the context menu, though I'm not quite sure what happens if no entries are left.</p>
