<p>Your problem is that <code>start</code> is a separate command whose purpose is to launch a completely new process unrelated to the <code>cmd</code> that invokes <code>start</code>.  Whatever <code>start</code> then executes is not connected to the original <code>cmd</code> and cannot be accessed by your Java program.</p>

<p>If you need to access the subprocess' in/out/err streams, do not use <code>start</code>.</p>
