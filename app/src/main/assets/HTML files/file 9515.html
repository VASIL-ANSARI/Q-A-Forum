<p>I've had similar problems with exceptions not being handled. It usually got solved by just handling the exception with one catch statement, don't ask me how but I'm sure there's a good reason behind this. Have you tried removing the <code>catch(IOException e)</code> and just keeping <code>catch(Exception e)</code>?</p>
