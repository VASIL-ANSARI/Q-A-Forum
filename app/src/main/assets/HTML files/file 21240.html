<p>If you don't mind your program exiting after any exception, you can probably use a global exception handler. You may have to put <code>throws Exception</code> (or a more specific exception class) at a whole bunch of places (to prevent unhandled-exception compile-time errors), which is very far from ideal (and could end up with less "pretty" code than catching exception where they are thrown).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you want your program to recover from errors (which is generally wanted in production-level code), you'll need appropriately placed try-catch statements (which could involve having try-catch statements everywhere in your code).</p>

<p>As example, if you get an IOException, you may want to retry, or if you get a NumberFormatException, you may want to notify the user that the input was invalid and let him/her try again.</p>

<p>You should not just remove try-catch statement, you should look at what they do, whether this behaviour is what you want and whether it will be reproducible with alternative solutions (e.g. a global try-catch statement).</p>
