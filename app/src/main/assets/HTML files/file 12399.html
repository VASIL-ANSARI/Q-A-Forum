<p>Two things are wrong here.</p>

<p>1) JSON keys are always string. Just because it is written without quotes doesn't make it a number. It just means the key name is "safe", i.e. doesn't contain spaces or other special characters.</p>

<p>2) JSON hash keys absolutely not guaranteed to be in any particular order. If you are expecting them to be, then your expectation is wrong. You should be serializing your data as an array of objects (or strings) instead of a single hash object.</p>

<p><code>["bernard@mail.com","aaron@mail.com"]</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>[{key:1,value:"bernard@mail.com"},{key:2, value:"aaron@mail.com"}]</code></p>

<p>Actually make that three things</p>

<p>3) The output you seeing has nothing to do with jQuery. That is just how <code>console.log()</code> serialized hash object you gave to it. Which is valid (see #2).</p>
