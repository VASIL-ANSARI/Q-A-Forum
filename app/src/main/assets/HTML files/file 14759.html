<p>The cast is always safe, dereferencing it is safe as long as the pointer is valid.
The only case where you'd use a <code>void **</code> is when you plan to dereference it to get a <code>void *</code>.</p>

<p>However, unless you do pointer arithmetics it won't really matter. As you can see on <a href="http://codepad.org/UcZUA0UL" rel="nofollow">http://codepad.org/UcZUA0UL</a> it works fine no matter if you use <code>void*</code> or <code>void **</code>. Before you actually use the pointer you are going to cast it back to <code>char **</code> anyway - so it is never dereferenced while it's <code>void</code>-ish.</p>
