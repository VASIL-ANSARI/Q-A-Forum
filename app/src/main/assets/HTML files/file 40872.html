<p>I found the problem that nginx with round-robin or least-connected load balancing, each subsequent clientâs request can be potentially distributed to a different server. so on my site after make first request for ex => <a href="http://ec2-54-148-96-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/site/index" rel="nofollow">http://ec2-54-148-96-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/site/index</a>
then make request <a href="http://ec2-54-148-96-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/assets/f352c4d6/css/bootstrap.css" rel="nofollow">http://ec2-54-148-96-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/assets/f352c4d6/css/bootstrap.css</a> it go to another server but for assets f352c4d6 not found on another server so return 404.</p>

<p>solution:
you must use ip_hash; with nginx load balancing to keep the same server for one ip
also you may be use leas_connect to distribute user to least server traffic.</p>
