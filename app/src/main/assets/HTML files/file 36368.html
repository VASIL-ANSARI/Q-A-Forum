<p>You need a custom reducer to track what values in the ID property you've seen before. You can do this yourself or you could use a library like <a href="https://github.com/esjewett/reductio" rel="nofollow">reductio</a>. There is an example of how to do this in the readme. I'm calling it "exception aggregation".</p>
