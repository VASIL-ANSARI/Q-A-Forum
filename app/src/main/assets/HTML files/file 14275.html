<p>You're sending the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> command to your network server, but it doesn't have any connection to the <code>local_db</code> database.</p>

<p>You must either export the data from your local database in some manner (probably best to use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/mysqldump.html" rel="nofollow"><code>mysqldump</code></a>, although you could also load it into PHP and then <code>INSERT</code> into your network database), or else look into MySQL <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/replication.html" rel="nofollow">replication</a> or <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/mysql-cluster.html" rel="nofollow">clustering</a> to keep the databases synchronised.</p>
