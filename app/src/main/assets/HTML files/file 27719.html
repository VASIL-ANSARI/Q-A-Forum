<p><code>onmouseover</code>, for example, is an event handler. When the event handler needs to be called (in this case when the browser javascript engine decides it) then it will call it be passing it some pre-determined arguments (all good documentation will explain what those arguments are). Your use of those arguments is optional however.</p>

<p>This can be demonstrated with a manual function call like so:</p>

<pre><code>function myFunction(e){
   alert(e.myProperty);
}

//assign the handler
var handler = myFunction;

//when required, create event parameter data and call the function assigned to the handler
var myE = { myProperty: "some data" };
handler(myE);
</code></pre>

<p>It is not "exactly" how it works (because I don't know how browsers have chosen to implement their code), but it shows the concept.</p>
