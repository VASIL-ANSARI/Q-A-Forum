<p>You can't pass a complex object that isn't <code>Serializable</code> or <code>Parcelable</code> between activities. One option would be to cache the images in your custom <code>Application</code> class, and access them from there in your activity.</p>

<pre><code>MyApplication application = (MyApplication)getAppliction();
Drawable drawable = application.getCachedDrawable();
</code></pre>
