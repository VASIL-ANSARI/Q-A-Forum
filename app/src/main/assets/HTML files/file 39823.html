<p>Functions that take the <code>out</code> parameter create new objects. This is usually what you would expect from the function: Give some array and get a new one with the transformed data.</p>

<p>However, imagine you want to call this function several thousand times in a row. Each function call will create a new array, which of course takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>In this case you may want to create an output array <code>out</code> and let the function fill the array with the output. After processing the data you can reuse <code>out</code> and let the function overwrite its values. This way you won't allocate or free any memory, which can save you a lot of time.</p>
