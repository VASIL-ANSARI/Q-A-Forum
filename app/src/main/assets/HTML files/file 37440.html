<p>This is possible, but generally people just use existing solutions that start a single master process and N server processes. Then when a server process dies or stops, it just starts a new one. One example is <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/pm2" rel="nofollow"><code>pm2</code></a>.</p>

<p>That said, your example sounds correct to me as long as you use the <code>detached: true</code> argument for <code>.spawn</code></p>
