<p>I never used laravel, but this is a general issue.</p>

<p>If you let the webserver handle the delivery of the image to the client, the php interpreter will not be started.</p>

<p>If you deliver something via PHP (I assume, because you write something about a cached image), you need the php interpreter. Then you need to execute the script, and all its logic, which is in a scripted language always slower, then in native.</p>

<p>Your best bet is, to save the image on the file system, and link to it, instead of a PHP script.</p>

<p>This means for example:</p>

<p>Somewhere in your Application you have a point, where the original image is created. Now think about, what versions of it you need. Resize, crop, edit it as much you want. Save each version you need in your file system. So you have instead of <code>image.jpg</code> a <code>image-200x200-cropped-with-branding.jpg</code>. At this point, performance shouldn't be so much important (The image will be viewed thousands times, but only one time created).</p>

<p>You want to have</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="/path/to/image-200x200-cropped-with-branding.jpg"&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="/image.php?param1=1&amp;param2=2"&gt;;
</code></pre>
