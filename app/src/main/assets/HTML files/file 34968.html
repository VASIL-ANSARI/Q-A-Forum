  <p>Can anyone tell me the way how to drag a image form gallery view and
  drop that in a grid view in android. Is that possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is possible. Use <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop.html" rel="nofollow">Android drag/drop framework</a> that will allow your users to move data from one View to another View in the current layout using a graphical drag and drop gesture. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/android/core/ui/drag-and-drop/android-drag-and-drop-example/" rel="nofollow">example</a> might help you.</p>

<p>Explanation :</p>

<p>When you drop the image to new location</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove that view form its parent (Galleryview in your case)</li>
<li>Add that view to your new Parent (GridView in your case)</li>
<li>Update the corresponding adapters with data.</li>
</ol>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>     case DragEvent.ACTION_DROP:
          ViewGroup oldParent = (ViewGroup) view.getParent();
          oldParent.removeView(view);
          GridView container = (GridView) layoutview;
          container.addView(view);
          view.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
          break;
</code></pre>
