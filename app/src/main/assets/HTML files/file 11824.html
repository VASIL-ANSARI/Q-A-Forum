<li><p>You can probably just recompile using the Office 2003 interop, although that's .NET 1.1 and (I think) only available through the Office 2003 installer - look for ".NET Automation Support" or similar under each application. I have seen problems using code built for .NET 1.1 in 2+, though, particularly constructors failing - but completely repeatably, so if it works then there's no problem.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the Excel COM object directly. The result should then work for Excel 7 and later. The function signatures are broadly the same, although you now need to cast all the enums into integers to pass into the functions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're just using Excel to create a simple spreadsheet (or a relatively simple one) you could skip Excel altogether and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151005/create-excel-xls-and-xlsx-file-from-c-sharp">use one of these libraries</a> to generate the spreadsheet instead.</p></li>
