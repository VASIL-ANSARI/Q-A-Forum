  <p>So what type of images do I have to use?</p>

<p>For any picture that is part of your user interface (i.e icons, logos, placeholders), use PNG. It's not even about transparency, it's about pixel perfect design.</p>

  <p>And if .png preferable than how to decrease size of each image without affecting resolution?</p>

<p>There are many PNG compressors out there. Here are a couple of easy web-based ones.</p>

</ul>

<p>You can also get PNGcrush as a standalone executable which lets you tweak compression options, and integrate it into your build system.</p>
