<p>Thank you for the arictle. 
I kinda solved half my problem.. If i use Aforge i can run them through a set of filters, in my case i increase contrast before i grayscale and binarize, and then run blob extraction on them, which allows me to chop up the picture. Now i have a clean set of character images that i will "only" have to match against comparitve ones.</p>
