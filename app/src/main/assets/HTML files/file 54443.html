<p>Right now you are getting location updates from your activity but when your phone goes to sleep your activity will be stopped and hence the updates will be stopped. </p>

<p>You need to use the <code>PendingIntent</code> version of the <code>requestLocationUpdates()</code> method. Check this <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderApi.html#requestLocationUpdates(com.google.android.gms.common.api.GoogleApiClient,%20com.google.android.gms.location.LocationRequest,%20android.app.PendingIntent)" rel="nofollow">link</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method is suited for the background use cases, more specifically for receiving location updates, even when the app has been killed by the system. </p>

<p>You'll have to make an <code>IntentService</code> or a <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> to keep getting the location updates.</p>
