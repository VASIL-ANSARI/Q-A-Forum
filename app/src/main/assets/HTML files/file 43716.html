<p>The best thing to do would be to figure out what input causes the function to crash, and fix the function so that it does not crash.  Since the function is doing string processing, this should be possible to do by feeding it lots of dummy/test data (or feeding it the "right" test data if it's a particular input that causes the crash).  You basically want to torture-test the function until you find out how to make it crash on demand; at that point you can start investigating exactly where and why it crashes, and once you understand that, the necessary changes to fix the crash will probably become obvious to you.</p>

<p>Running the program under valgrind might also point you to the bug.  </p>

<p>If for some reason you can't fix the bug, the other option is to spawn a child process and run the buggy code inside the child process.  That way if it crashes, only the child process is lost and not the parent.  (You can spawn the child process under most OS's by calling fork(); you'll need to come up with some way for the child process to communicate its results back to the parent process, of course).  (Note that doing it this way is a kludge and will likely not be very efficient, and could also introduce a security hole into your application if someone malicious who has the ability to send your program input can figure out how to manipulate the bug in order to take control of the child process -- so I don't recommend this approach!)</p>
