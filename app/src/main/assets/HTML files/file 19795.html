<p>Jaxl library currently doesn't support such callbacks. This is because when you call <code>$client-&gt;send_chat_msg()</code>, <a href="https://github.com/abhinavsingh/JAXL/blob/v3.x/xmpp/xmpp_stream.php" rel="nofollow">XMPPStream</a> queues <a href="https://github.com/abhinavsingh/JAXL/blob/v3.x/xmpp/xmpp_msg.php" rel="nofollow">XMPPMsg</a> object in the output buffer of underlying <a href="https://github.com/abhinavsingh/JAXL/blob/v3.x/core/jaxl_socket_client.php" rel="nofollow">JAXLSocketClient</a>. Output buffers are flushed as and when socket is ready for write.</p>

<p>Before queuing all <a href="https://github.com/abhinavsingh/JAXL/blob/v3.x/xmpp/xmpp_stanza.php" rel="nofollow">XMPPStanza</a>'s are serialised (<code>to_string()</code>) by <code>XMPPStream</code>, thus underlying <code>JAXLSocketClient</code> output buffers have no knowledge about which stanza is being flushed over the write ready socket. As a result no such callbacks are currently possible.</p>

<p>There are non-authoritative ways of performing check about delivery status of your message e.g. is the output buffer empty? But this is tricky and not a perfect solution.</p>

<p>Perfect way to implement such callbacks will be to maintain output buffers within the context of <code>XMPPStream</code>, which should then be notified about underlying socket write ready state, finally before flushing stanza's over the socket, <code>XMPPStream</code> can execute these callbacks. Unfortunately, this is not how the library is designed. Though, possibilities are that such callbacks might get supported in future version of the library.</p>
