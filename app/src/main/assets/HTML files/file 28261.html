<p>Does this card reader normally work with your computer? Perhaps a driver needs to be installed first? </p>

<p>On the other hand, have you listed an intent for the USB device manager:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED" /&gt;
&lt;/intent-filter&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It would be helpful if you posted the error message you get.</p>
