<p>That just sounds like your approach to the problem is wrong. Maybe you should rethink your data structure. Normally, an array is typed. You can't really decide to insert a different type in one cell.</p>

<p>If you really can't change the data structure, try inserting a single dimension array of strings in each cell with only 1 entry in them, which is the string that goes there normally, except for row 0, column 3, which already is an array.</p>
