<p>Add a table with dates in it (a dates lookup table), then:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DAYNAME(d.FullDate) DAY, COUNT(*) COUNT
FROM dates d
LEFT OUTER JOIN products p ON d.FullDate = DATE(p.dateadded) 
    AND p.site_url = 'mysite.com'
WHERE d.FullDate BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND CURDATE()    
GROUP BY d.FullDate
</code></pre>

<p>It takes a little bit of storage, yes, but it will make queries like this a lot easier.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can make a stored procedure that loops through dates between 7 days ago and today and returns one row for each.</p>
