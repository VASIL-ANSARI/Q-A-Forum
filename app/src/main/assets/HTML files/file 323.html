<p>Take a look at <a href="http://xmlpreprocess.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">XmlPreProcess</a>. We use it for producing different config files for our testing and live deployment packages. 
We execute it from a nant script as part of a continuous build but, since it's a console app, I see no reason why you coudn't add a call in your project's post-build event instead</p>
