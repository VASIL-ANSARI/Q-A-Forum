<p>Package Management requires cURL or PHP Sockets.</p>

<p>If you use cURL, make sure that the core/packages/ directory is writable by PHP.</p>

<p>To get cURL (and Package Manager) working on localhost with XAMPP, you may also have to modify your firewall and add an exception for the C:\xampp\php\ext\php_curl.dll file. <a href="http://bobsguides.com/errata-mtog.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
