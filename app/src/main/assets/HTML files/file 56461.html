  <p>Since websockets are not HTTP, why are http servers needed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The premise on which your question seems to be based is that <code>socket.io</code> is a websocket library, which it isn't.</p>

<p>It's a real time, bidirectional event-based communication library (blurb from homepage). One of the transports that it uses are websockets, but it also provides other transports (XHR/JSONP), not <em>just</em> as a fallback but also for situations where websockets aren't supported/required/wanted.</p>

<p>On top of the transport, it offers additional functionality like segmentation (namespaces, rooms), acknowledgements, broadcasts, etc.</p>

<p>Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a <code>socket.io</code> server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through <code>/socket.io/socket.io.js</code>.</p>

<p>That said, although you don't <em>need</em> an HTTP server to regular websockets, there's no denying that the websocket protocol was designed with HTTP in mind (as to allow HTTP and websocket servers to co-exist on the same TCP port).</p>
