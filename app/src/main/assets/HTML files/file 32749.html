<p>Declare a private variable and Add a constructor to the class in Session.php</p>

<pre><code>private $database;

public function __construct($database) {
    $this-&gt;database = $database;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have your Session object instantiated, you will be able to access the database object in your Session object's methods by doing</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;database-&gt;do_something();
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest adding type hinting to the constructor but since I don't know what object type the $database is supposed to be I am leaving it off. You can read more about type hinting here: </p>
