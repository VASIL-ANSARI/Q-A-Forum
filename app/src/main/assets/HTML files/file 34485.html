<p>You haven't specified what <code>angle</code> represents when the snake is turning. It could be trivial to calculate the new angle just using old one, but here is a way using the tangent:</p>

<pre><code>vectorX = posX - middleX;
vectorY = posY - middleY;
tangentX = -vectorY; // flip the signs of these two for
tangentY = +vectorX; // turning in the other direction
angle = atan2(tangentY, tangentX)
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative way is to keep the meaning of <code>angle</code> as the snake's direction and forget about the centre of the circle and the tangent. When the snake turns, <code>1 / radius</code> is added or subtracted from <code>angle</code> and the position is still calculated using <code>posX += cos(angle), posY += sin(angle)</code>.</p>
