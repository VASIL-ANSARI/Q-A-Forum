<p>I would say you messed up class definition with function stuff. It should look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 20
        self.b = 30

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_instance = Test()
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>from class1 import Test

class Test2(Test):

    def e(self):
        print self.a
        print self.b


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_instance = Test2()
    test_instance.e() # prints 20 and 30
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like your problem is not (only) inheritance, but also <strong>how to correctly <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html">define classes in Python</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always use capitalized names for classes. That is more or less convention.</li>
<li>As ruibm pointed out, every (non-static) method of a class has to have a first parameter that is named (by convention) <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>You can create instance variables by setting them as <code>self.variable = value</code> in the <code>__init__</code> method.</li>
<li>If you call <code>Test()</code> you get an object back. Unless you assign it to a variable, just calling <code>test2()</code> as you did in your second piece of code has no effect. Maybe it had in your case because defined your class in a weird way.</li>
</ul>
