<p>Matrices can't be assigned to in C, they can only be initialized or their individual components can be assigned.</p>

<p>There are several ways that you could proceed here, the simplest would
perhaps not be a <code>switch</code> but an array of <code>Mat3</code></p>

<pre><code>static Mat3 const matrix[] = {
 {{1.0,0.0,0.0}, {0.0,1.0,0.0}, {0.0,0.0,1.0}},
 {{0.0,-1.0,0.0}, {1.0,0.0,0.0}, {0.0,0.0,1.0}},
 {{-1.0,0.0,0.0}, {0.0,-1.0,0.0}, {0.0,0.0,1.0}},
 {{0.0,1.0,0.0}, {-1.0,0.0,0.0}, {0.0,0.0,1.0}},
};

unsigned choice = ((unsigned)(theta/90))%4u;
matMult(p, matrix[choice]);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>I added <code>const</code> because it looks that this second parameter to your
function is read-only.</li>
<li><code>static</code> has it allocated and initialized only once before real
execution of the code.</li>
<li><code>unsigned</code> for the <code>choice</code> value guarantees the arithmetic with <code>%</code> really results in values from <code>0</code> to <code>3</code>, and not in something negative.</li>
</ul>
