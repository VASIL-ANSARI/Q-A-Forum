<p>How do you envision that the compiler would know that you're not doing <code>new TheClass()</code> from some other class?</p>

<p>Besides, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.8.9" rel="nofollow">JLS 8.8.9</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor with no formal parameters and no throws clause is implicitly declared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The compiler is <em>required</em> to do so.</p>
