<p>Above constant will be used by S2 to server the static content from inside the jar and than S2 will write the header to tell the browser to cache the content so that for subsequent request browser need not to fetch the content from the server.This is a standard way to speed up a website and it has nothing to do with browser back button.</p>

<p>When you log-out the user make sure that you invalidate the session.what you are facing is the cached copy of the browser.</p>

<p>When you requesting a copy of page browser checking if the same is with its cache and if yes, in place of requesting the server its serving the content from its cache.Just click on any link which required user to be logged in and you will see that link is not working since in that case browser is requesting the server for the content.</p>

<p>If you want to control this,you can set the cache control headers to request browser not to cache your content something like</p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
response.setHeader("Expires", "0");
</code></pre>
