<p>I also have encountered this error. The thing to note is that</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>the error is apparently absurd</strong> (it seems to say that "1", which is an integer, is an incorrect integer value), and</li>
<li>it happens on <strong>the very first column of the very first row</strong> and <strong>only there</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these two conditions hold, then in all probability the culprit is a hidden three-byte sequence which is smack at the beginning of the SQL file you're trying to load (it's called an <em>UTF8 Byte-Order Mark</em>).</p>

<p>In some cases the sequence is escaped in the error message and is shown recognizably, for example <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4960" rel="nofollow">in this bug report</a>. In other cases it is sent to the user as part of a value:</p>

<pre><code>Incorrect integer value: '###1'  ...
</code></pre>

<p>but the terminal "eats" the BOM and what you see is the (now absurd) error</p>

<pre><code>Incorrect integer value: '1' ...
</code></pre>

<p>To solve the problem, you need to open the file to be imported in some editor capable of removing the byte order mark (e.g. Notepad++).</p>
