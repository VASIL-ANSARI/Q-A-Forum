<p>I would suggest you to prepare two addresses in new action, add them to the use and then in the form reneder it with foreach.</p>

<p>I found this kind of solution here : <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-fields_for" rel="nofollow">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-fields_for</a></p>

<p>Since you have multiple addresses I think foreach is way to go. </p>
