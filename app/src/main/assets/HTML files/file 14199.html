<p>You can rotate (and scale) your Textures as you draw them to the buffer using <code>SpriteBatch.Draw</code>, although you will need to specify most (or all) of the arguments. Angles are given in radians.</p>

<pre><code>SpriteBatch.Begin();
angle = (float)Math.PI / 2.0f;  // 90 degrees
scale = 1.0f;
SpriteBatch.Draw(myTexture, sourceRect, destRect, Color.White, angle,
                 position, scale, SpriteEffects.None, 0.0f);
SpriteBatch.End();
</code></pre>

<p>You could also load pre-rotated copies of the images, but you'll probably get the usual Premature Optimization lecture.</p>
