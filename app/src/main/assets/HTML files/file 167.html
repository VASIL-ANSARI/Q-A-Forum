<p>First, do you really want to ignore errors? If you get an error, it is likely that the data is not in sync any more. Perhaps what you want is to drop the slave database and restart the sync process when you get an error.</p>

<p>Second, I think the error you are getting is not when you replicate an item that does not exist (what would that mean anyway?) - it looks like you are replicating an item that already exists in the slave database.</p>

<p>I suspect the problem mainly arises from not starting at a clean data copy. It seems that the master has been copied to the slave; then replication has been turned off (or failed); and then it has started up again, but without giving the slave the chance to catch up with what it missed.</p>

<p>If you ever have a time when the master can be closed for write access long enough to clone the database and import it into the slave, this might get the problems to go away.</p>
