<p>There isn't any built in support for shadows on <code>Sprites</code> in Cocos2D-X.</p>

<p>The best option, performance-wise, would be to place your shadows in your sprite images already, instead of calculating and drawing them in the code.</p>

<p>Another option is to sub-class <code>Sprite</code> and override the <code>draw</code> method so that you duplicate the sprite and apply your effects and draw it below the original.</p>

<p>One possible way to achieve that is with this snippet from <a href="http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/shadow-sprites/1214/2" rel="nofollow">this thread on the Cocos forum</a>. I can't say that I completely follow what this code does with the GL transforms, but you can use this as a starting point to experiment.</p>

<pre><code>void CMySprite::draw()
{
  // is_shadow is true if this sprite is to be considered like a shadow sprite, false otherwise.@
  if (is_shadow)
  {
    ccBlendFunc blend;
    // Change the default blending factors to this one.
    blend.src = GL_SRC_ALPHA;
    blend.dst = GL_ONE;
    setBlendFunc( blend );
    // Change the blending equation to thi in order to subtract from the values already written in the frame buffer
    // the ones of the sprite.
    glBlendEquationOES(GL_FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT_OES);
  }

  CCSprite::draw();

  if (is_shadow)
  {
     // The default blending function of cocos2d-x is GL_FUNC_ADD.
    glBlendEquationOES(GL_FUNC_ADD_OES);        
  }
}
</code></pre>
