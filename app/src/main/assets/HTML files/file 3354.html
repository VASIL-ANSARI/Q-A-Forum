<p>If that's the case I would add the association into the other factory:</p>

<pre><code>Factory.define :video do |v|
  v.filename                        {Sham.filename}
  v.video_url                       {Sham.url}
  v.audition                        {|v| v.association(:audition)}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can do</p>

<pre><code>v = Factory(:video) # This will now have an audition
a = v.audition # This should not be nil
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>a = Factory(:audition) # An audition without a video, if that's possible?
</code></pre>

<p>You can also override any association as needed when you create the factory in your tests, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>v = Factory(:video, :audition =&gt; Factory(:audition))
v = Factory(:video, :audition =&gt; nil)
</code></pre>

<p>Hope what I've said makes sense and is true lol. Let us know how you get on.</p>
