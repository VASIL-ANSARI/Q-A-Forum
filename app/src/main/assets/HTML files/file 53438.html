<p>Did you insert a fact of class SeniorClass into working memory?</p>

<p>Are you sure that setStudentPassCount wasn't called with a value of &lt;= 0?</p>

<p>Are there any other rules with lock-on-active set to true in your rule base? <strong>I strongly suggest that you do not use this attribute unless there is no other way.</strong></p>

<p>Are you sure that your rules are syntactically correct so that the rule base contains this rule (and others)? </p>

<p>Did you call fireAllRules? (Did you observe that other rules fire?)</p>

<p>Why do you use contradicting rule attribute values for <code>dialect</code>? <strong>Stick to one of them.</strong></p>
