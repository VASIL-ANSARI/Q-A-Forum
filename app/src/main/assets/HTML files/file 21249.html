<p>It is best to call <code>commit()</code> either right after you've made the changes, or in the <code>onPause()</code> method. This ensures that your changes are saved in pretty much every scenario, except uncaught exceptions that crash your app.</p>

<p>Also, you should note that neither <code>onStop()</code> or <code>onDestroy()</code> are guaranteed to be called at all, particularly in situations when Android is low on memory. However, <code>onPause()</code> is almost always called.</p>
