<p>The Sonar hint advises you to make a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9743513/defensive-copy-from-effective-java">defensive copy</a> of the given array. Generally speaking, you should follow that advise, because otherwise, your code could produce bugs, which are caused by unwanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">side-effects</a> and therefor hard to localize.</p>

<p>Usually, the performance impact by defensive copying is neglectible, due to it's unnoticeable overhead. More important for the decision pro/against defensive copy is its influence on other aspects of code quality, such as readibility, usability and stability.</p>

<p>As long as <code>sample()</code> is called infrequently, you don't need to hesitate making array copies.</p>
