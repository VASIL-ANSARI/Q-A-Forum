<p>Welcome to SO.</p>

<p>You are making a common design mistake.</p>

<p>Don't try to manipulate the second view controller's views directly. That's bad design, and often doesn't work.</p>

<p>Instead add a property/properties to your Face2 class.</p>

<p>In this case, a <code>backgroundColor</code> property is probably all you need.</p>

<p>Set that property in your <code>next</code> function, and then in your Face2 class's viewDidLoad method, use the color to set the background color of whatever views need to use the custom color. If you decide later that the set of views that need to change color is different, you can change the code for your Face2 class and the first view controller doesn't need to change at all.</p>

<p>You also need to get rid of vc2. That makes no sense. You create a new Face2 view controller <code>vc</code> with a call to <code>instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier</code>. That's the one you should be configuring. The one you create in vc2 is never used for anything. It will get deallocated as soon as you exit the <code>next()</code> function.</p>
