  <p>my question is: How to get the html of iframe(I found exist question can't fix my question)</p>

<p>If the exist question said "you can't do that", then the exist answer is correct</p>

<p>However, if the site you wish to read has CORS set, then you could read the raw html (not from the iframe though)</p>

<p>There is a possibility by using a browser add-on, but I'm guessing you don't want to do this too obviously, i.e. instruct visitors to your site to download and install a browser add on</p>
