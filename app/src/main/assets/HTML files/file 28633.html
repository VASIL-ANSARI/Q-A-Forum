<p>The only reference I could find is in the <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/prog-manual.html" rel="nofollow">Sawfish WM programming manual</a>, which says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two special modifiers: the Any prefix matches any set of
  modifiers; the Release modifier matches key-release events instead of
  the default key-presses.</p>
