<p>You are not accounting for the case where there is no selection.</p>

<pre><code>public void setDetails()
{
    Customer selected = (Customer) customerCombo.getSelectedItem();
    if (selected != null)
    {
        // there is a selection so use it
    }
    else
    {
        // for example, clear the text boxes
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would also expect that changing the contents of the combo box might change its selection so we shouldn't ignore it.</p>
