<p>In general, to "add" two strings (where you're really trying to find the sum of two numbers):</p>

<ol>
<li>Convert your two strings to numbers.</li>
<li>Add the numbers.</li>
<li>Convert the sum to a string.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty straightforward; but feel free to ask if you have any further questions.</p>
