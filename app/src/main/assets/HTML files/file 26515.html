<p>Follow these Steps in <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/articles/javase-deploy.html" rel="nofollow">LINK</a> and other system will need JRE to run.</p>

<p>I think you are missing <code>swing-layout-1.0.jar</code></p>

<p>To add the Swing Layout Extensions library:</p>

<p>Right-click the project's Libraries node and choose Add Library.</p>

<p>In the Add Library dialog box, select Swing Extensions Layout and click Add Library.</p>

<p>Click OK to close the Project Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>Additional to doing what Shiv suggested, I followed <a href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/403965/java/java/Netbeans-Experts" rel="nofollow">link</a> , and it clicked to me as what was i doing wrong.</p>
