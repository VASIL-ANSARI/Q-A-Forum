<p>You need to expand the macro into your source code before you can debug it. You can either do it manually or make Visual Studio generate preprocessor output. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8z9z0bx6(v=vs.80).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8z9z0bx6(v=vs.80).aspx</a> describes the process for VS 2005. You will then have to create a new "debug" project with sources replaced with .i files generated by Visual Studio's preprocessor. This is a pain for any nontrivial project so I would try doing it manually first, especially since you identified the specific macro that causes exception, so you can try and manually expand just that one. You can also use those preprocessor-generated .i files for cross-reference.

UPD: If the macro in question is used in several locations, you may want to find out which location is responsible for exception. Run it under debugger (I assume you have full debug info generated, if not, you should) and check call stack at the time of exception. Expand just that location.

Be warned: certain projects in open source community are notorious for using macros as code obfuscation tools (I guess to keep their trade secrets from being discovered by reverse engineering) so good luck...</p>
