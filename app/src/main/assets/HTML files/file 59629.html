<p>I run your code and realized that your code goes into <em>infinite loop</em>, which let does your programm do nothing.</p>

<p>In the main method, <code>sort0123(arr, arr_size);</code> is called and within this method,         <code>while (mid &lt;= hi)</code>, mid = 6 and hi = 9 and that means <code>6 &lt;= 9</code> and because of this resaon, this condition returns true infinitely because of the fact that it goes always to the case 3 at some point and in the case 3, the values of mid and hi are not changed.</p>

<p>In order to be able to run your code, you should change the value(s) of <code>mid</code> and/or <code>hi</code> logically and with it, your program can behave, how you wanted. </p>
