<p>Use an Emulator with an older Version.</p>

<p>The android level in project properties is the one which the app is build with. But in Manifest you can specifiy a minSDKVersion - that is the minimal Version for which your App will be available in Play store.<br>
But with adb it is no problem to install it on devices or emulators which are not compatible to your current settings.</p>
