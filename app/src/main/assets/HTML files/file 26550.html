<p>If I understand you want to prevent going offline when they are offline...</p>

<p>If you are using PHP's curl bindings, you can check the error code using curl_getinfo as such:</p>

<pre><code>$handle = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($handle,  CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE);

/* Get the HTML or whatever is linked in $url. */
$response = curl_exec($handle);

/* Check for 404 (file not found). */
$httpCode = curl_getinfo($handle, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
if($httpCode == 404) {
    /* Handle 404 here. */
}

curl_close($handle);

/* Handle $response here. */
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can check for other error codes, as 500, 503, etc.</p>
