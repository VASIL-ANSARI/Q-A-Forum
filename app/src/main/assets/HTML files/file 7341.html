<p>There are several problems here.</p>

<ol>
<li>You should use double underscore when checking for 'main'. I.e. <code>__main__ == "__main__"</code>.</li>
<li>You are <em>not</em> collecting bytes but rather always storing the <em>last</em> byte read. Therefore, the last byte is always <code>""</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, it seems like indentation is not correct. I assume this is just a stackoverflow formatting error.</li>
<li>One more potential issue - When you use fwrite(fid, A) in MATLAB, it assumes that you want to write bytes (8 bit numbers). However, your <code>rand()</code> command generates reals, so MATLAB first rounds the results to integers and your binary file will hold '0' or '1' only.</li>
</ol>

<p>Final note: Reading a file one byte at a time is probably very inefficient. It is probably better to read the file in large chunks, or - if it is a small file - read the entire file in one <code>read()</code> operation.</p>

<p>The corrected Python code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
   f = open("xxx.bin", "rb")   # Trying to open the bin file

   try:
     a = [];
     byte = f.read(1)       # Reading the bin file and saving it in the byte array
     while byte != "":
       a.append(byte);
       # Do stuff with byte.
       byte = f.read(1)

   finally:
       f.close()

   print a;
</code></pre>
