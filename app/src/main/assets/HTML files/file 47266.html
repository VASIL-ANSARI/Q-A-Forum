<p>There's no need for all that complicated code.</p>

<pre><code>current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()
schedule = datetime.time(10, 00, 00)
current_time == schedule
</code></pre>

<p>Although that will only be true on the exact microsecond of 10:00:00, which is almost certainly not what you want. Do you perhaps want to check that it is in the hour of ten o'clock? That would be even simpler:</p>

<pre><code>datetime.datetime.now().hour == 10
</code></pre>
