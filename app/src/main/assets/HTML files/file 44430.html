<p>A simple hand-rolled approach is to, for each "indexed" column, put all the rows into a <code>HashMap&lt;ColumnType, HashSet&lt;Row&gt;&gt;</code>, so that each distinct key value maps to a list of all rows having that key value in that column. A query can be executed by getting all the <code>HashSet&lt;Row&gt;</code> for the key values in the query, and taking their intersection.</p>

<p>The expected time complexity for this will be <em>O(km)</em>, where <em>k</em> is the number of keys in the query and <em>m</em> is the maximal number of hits from any key column.</p>
