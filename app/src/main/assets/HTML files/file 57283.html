<p>JS is completely dynamically typed, so when you have the line</p>

<pre><code>popoverOptionsModule._stopAskingList = 4;
</code></pre>

<p>You've just created this variable and assigned it a value, hence why the next line succeeds.  If you didn't have this line, then the subsequent console.log would report undefined.  This code would work too</p>

<pre><code>popoverOptionsModule._abc = 4;
console.log(popoverOptionsModule._abc);
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that this isn't actually a private variable in the same way that OO languages implement protection levels, rather it's just an API pattern that attempts to hide it from the caller.</p>
