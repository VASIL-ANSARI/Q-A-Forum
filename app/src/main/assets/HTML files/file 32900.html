<p>Firstly, you need to have a read up on mysql escaping / best practices. Your script here is vulnerable to SQL injection. 
There are plenty of good resources online, or search <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%20SQL%20injection%20PHP">SQL injection PHP</a> on here, to help explain this to you if unsure.</p>

<p>How is the <code>$_POST['admin']</code> value set, can you post an example of your form here?
I'm guessing that the value being sent in isn't matching your conditions above so this is likely to be the cause. </p>

<p>It could be as simple as changing your if statement to be <code>===</code> rather than <code>==</code>, but to be sure I'd need to see your form's source core. </p>
