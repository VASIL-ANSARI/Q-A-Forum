<p>If you are using AutoCommit => 0, then you don't need begin_work(). Everything is in a transaction until you commit() or rollback(). Then a new transaction begins.</p>

<p>Actually, you should connect with RaiseError => 1, because you should get an error on begin_work() when AutoCommit is 0. From the fine docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If AutoCommit is already off when
  begin_work is called then it does
  nothing except return an error. If the
  driver does not support transactions
  then when begin_work attempts to set
  AutoCommit off the driver will trigger
  a fatal error.</p>

<p>Also, what version of DBD::mysql are you using? I think the latest version does implement AutoCommit.</p>
