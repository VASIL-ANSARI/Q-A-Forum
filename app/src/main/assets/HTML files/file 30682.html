<p>My suggestion is to tell the junit runner where the base directory of the XML files is. You can configure the "work directory" for junit runner to be Catalina base:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're running junit tests in an IDE, for example Eclipse. Check the configuration tabs for Junit, you'll find where to configure the work directory.</li>
<li><p>If you're running junit tests in command line. you can do it as this:</p>

<p>$cd /path/to/Catalina/base</p>

<p>$ (invoke junit runner)</p></li>
</ul>
