<p>Since this library exposes global <code>SunCalc</code> object with bunch of methods, what you can do is simply wrap this lib into custom service.</p>

<pre><code>app.factory('SunCalc', function() {
    return window.SunCalc;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could use it like this in controller:</p>

<pre><code>app.controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, SunCalc) {
    $scope.position = SunCalc.getTimes(new Date(), 52.3667, 4.9000);
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you can event add your own methods to this service without messing with original library.</p>

<p>Note, that technically you could use globally accessible <code>SunCalc</code> without creating one more service for this. However using services offers sertain advantages: you can rename it easily, it allows to facade original library API, using global variables error-prone, etc.</p>

<p>Also remember to include script tag before Angular script tag.</p>
