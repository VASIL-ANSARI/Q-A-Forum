<p><code>find_all</code> style methods return an array of matching records. That is an empty array if no matching records are found. And an empty is <em>truthy</em>. Which means:</p>

<pre><code>arr = []
if arr
  puts 'arr is considered turthy!' # this line will execute
end
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the dynamic finder methods (like <code>find_by_whatever</code>) are <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html#active-record-deprecations" rel="nofollow">officially depreacted</a> So you shouldn't be using them.</p>

<p>You probably want something more like:</p>

<pre><code>@event_object = @event_entry.event_objects.where(plantype: 'dog').first || EventObject.new
</code></pre>

<p>But you can also configure the event object better, since you obviously want it to belong to <code>@event_entry</code>.</p>

<pre><code>@event_object = @event_entry.event_objects.where(plantype: 'dog').first
@event_object ||= @event_entry.event_objects.build(plantype: dog)
</code></pre>

<p>In this last example, we try to find an existing object by getting an array of matching records and asking for the first item. If there are no items, <code>@event_object</code> will be <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Then we use the <code>||=</code> operator that says "assign the value on the right if this is currently set to a falsy value". And <code>nil</code> is falsy.  So if it's <code>nil</code> we can build the object form the association it should belong to. And we can preset it's attributes while we are at it.</p>
