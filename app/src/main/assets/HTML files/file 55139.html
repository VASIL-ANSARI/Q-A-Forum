<p>The <code>sort</code> method is working on the actual input parameter that is passed to the method by call-by-reference (I know this is not 100% correct in terms of wording - see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value">here</a>). That is, all changes to the array <code>h</code> in <code>sort</code>are visible in the calling code as well.</p>

<p>If you don't want to change the input parameter, you need to make a copy of the object. In your case you could use <code>System.arrayCopy</code> to do so.</p>
