<p>I am not sure this will perfectly solve the problem of keyboard and alertView appearing simultaneously. But I would recommend you to use the newer api. I am posting this as an answer as its difficult to put code into comments.</p>

<p>For some reasons <code>UIAlertView</code> has been deprecated in iOS 8. Instead of using the <code>UIAlertView</code> you should use the <code>UIAlertController</code> with style <code>UIAlertControllerStyleAlert</code>. Present it and then open keyboard.</p>

<pre><code>UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:yourTitle message:yourMessage preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];

[self presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Since the alert now is shown as <code>UIViewController</code> the keyboard won't shift the alert box upside. </p>
