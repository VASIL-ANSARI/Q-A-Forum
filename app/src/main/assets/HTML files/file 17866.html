<p>If you want to link to one particular version at compile time (as you sample suggests) - you need to have 2 projects that will include different versions of Interop assembly and refer to the same set of source files.</p>

<p>If you want to do it at run-time and use strongly typed objects you'd need to wrap methods that are interesting to you and expose them through your custom classes/interfaces because interop assemblies do not share any base classes (siblings instead of 11 is parent of 12 as you may wish).</p>
