<p><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/index.html" rel="nofollow">log4j</a> is the de facto standard (with the standard <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/logging/" rel="nofollow">Java logging framework</a> a close second).</p>

<p>You should use Version 1.2.x for production use.</p>

<p>You can configure log4j via code (at runtime) or via a configuration file (either Java properties or XML format).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The target of the log output can be a file, an OutputStream, a java.io.Writer, a remote log4j server, a remote Unix Syslog daemon, or many other output targets.</p>

<p>There is a SMTPAppender that can be configured for sending mails with log entries on specific conditions, in case eMail is what you meant by "sent to me".</p>
