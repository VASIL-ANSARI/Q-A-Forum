<p>There are 3 issues I see right away. First, you are calling your flex function using </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>postXMLPageRequest(variables, <strong>request.toString()</strong>, '_blank');</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though it extends Object, URLRequest doesn't actually have a toString() method. request.url is the correct way to get the url string.</p>

<p>The second is that you have a syntax error in your javascript. You have a double quote and a single quote rather than a pair of quotes in </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>hiddenField.setAttribute("name", "' + xmlString);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Third, you indicate in your call to the flex method that you want to do a GET request. You never actually pass a method type string into the javascript though. If you want the do a get you need to pass "GET" as the fourth parameter of the ExternalInterface call. Otherwise it will default to POST.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
