<p>I'm not familiar with Arduino, but in C++ you have to <code>#include &lt;ctime&gt;</code>. It's possible that in the C++ implementation where clock_t worked for you ctime was included indirectly via another header whereas Arduino's implementation of that other header did not include ctime. </p>

<p>This is an issue with C++; the headers included in other standard headers are not defined by the standard, so different implementation may produce different results when you fail to directly include the correct headers simply because each implementation uses different indirect includes. To avoid this you should be careful to always directly include any standard header that you use anything from. This means you need to be knowledgeable about which standard headers provide which standard facilities. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/" rel="nofollow">http://en.cppreference.com/w/</a> can help you.</p>
