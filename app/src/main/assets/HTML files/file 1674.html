<p>As far as I know, a gem cannot define tasks or capistrano recipes directly, but may be used within tasks and recipes.</p>

<p>If you need something that is a gem and still has rake tasks and recipes, you may want to look at the approach used by HAML. When you install the gem, you still need to install a plug-in, even though the "plugin" is simply a hook to load the gem.</p>
