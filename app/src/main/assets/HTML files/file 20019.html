<p>If we're talking about uber 2.0, then I would say it's pretty easy. The top part that slides behind the map, with profiles and etc, is just a navigation controller, that doesn't take the whole screen. And you don't have to keep that background controller in memory all the time, just an image of it inside CALayer, and put that layer below your navigation controller.</p>
