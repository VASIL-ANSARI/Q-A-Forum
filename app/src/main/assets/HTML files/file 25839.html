<p>I believe you mean <code>/Applications</code> instead of <code>/root/Applications</code> since there is no such folder (at least not on my iOS 5 device).</p>

<p>Since <code>/Applications</code> folder has is owned by <code>root</code> with <code>755</code> permissions. That means, non-root users can read/execute the files in that folder but not write to it. If you want to write to that folder, you need to run your app as <code>root</code>. The way to do this, somewhat ironically for you, is to have the app installed in <code>/Applications</code> folder. (I think) this is automatically done if you install the app through <code>Cydia</code>.</p>

<p>So to sum up: You can't move app to <code>/Applications</code> if you installed it through App Store (or ad hoc distribution). You need to install it through <code>Cydia</code> and it'll be installed directly in that folder.</p>

<p>Also, that answer you're referring to in comments, is about Mac OS, not iOS.</p>
