<p>Try doing:</p>

<pre><code>this.picPreview.Image = Image.FromFile(imagePath);
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of messing around with <code>FileStream</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you don't have to set <code>this.picPreview.Image</code> to <code>null</code> after disposing it.
When you call dispose, it releases all resources regardless to whether you have a pointer to it or not.</p>

<p>Setting null to something, or in other and more accurate words, losing any reference (pointer) to an object - will cause the GC (Garbage Collector) to release it's resources.</p>

<p>Using the Dispose method will allow the GC to release it even though you still have a reference to it. (Thanks Rowland Shaw), so simply re-setting it to <code>Image.FromFile(imagePath)</code> will work just fine.</p>

<p>The reference to the previous image will be lost and the GC will dispose it when it feels like it (won't be long, I promise).</p>

<p>So to sum it up, I would suggest replacing the WHOLE piece of code with the single line in the beginning of this answer.</p>
