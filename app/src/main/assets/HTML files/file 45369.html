<p>The MySQL-Python project does not support Python 3âsee <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/" rel="nofollow">the project web page</a>, which has said "Python 3 support coming soon" for years now, and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5" rel="nofollow">the cheese shop entry</a>, which offers only a Python 2.7 version and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python-3.0 will be supported in a future release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no "-py3.2" distribution available that I've heard of (or could find by searching); your host may have something silly (like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15859504/2359271">this</a>, for example) to get the library to install on Python 3, but being able to install a library does not guarantee it will actually work.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/1046062" rel="nofollow">an example of someone running into the same problem on a shared host</a>:</p>

  <p>Today i switched to Python v3.2.3 on my remote web server at

<p>You're right about the <code>%s</code> syntax being correct for the library; unfortunately, something about it isn't playing nice with Python 3. You could try using the named parameter style instead, and see if that gets you anywhere, but the best thing would be to stop using an unsupported library altogether. If your host also provides <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-versions.html" rel="nofollow">an old version of Connector/Python</a>, for example.</p>
