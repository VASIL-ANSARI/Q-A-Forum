<p>not that I know gtk, but a quick google, it seems, the board you are getting in your callback isn't actually a board you are passing.  Your callback signature for the clicked event is incorrect</p>

<p>it should look a little like </p>

<pre><code>void button_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
</code></pre>
