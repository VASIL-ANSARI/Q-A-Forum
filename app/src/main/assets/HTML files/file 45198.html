<p>Edit:  Good catch @Tom, I just added a modification to the answer that should take care of the <code>!= 6</code> case.</p>

<p>You need to access the <code>menu()</code> function through the <code>Enroll</code> class like this:</p>

<pre><code>choiceentry = Enroll.menu();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that your only method <code>menu()</code> in the <code>Enroll</code> class is static, so you don't need to create an instance of the <code>Enroll</code> class.</p>

<p>This line:</p>

<pre><code>choiceentry = scanchoice.nextInt();
</code></pre>

<p>Should be this in order to use the <code>Scanner</code> reference:</p>

<pre><code>choiceentry = input.nextInt();
</code></pre>

<p>One more thing, it looks like you want the user to be able to enter multiple commands until they choose to quit.  Take a look at the use of the <code>hasAnswered</code> flag in the code below.</p>

<p>Code with changes:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Student
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

        int choiceentry;
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        choiceentry = Enroll.menu(); //Access through the Enroll class
        if(choiceentry == 6)
        {
             //Exit if user entered 6
             System.exit(0);
        }

          while (true) //I hate to put while(true) in code, but it seems appropriate here
          {
                boolean hasAnswered = false; //use a flag to determine if the user entered a valid command
                if(choiceentry == 1) 
                {
                  hasAnswered = true;
                // ..do something
                }
                else if(choiceentry == 2)
                { 
                  hasAnswered = true;
                //..something else
                }
                else if(choiceentry == 3)
                {
                  hasAnswered = true;
                //...something else
                }
                else if(choiceentry == 4)
                {
                  hasAnswered = true;
                // ..something else
                }
                else if(choiceentry == 5)
                {
                  hasAnswered = true;
                //..something else
                }
                else
                {
                  System.out.println("Enter \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\" or \"6\"");
                  choiceentry = input.nextInt(); //use the Scanner

                  if(choiceentry == 6)
                  {
                     //Exit if user entered 6
                     System.exit(0);
                  }
                }

                if (hasAnswered == true){
                    hasAnswered == false;
                    //user had issued a valid command, prompt for the next command
                    choiceentry = Enroll.menu(); //Access through the Enroll class
                    if(choiceentry == 6)
                    {
                       //Exit if user entered 6
                       System.exit(0);
                     }
                }
        }
