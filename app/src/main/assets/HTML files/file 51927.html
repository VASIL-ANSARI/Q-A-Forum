<p>On KeyDown event of TextBox you can find which key was pressed by user with e.Key like this,</p>

<pre><code>    private void txtName_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Key == Key.Enter)// Key.Escape, Key.Return
        {
            //What is your need..................
        }
    }
</code></pre>
