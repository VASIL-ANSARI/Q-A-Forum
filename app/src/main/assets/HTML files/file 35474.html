<p>I suspect that it has to do with recycling and termination of process after some idle time. 
Every application on IIS runs under some AppPool. I have checked my settings on DefaultAppPool (win 8.1) and these are below.</p>

<p>I know that you write that you have IIS idle time set to 0 on server. But have you checked right App Pool? And is it this value that I have shown on the first screenshot?</p>

<p>I would also check if after some time some w3p process (responsible for your WCF app and run under your set AppPool identity) cease to exist on the server. Also, I would try to self host the WCF service to check if it is a problem with IIS or somewhere else.</p>
