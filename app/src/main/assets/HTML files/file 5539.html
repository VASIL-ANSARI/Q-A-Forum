<p>From my comment:</p>

<p>Well the wording gets changed in one direction only, so it'll never return to "Read More". Other than that, it would be nice to see the HTML that accompanies this.</p>

<p>Here is some code that might work, pending seeing the HTML.</p>

<pre><code>$('#more').click(function() {
    $('#the_more').slideToggle("slow", function () {
        $('#more').text(function (index, text) {
            return (text == 'Read More' ? 'Read Less' : 'Read More');
        });
    });

    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Demo: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/yLvms/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/yLvms/</a></p>

<p>The code works as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>A click event is bound to the <code>#more</code> element, when clicked the function fires.</li>
<li>When fired, <code>#the_more</code> element is slid up or down, toggled, depending on it's visibility state.</li>
<li>A callback is fired after the <code>slideToggle()</code> is finished that changes the text</li>
<li>The text within <code>#the_more</code> is changed using the functional variant of the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/text/#text2" rel="nofollow">.text()</a> function, this passes the current text value to the function for changing.</li>
<li>The text function is simply a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F%3a" rel="nofollow">ternary-if</a> that checks the current value of the text within <code>#the_more</code> and if it is currently 'Read More' it becomes 'Read Less' and vice versa, a toggle of the text.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
