<p>Ever since TFS has been released, you can only create a new team project with the version that is at least the same as the TFS server. In your case you'll need to be running Visual Studio 2015.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx" rel="nofollow">Community Edition</a> will be enough, I haven't installed an express edition in ages, but I suspect that even <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx" rel="nofollow">Visual studio 2015 express for Desktop</a> will do the trick.</p>
