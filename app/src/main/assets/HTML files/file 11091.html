<h2>Compile-Time Image Compositing</h2>

<p>If your logo doesn't need to change other than the version number, then you can use your graphics library of choice at compile-time to refactor the png.  Pseudo code below:</p>

<h3>Pseudo-Code:</h3>

<pre><code>UpdateLogo(String logoName, String version)
{
    WidgetImage MyLogo(logoName + ".png");
    MyLogo.DrawText(800, 650, version);
    MyLogo.Write(logoName + "Final.png");
}

UpdateLogo("Logo.png", "Version 1.0.0");
</code></pre>

<p>Compile that program and keep it around as a custom build tool.  Then whenever you need to build your application you can compile Logo.png into LogoFinal.png.  If you need help using XCode or other tools to generate image files I suggest you search for image manipulation tools separately from "dynamic versioning".</p>

<p>Ideally your version string will use constants defined in an easily-editable table or controlled by your build system.  At the very least it will save you from opening up Photoshop every time you need to build your app.</p>

<h2>For Display in a Running Application</h2>

<p>You should be using a font to draw the version number on top of the logo.  Then you can just include a resource file that is text-based and can be easily updated by automated tools for each build.</p>
