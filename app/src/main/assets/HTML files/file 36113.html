<p>You can do it out with AOP Advises,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In
  terms of programming, they are methods that gets executed when a
  certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the
  application. You can think of Advices as Struts2 interceptors or
  Servlet Filters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can configure an advice to take care of validation . you can also configure them to execute at a particular point (i.e) where it needs to be executed .</p>

<p>But remember scope of AOP remains only for method invocation and it doesn't provide response as servlet filters does.</p>
