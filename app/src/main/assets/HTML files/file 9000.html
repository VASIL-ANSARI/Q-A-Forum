<p>I'm not sure what the question about the white border/red circle is about but here is a good direction to delete a tableRow after long-clicking on it.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, ContextMenuInfo menuInfo){
    TableLayout yourTable = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.yourTableId);
    TableRow yourTableRow = yourTable.getChildAt(INDEX_OF_YOUR_ROW_IN_THE_TABLE);
    if(v.getId() == yourTableRow.getId()){
        yourTable.removeView(yourTableRow);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should work if you know the index of the row you're trying to click on and your TableRow has an ID.</p>
