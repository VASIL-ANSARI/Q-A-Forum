<p>I would use a <code>std::array&lt;signed char, 64&gt;</code> and access it as <code>a[8 * i + j]</code>*. No point going into sub-byte granularity, since those 64B will probably be in the same cache line anyway and you get quick access like that. You could even try an array of <code>int</code>s for comparison; it might be that word-sized access is even faster. Only profiling can tell.</p>

<p>*) Or even <code>std::array&lt;std::array&lt;char&gt;, 8&gt;, 8&gt;</code>, as rightly commented. Same thing, essentially, though perhaps even easier to use.</p>
