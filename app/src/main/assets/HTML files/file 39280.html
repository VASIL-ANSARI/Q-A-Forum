<p>It is possible that somewhere in your object graph, List&lt;{object}> needs to be serialized.</p>

<p>DataContractSerializer sees List&lt;{object}> as being different than List&lt;{any other type}> so typeof(List&lt;{object}>) must be one of the Type's passed on to the DataContractSerializer constructor.</p>

<p>Try that and see if it helps.</p>
