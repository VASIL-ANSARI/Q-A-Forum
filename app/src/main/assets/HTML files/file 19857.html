<p>On iOS, you can use our modal views to display a PDF - I've put together a little demo app here to show that: <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/forge-spikes/tree/master/pdf-reader" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/goodgravy/forge-spikes/tree/master/pdf-reader</a></p>

<p>Note that this wouldn't work on Android because the webview doesn't include a PDF reader.</p>
