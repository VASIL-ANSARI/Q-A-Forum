<p>Phalcon should load classes correctly even if the class name is a variable. Try isolating the problem down to just:</p>

<pre><code>$myClass='VarEducation';
$partner_obj = new $myClass();
</code></pre>

<p>Also try commenting out that particular model from your model list and see if your other models work, perhaps there's an error in finding that particular model but not others. Check your <code>/app/config/loader.php</code> file and make sure you're registering your models directory. Then make sure the file <code>VarEducation.php</code> exists in your models directory as well as your other models. Also make sure that the class name inside the file matches the file name, and you've named the class <code>VarEducation</code>. Also make sure it's not namespaced. Also make sure you didn't forget the leading <code>&lt;?php</code> and that the file doesn't have any errors. If all else fails, you can simply load the class from your loader.php file with something like:  </p>

<pre><code>$loader-&gt;registerClasses(array(
    'VarEducation' =&gt; $config-&gt;application-&gt;modelsDir.'/VarEducation.php'
));
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure a simple test for the model works: <code>$x=new VarEducation();</code> I suggest doing this from your index controller under a <code>test</code> action.  If none of this works, comment on this post with your results when trying my suggestions and I'll update my answer.</p>
