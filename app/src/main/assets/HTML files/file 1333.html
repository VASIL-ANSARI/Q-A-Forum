<p>Firstly, you can't (AFAIK) declare a variable outside a class.</p>

<p>For your first example, I think you mean:</p>

<pre><code>public Class B 
{
   A declareClassA = new A();
   // methods here..
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for your question - do you need to use the same instance in both MethodA and MethodB, or not?</p>

<p>If you do, use the above code. If not, use a separate declaration in each method.</p>
