<p>Given that it only happens sometimes, and the fact that you are seeing errors - even once the first part works - that say <code>Unknown host</code>, I suspect the lines before <code>Error:Cause: peer not authenticated</code> (if you check them) are letting you know a connection timed out, there was a "could not resolve" on some auth domain it was trying to reach, a "could not GET", etc... basically a network problem, possibly related to your network speed but also could be just a problem with your DNS server. </p>

<p>What DNS server are you reaching, and can you try to ping it? If it sometimes responds slow, or if you can show a failed ping to your DNS server during a timeframe when these bugs are occurring, you have found the source of the problem.</p>
