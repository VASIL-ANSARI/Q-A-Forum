<p>I fixed the problem by myself.
Indeed, the mistake was inside the headers.</p>

<p>I thought Content-Range and Content-Length was supposed to work like this:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Range: bytes startbytes-totalbytes/bytestobesend
Content-Length: bytestobesent
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, it works like this:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Range: bytes startbytes-totalbytes/totalbytes
Content-Length: totalbytes
</code></pre>

<p>(Where totalbytes is the complete filesize, not only the chapter that is sent)</p>
