<p>If you're trying to get arguments from the command line, <code>main</code> doesn't need a parameter, and you don't need to call <code>input</code>. You're merely overwriting <code>sys.argv</code> when you do that.</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv

def main(): 

    script, first, second, third = argv
    print ("The script is called:", script)
    print ("Your first variable is:", first)
    print ("Your second variable is:", second)
    print ("Your third variable is:", third)

main()
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\kevin\programs&gt;py -3 test.py hurf durf klurf
The script is called: test.py
Your first variable is: hurf
Your second variable is: durf
Your third variable is: klurf
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, if you really <em>do</em> want to get information from <code>input</code>, and you just got confused reading about argv, then you can use <code>split</code> to get words from the input string rather than letters. Of course, you can't get the script's name this way.</p>

<pre><code>def main(data): 

    script, first, second, third = data.split()
    print ("The script is called:", script)
    print ("Your first variable is:", first)
    print ("Your second variable is:", second)
    print ("Your third variable is:", third)

main(input("Enter some data: "))
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>Enter some data: hello how are you?
The script is called: hello
Your first variable is: how
Your second variable is: are
Your third variable is: you?
</code></pre>
