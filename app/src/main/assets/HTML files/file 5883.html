<p>Every time the Pictures collection changes, you're calling RedrawPictures. That adds all of the pictures again, but doesn't clear anything... so you'll be trying to add a control to <code>panelPicturesWrapper.Controls</code> when it already contains that control. That sounds like a bad idea to me.</p>

<p>Further, you're iterating over the <code>Controls</code> collection while changing it, which is generally a bad idea.</p>

<p>I suggest you change your removal code to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void DeleteSelectedImages()
{
    var picturesToRemove = panelPicturesWrapper.Controls
                                               .Cast&lt;SelectablePicture&gt;();
                                               .Where(p =&gt; p.IsSelected())
                                               .ToList();

    foreach (var picture in picturesToRemove)
    {
        RemovePicture(picture);
    }
}
</code></pre>
