<p>I am using Syndication as well and i am able to get published date and title.</p>

<p>My code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>URL feedUrl = new URL("http://www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/podcast/cat_markets.xml");

SyndFeedInput input = new SyndFeedInput();
SyndFeed feed = input.build(new XmlReader(feedUrl));

for (Iterator i = feed.getEntries().iterator(); i.hasNext();)
{
SyndEntry entry = (SyndEntry) i.next();
System.out.println("title |"+entry.getTitle()+"   " -timeStamp "+entry.getPublishedDate()"\n")
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works , and i have used Bloomberg Url just cause it gives me a XML.</p>

<p>If your query was something else , do let me know :) </p>
