<p>I don't know why you want to do this as personally i would do; </p>

<pre><code>User::on('draft')-&gt;all();
</code></pre>

<p>As this explains the code within the code. Following does not without having to explore your code.</p>

<p>But if you want you could try adding this method to your model; </p>

<pre><code>public static function draft(){
    $instance = new static;
    $instance-&gt;setConnection('draft');
    return $instance-&gt;newQuery();
}
</code></pre>

<p>So then you can do <code>User::draft()-&gt;all()</code>. </p>

<p>Personally, I would use the <code>on</code> method, but the second has not been tested.</p>

<p>EDIT: after looking setConnection is not a static method. So the on method is the way to go.</p>
