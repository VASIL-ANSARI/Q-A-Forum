<p>Instead of setting the frame of your background view you might want to do something like</p>

<pre><code>UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:cell.contentView.bounds];
view.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
</code></pre>

<p>This answer assumes you're not using auto-layout since you're setting the frame of your background view. If you're using auto-layout you don't want to be setting the frame at all and instead setting constraints on your background view.</p>
