<p>According to your ideas - you should also consider using WordPress core code to fetch the XML data.</p>

<p>Create a plugin which will load XML data using <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/HTTP_API" rel="nofollow">HTTP API</a> and call proper actions on your blog (in this case IFTTT will be unnecessary for publishing blog posts based on the XML data).</p>

<p>The only issue which you can have is a fact that you will need an access to the server cron - as <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_cron" rel="nofollow">wp_cron</a> by default is called only during the users visits - so on the website with a small traffic it won't work as you can expect (it won't be called as often as you need).</p>
