<p>I've never used Quartz, but in Java you can use a thread pool with an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ExecutorService</code></a>. There are different executor services so you will need look at documentation and see which ones meets your needs. (Perhaps try <code>newFixedThreadPool(int)</code>)</p>
