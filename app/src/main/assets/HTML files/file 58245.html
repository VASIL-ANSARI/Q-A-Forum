<p>If an <code>Allergy</code> is meant to have a "set" of symptoms, then you want some sort of <code>Symptom</code> array in your <code>Allergy</code> class. Also just to make sure that variable names are linked to their classes (so you know what you're editing), the <code>name</code> in <code>Allergy</code> should be named <code>allergyName</code> since there are multiple "name" variables across the program:</p>

<pre><code>class Allergy {
    String allergyName; 
    List reporter; 
    Set&lt;Symptom&gt; symptoms; 
    Date timeReported; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: A <code>Set&lt;&gt;</code> (thanks, Mshnik) is used rather than an array, as I worded it above, because this type of data structure is dynamic and can allow for any number of symptoms. Using an array, just limits you to a fixed number of them. Also a <code>Set&lt;&gt;</code> only accepts unique entries, which makes sense for your program because having 2 of the same <code>Symptom</code> for an <code>Allergy</code> doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Also, can a <code>Clinician</code> have more than one <code>Patient</code>? If so, you might want another <code>Set&lt;&gt;</code> in your <code>Clinician</code> class to account for this. But a vanilla array might suffice if you want to keep a certain <code>Clinician:Patient</code> ratio.</p>

<p>I can't see anything else that I would change at such an early stage.</p>
