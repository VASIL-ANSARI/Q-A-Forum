<p>It turned out to be frustratingly simple to fix this, I changed the timing for slide transitions from 0.5 seconds to 1 second and the bug has gone. Still not 100% sure why but I think the functions takes longer when animating previous slides compared to next slides and so needed a bit more time to catch up with itself to avoid falling over.</p>
