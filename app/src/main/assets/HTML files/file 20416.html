<p>Your code is effectively interpreted like this:</p>

<pre><code>var a; // Variable declarations are hoisted to top of scope
var b;
var c;
var d;

b = 1;
c = 2;
d = a || b;
</code></pre>

<p>So the final <code>c</code> declaration is doing nothing at all. Note that <code>var x = y, z;</code> is simply a <em>variable statement</em> that contains two declarations (one of which includes an assignment).</p>
