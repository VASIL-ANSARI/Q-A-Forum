<p>CipherOutputStream tends to swallow exceptions generated by the Cipher and OutputStream objects it wraps. The Sun RSA implementation will not encrypt more than than M-11 bytes, where M is the length in bytes of the modulus. This is true for the default PKCS1Padding, which is what you should always use unless you really know what you are doing. You can specify NoPadding and thereby get the full M bytes.</p>

<p>RSA is not the correct choice for encrypting bulk data. The generally accepted method for encrypting data with RSA is to generate a random symmetric session key <code>K</code>. e.g. an AES key, encrypt the data with the symmetric algorithm with <code>K</code>, then encrypt K using the RSA keys of all the receipients.</p>
