<p>If you're going to store pointers to anything in your map, you'll have to manually go through the map and delete each one. Normally in a class  you'd stick to RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization) and construct things in the <em>constructor</em> and destroy in the <em>destructor</em></p>

<pre><code> for (;;)
     delete map-&gt;second; //it's not an array of lists 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>However a pointer to a container is NOT a good idea</strong>.  Why do you do need a pointer? What problem are you trying to solve using a pointer to a <code>list</code>?</p>

<p>Using a smart pointer like <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is a much better idea than raw pointers. Raw pointers should be a last resort, not the first thing you grab when you can't think of anything better.</p>
