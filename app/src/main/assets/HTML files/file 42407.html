<p>You can try creating Batch script which can build environment for mstest and trigger the test accordingly</p>

<p>please find below example. you just need to replace correct path for <strong>vcvarsall.bat</strong> for your system</p>

<pre><code>cd\
cd "Program Files &lt;x86&gt;"\"Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0"\VC
call "vcvarsall.bat"
cd\
C:
Mstest /testcontainer:Test.dll /resultsfile:result.trx
</code></pre>
