<p>Search engines visit sites almost like a user, by which I mean a page is prepared by the server and sent to them. PHP is whats running on your server to create that page, including setting the title to the value of the variable. So what the search engine get is the output of your PHP with the variable replaced with the value.</p>

<p>So no, using PHP will not effect your SEO.  </p>
