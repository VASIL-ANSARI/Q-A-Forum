<p><strong>Whenever a cell is in edit mode, its hosted control is receiving the <code>KeyDown</code> event instead of the parent <code>DataGridView</code> that contains it.</strong> That's why your keyboard shortcut is working whenever a cell is not in edit mode (even if it is selected), because your <code>DataGridView</code> control itself receives the <code>KeyDown</code> event. However, when you are in edit mode, the edit control contained by the cell is receiving the event, and nothing happens because it doesn't have your custom handler routine attached to it.</p>

<p>I have spent way too much time tweaking the standard <code>DataGridView</code> control to handle edit commits the way I want it to, and I found that <strong>the easiest way to get around this phenomenon is by subclassing the existing <code>DataGridView</code> control and overriding its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.processcmdkey.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ProcessCmdKey</code> function</a></strong>. Whatever custom code that you put in here will run whenever a key is pressed on top of the <code>DataGridView</code>, regardless of whether or not it is in edit mode.</p>

<p>For example, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyDataGridView : System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView
{
    protected override bool ProcessCmdKey(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message msg, System.Windows.Forms.Keys keyData)
    {

        MessageBox.Show("Key Press Detected");

        if ((keyData == (Keys.Alt | Keys.S)))
        {
            //Save data
        }

        return base.ProcessCmdKey(ref msg, keyData);
    }
}
</code></pre>
