<p>Recently I had the same problem .
The latest freetypefont builds are using a newer version of the libgdx that have some huge changes .The addition of the id field in the Glyph class is one of them. All you have to do is update all the libgdx jars in your project to the newer ones.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/releases/libgdx-0.9.9.zip" rel="nofollow">the link for the latest build</a></p>

<p>Probably you will have to do some changes in your code too cause alot have changed to the libgdx lately</p>
