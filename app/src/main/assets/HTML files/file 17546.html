<p>This is normal behavior. <code>uwsgi</code> will not re-read your code unless you restart it (it does not work like <code>runserver</code> when you have <code>DEBUG=True</code>).</p>

<p>If after you have updated your code, restarted uwsgi, cleared your browser cache and it <em>still</em> doesn't reflect your changes, then you should delete <code>*.pyc</code> files from your source directory.</p>

<p>I typically use this:</p>

<pre><code>find . -name "*.pyc" -exec rm {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>Roughly speaking, <code>.pyc</code> is the "compiled" version of your code. Python will load this optimized version if it doesn't detect a change in the source. If you delete these files; then it will re-read your source files.</p>
