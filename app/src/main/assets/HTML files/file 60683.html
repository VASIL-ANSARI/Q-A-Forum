<p>Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change your table model to use an ArrayList as its data nucleus, not an inflexible 2D array.</li>
<li>The generic type of the ArrayList should be a class that holds the data of a single row of your JTable.</li>
<li>It should have an empty default state that signifies a row devoid of data.</li>
<li>When data is changed in your table model's methods, check the last row of the model to see if the object held by the list here is default or holds data. </li>
<li>If it holds data, add a new object to the list and call the appropriate fireXxx notification method.</li>
<li>In setValue, you can check the rowCount, and you can compare it with the row parameter passed into the method. If they match, then add a new row. But you have to be careful of circular references if you do this, since adding the new row will likely call setValue as well, and so you'll have to have logic present to prevent a stackoverflow.
