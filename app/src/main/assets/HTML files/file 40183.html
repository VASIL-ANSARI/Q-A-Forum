<p>Yes, a <code>HashSet</code> is not a boolean and cannot be converted to a boolean, and the regular for loop expects a boolean expression in the middle section (the section that determines when the loop terminates). </p>

<p>If you want to iterate over all the values in the set, you can use the enhanced for loop :</p>

<pre><code>for (Room room : occupiedRooms)
{
    if(room.getRoomNo().equals(roomNo))
        return room;
    getGuest();
    return "room " + roomNo + " is not occupied" ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how much sense your for loop makes, though, as it would always return something after the first<code>room</code> is tested, so the remaining rooms won't be checked.</p>
