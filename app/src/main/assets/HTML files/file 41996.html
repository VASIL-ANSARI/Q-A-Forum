<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.radview.com/" rel="nofollow">WebLOAD</a> to test a similar application (AngularJS front-end that communicates with the back-end using web-services).</p>

<p>When recording the scenario, the script will contain retrieving the static resources (like you've already done) but will also contain the dynamic http requests which go to the back-end (NodeJS in your app).</p>

<p>Although the JavaScript code is actually executed, the requests that affect the server are recorded and performed. </p>

<p>From the server's point of view, that's all that matters. The server doesn't 'know' (or care) about what the client is doing - it does not affect it's work-load so it's not important to simulate in load-testing. Using a full (or headless) browser (like, say, Selenium) is usually an overkill in load-testing - it doesn't scale well, require a lot of resources and therefore not efficient.</p>
