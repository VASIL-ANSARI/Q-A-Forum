<p>Well it's fixed what I wanted and I think it came down to the adapter failing. Now I'm aware my adapter does not have a ViewHolder but it has a limit amount of options so it's ok for now. </p>

<p>First I needed a class that allowed a CheckableLinearLayout. This is a special type of LinearLayout that allows sections of the layout to be checked and unchecked. You simply make a new class of it and then add it to your XML file as the rootview. com.YOUR-IDENTIFIER-CLASS-NAME-OF-CHECKABLELINEARLAYOUT :) You can see it in the link below!</p>

<h2>Checkable Linear Layout - Found here - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/8426774/4502550">How do a custom listview item with a radiobutton and single choice</a></h2>

<p>After using that class I made a different adapter that was much simplier and it just seemed to work. </p>

<h2>Adapter</h2>

<pre><code>public class AudioFormatAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt; {

private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; formats;

public AudioFormatAdapter(Context c){
    super(c, 0);
}


public AudioFormatAdapter(Context c, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; choices){
    super(c, 0, choices);
    formats = choices;
}

@Override
public View getView(final int position, final View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View listItemView = convertView;

    listItemView = LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_view_formats_layout, parent, false);

    CheckedTextView _radioButton = (CheckedTextView) listItemView.findViewById(R.id.format_radio_button);
    _radioButton.setText(formats.get(position));

    return listItemView;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see this adapter gets a "CheckedTextView" instead of the radio button. The reason for this is that I simply needed a radio button style with some text and this gives me that. </p>

<p>I set the text with an arrayList that I pass to the adapter in "formats"</p>

<p>Finally I create the Dialog and get a reference to my list view. </p>

<h2>Dialog Creation with custom layout</h2>

<pre><code>private void showFormatChangeDialog(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; formatNames) {
    LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(SettingsActivity.this);
    View dialogLayout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.change_audio_format_dialog, null);
    AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(SettingsActivity.this);
    builder.setView(dialogLayout);

    final ListView formatListView = (ListView) dialogLayout.findViewById(R.id.format_choices_list_view);
    formatListView.setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE);
    final AudioFormatAdapter adapter = new AudioFormatAdapter(SettingsActivity.this, formatNames);
    formatListView.setAdapter(adapter);

    AlertDialog customDialog = builder.create();
    customDialog.show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want one of the options selected then set the mode to SINGLE_CHOICE. I make the adapter here and pass in a list of strings which are accepted as a parameter to my function. Then the dialog is created</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a rather irritating process as I think my adapter was breaking most things, I hope my trolling around the Internet and finding out bits and pieces can help someone else. Now I just need to save and store data depending on which option is selected!</p>

<p>I hope this helps somebody! </p>
