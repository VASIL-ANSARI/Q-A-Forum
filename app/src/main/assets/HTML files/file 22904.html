<p>Because rails is looking for the user_id saved in your database to access the record. so you need to have it as </p>

<pre><code>@user = User.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>

<p>when you are showing a specific user. rails needs to find the user_id. That is why you are getting that error.</p>

<p>if you look at your sessions create method it is creating via sessions[:id] = user.id</p>

<p>the user_id column is automatically created when you create a table.</p>
