<p>If you put an ampersand before your function name, the function will return a reference to a variable instead of the value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returning by reference is useful when you want to use a function to
  find to which variable a reference should be bound. Do not use
  return-by-reference to increase performance. The engine will
  automatically optimize this on its own. Only return references when
  you have a valid technical reason to do so.</p>
