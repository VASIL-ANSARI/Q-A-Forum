<p>I found out the reason it gave me an error is because the declared more int variables after the array assignment. For example,</p>

<pre><code>...
foo[5] = 1;
foo[6] = 2;

int bar = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>This will not compile, it will highlight the "int bar" line and shows a syntax error.</p>

<p>seems like one cannot declare more variables with their types after the array assignment.</p>

<p>This might due to the fact that IC is an simplified version of C.</p>
