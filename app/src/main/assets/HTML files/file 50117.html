<p>To start, you don't have to transform the file into a string, you can just save it as a file. You have the possibility of losing data by continuing to do that. See: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/411592/how-do-i-save-a-stream-to-a-file-in-c">How do I save a stream to a file in C#?</a></p>

<p>If you're looking for another service to save files, then you should look into Azure Blob Storage. It will allow you to upload as much data as you want to a storage service for arbitrary files. See for example:
