<p>If you wish to construct a rule that has the effect of applying two rules in sequence, you can do it like this: suppose you have two converters</p>

<pre><code>Ax+B
Cx+D
</code></pre>

<p>If you apply them in sequence, the result would be</p>

<pre><code>C(Ax+B)+D = CAx+CB+D
</code></pre>

<p>which can be rewritten as a single rule with multiplier <code>CA</code> and summand <code>CB+D</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ConversionRule combine(ConversionRule r1, ConversionRule r2) {
    ConversionRule res;
    res.multiplier = r1.multiplier*r2.multiplier;
    res.summand = r2.multiplier*r1.summand + r2.summand;
    return res;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can combine multiple rules in a chain by applying the same logic in a loop.</p>
