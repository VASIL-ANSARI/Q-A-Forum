<p>This is undefined behavior and is compiler/platform specific. Printf functions with erroneous arguments will start ripping variables from the stack and then anything can happen.</p>

<p>That is why the compiler will normally complain about this</p>

<pre><code>source.c:5:5: warning: conversion lacks type at end of format [-Wformat]
source.c:5:5: warning: conversion lacks type at end of format [-Wformat]
source.c:5:5: warning: conversion lacks type at end of format [-Wformat]
source.c:5:5: warning: spurious trailing '%' in format [-Wformat]
</code></pre>
