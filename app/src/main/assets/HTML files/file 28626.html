<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>a[a[:,2]&gt;=15.0, :]
</code></pre>

<p>Note the inversion of <code>a[:,2]&lt;15.0</code> to <code>a[:,2]&gt;=15.0</code>, so that you're describing rows that you want to <em>keep</em> rather than <em>remove</em>.</p>

<p>If inverting your condition isn't as simple as that, you could also use <code>~</code>:</p>

<pre><code>a[~(a[:,2]&lt;15.0), :]
</code></pre>
