<p>Assuming that you're storing your reminders somewhere, perhaps in the plist. You could write a unit test to generate a Reminder object, store it, retrieve the data, and finally generate a usable Reminder class object.</p>

<p>That way you know several things:</p>

<p>A: Your Reminder generation is working</p>

<p>B: Your method of storing the data is working</p>

<p>C: Going from Data to your Reminder object is working</p>

<p>However, you should not expect to be able to Unit test the actual "functionality" of your app. Such as touch events or navigation controls. These should be left to Acceptance testing which is an entirely different discussion.</p>
