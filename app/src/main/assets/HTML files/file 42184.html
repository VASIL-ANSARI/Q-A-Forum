<p>I must apologise, I think it must have been my twin screen setup! It displays perfectly on my laptop when I run it in single screen mode. MASSIVE facepalm! When I reconnect the second monitor and refresh the clipping is still evident (although apparently slightly less so since a reboot so maybe Dave had something with the cache issue?) Thanks to all who've contributed and SIGNIFICANT apologies for having wasted your time on this! <em>Really</em> should have stripped it down to basics and tried to remove all variables before posting, I've overcomplicated the issue (gonna claim noob numpty for my lack of experience in website building as the cause).</p>

<p>Anyway, big thank you for being my rubber ducks<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/" rel="nofollow"> (Coding Horror - Rubber Duck Problem Solving)</a></p>

<p>Tempted to give myslef a downvote for this...</p>
