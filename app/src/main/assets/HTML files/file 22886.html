<p>Probably the best way to do it is to create a web service (WCF or Asmx) for accessing data and let your client (Processing.js) fetch the data from there using JSON or XML once the page is loaded. Using such services with jQuery <code>ajax</code> method is trivial, and you'll get cleaner MVC-like environment on the client side.</p>

<p>So, to reiterate:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a web service using C# and your existing methods to retrieve the data from the DB and send it to client over HTTP</li>
<li>Access this service using <code>ajax</code> or similar functions from jQuery core library.</li>
<li>Process the data on the client side and create the necessary DOM elements for fetched data.</li>
</ol>
