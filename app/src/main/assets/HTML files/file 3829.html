<p>As stated in the above comments, a form is being submitted when the button <code>#print_button</code> is clicked. This would force the page to refresh.</p>

<p>To prevent this, add a return value of <code>false</code> to the <code>onclick</code> event. This would cancel the form submission.</p>

<pre><code>window.print();
return false;
</code></pre>
