<p>You would have to place your function calls in the parent page (the one you are calling your AJAX from) this will allow you to exec the functions contained in the AJAX request. failing that there is another method but I would not advise using it but it is a possible to use <code>eval</code></p>

<p>Assuming the links you want to intercept are the ones in your code, you could always change it to:</p>

<pre><code>$('#letters a').live("click", function(){
    var link = $(this).attr("href");
    $.post(link,{},function(data){
        $('div#ajax-loader').empty();
        $('div#ajax-loader').load(data);
    });
});
</code></pre>
