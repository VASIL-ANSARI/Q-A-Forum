<p>The block that you pass to define_method can include some parameters.  That's how your defined method accepts arguments.  When you define a method you're really just nicknaming the block and keeping a reference to it in the class.  The parameters come with the block.  So:</p>

<pre><code>define_method(:say_hi) { |other| puts "Hi, " + other }
</code></pre>
