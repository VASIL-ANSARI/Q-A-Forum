<p>Without more information, it's a bit hard to diagnose your issue. However, I would say that it is likely your web API is interpreting the expected response type and providing an empty result as it does not support responses of that type, such as happens with ASP .NET Web API websites.</p>

<p>In that sense, the <code>DownloadString</code> is indicating it is expecting a <code>text/html</code> response. You should probably download the Microsoft ASP .NET Web API Client Libraries with NuGet. This library will give you <code>HttpClient</code> which has support for making the queries you want to make with responses such as <code>application/json</code> and <code>application/xml</code>.</p>

<p>You can view a tutorial on how to do the calls <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-clients/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want it to work from your web browser, you need to ensure the <code>Accept</code> header field is correct, as you mentioned. Ensure it is being communicated with IE by using something like Fiddler.</p>
