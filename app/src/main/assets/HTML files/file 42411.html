<p>I know it's a little out of time for answering, I had the same problem some time ago and I didn't find any plugin for doing it. So what I did was integrate fpdf.</p>

<p>It is really easy. Just download the last version from <a href="http://www.fpdf.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, save it on one folder on your directory and include it on your function.php. </p>

<p>Then, you will be able to build an html string and generate the pdf file with it. Take a look at the tutorials on the fpdf page, they will be really useful for knowing what tags you will be able to use.</p>

<p>good luck!</p>
