<p>As it seems there's no functionality in counter cache itself to accomplish this, I ended up doing a little detour, but which in itself is actually is quite simple. It simply narrows down the objects which to rank with counter cache to those that got new likes in 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>application_helper.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code> def trending_posts
    likes = Like.where("created_at &gt;= ?", Time.now - 24.hours).select(:liked_id)
    trending = Post.where(id: likes)
    trending.order("COALESCE(likes_count, 0) DESC").limit(3)
 end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>view.html.eb</strong></p>

<pre><code> &lt;%= render trending_posts %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone has any improvement ideas on this, it's greatly appreciated, I'm sure, by a lot of people. I'm not going to mark this an accepted answer in case someone comes up with the ultimate way to do this.</p>
