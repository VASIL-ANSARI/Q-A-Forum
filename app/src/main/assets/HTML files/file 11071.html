<p>It's called MVC.</p>

<p>You need to construct a data model for you application, write some sort of Record objects, and then you can determine their status.  So your application would have some sort of <code>CalendarEvent</code> model, and when you load data from the server, you would instantiate instances.</p>

<p>So when changing views, you would first check to see if you had the model object for that view, and if you did, you wouldn't need to load it from the server (unless you want to check for changes).  </p>

<p>Your scheme doesn't need to be that complicated.  If you load events by Id, you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>window.App = {};
window.App.Models = {};
</code></pre>

<p>when you load a record you could put</p>

<p><code>window.App.Models[id] = InstanceOfYourRecord</code></p>

<p>and that way its pretty fast to look for records.  Or just use a framework (like Sproutcore) that has a robust data layer.</p>
