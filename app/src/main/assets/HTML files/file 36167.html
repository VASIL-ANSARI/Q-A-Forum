<p>as per my guessing it is happening
 cause your using theme which is not supporting to actionbar and your calling actionbar related code in such activity i mean your app may be crashing in that activity where you write actionbar related code but unfortunately the theme for that activity is not actionbar related theme thats why may be it comes </p>

<p>use actionbar related theme in that activity using </p>

<pre><code> android:theme="@style/actionbar supported theme"
</code></pre>

<p>line in manifest against that activity</p>
