<p>There's not really much of a call for <em>any</em> of those data structures in a simple game like Rock, Paper Scissors.</p>

<p>I suppose you <em>could</em> use a queue to store individual results so you canm tally them up at the end rather than keeping a running total of wins, losses and draws in three simple variables.</p>

<p>Or you could maintain statistics in a tree, detailing what the user tended to choose after each run. For example, to pick out patterns like "user chooses rocks after paper 73% of the time" or "there's an inordinately large number of 'rock-rock-scissors' sequences". This may allow your algorithm to adjust to behavioural characteristics of its opponent.</p>

<p>But, in all honesty, I think your choice of game was ... ill-advised (pax said tactfully). My advice would be to go back to your educator and state that flat out, asking if you could change it to something more suitable. You'll probably find they're happy to accommodate you if you show the intestinal fortitude to admit you were wrong.</p>

<p>And, next time, don't leave your run so late. The path through the IT industry is littered with the bodies of those who, while technically adept, couldn't manage their time well enough to just get stuff <em>done</em> :-)</p>
