<p>The code <code>isbnNumber[100]</code> checks the 101st element of the array. The loop will only exit if you enter 0 on the 100th iteration.</p>

<p>Also, it should be noted that <code>isbnNumber[100]</code> is not an element of the <code>isbnNumber</code> array. Array indexing begins at zero, so the last element in <code>isbnNumber</code> is <code>isbnNumber[99]</code>. Accessing elements past the end of the array is undefined behavior. If you were entering 0 on the 100th iteration, this is why the loop didn't exit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you really should have something to prevent the loop from running past the end of the array. Here's how you would have the loop run until you enter 0 or you've hit the end of the array.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 99; i++) {
    printf("ISBN number: ");
    scanf("%d", &amp;isbnNumber[i]);
    if (isbnNumber[i] == 0)
        break;
}
</code></pre>
