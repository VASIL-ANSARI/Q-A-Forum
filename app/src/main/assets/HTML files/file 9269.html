<p>I <strong>try</strong> to use partials whenever I feel it will clean up my code. <strong>Especially</strong> if you are re-using the code in any other section of your site. I often will put loops into partials too.</p>

<pre><code>User.all.each do |user|
  render :partial =&gt; do_stuff, :locals =&gt; {:user =&gt; user}
end
</code></pre>

<p>This way, if I ever need to change this, it's easy to find, and the code is separated from my other layouts/views. It's good to separate different features or aspects of your views into their own files. Although you will have more files, it should greatly assist you in the long run. </p>

<p>If someone asks you for a hotfix, you may have a better idea of where to go to make your change.</p>

<p>A great IDE also helps for navigation through your methods and whatnot. Rubymine is excellent for this.</p>

<p>I hope this helped some.</p>
