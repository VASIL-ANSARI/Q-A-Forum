<p>There are a number of ways to do this, including something like what you have done here.  The first thing to do is remove the <code>while()</code> loop at the end of your <code>Runnable</code> and instead just have the <code>Runnable</code> post itself as long as the count is less than 49.  What you have now is posting the same <code>Runnable</code> multiple times each time it is run, all triggered to be delivered at the same time to the main <code>Handler</code>.</p>
