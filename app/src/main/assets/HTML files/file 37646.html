<p>Regarding your first question, there is no way to query for a particular message in that way you are describing.</p>

<p>The problem for your "Not Working"-case is likely that by the time the Sinch SDK fetches the instant message and is about to notify the message client delegate, your <code>Chat View</code> has not yet been instantiated / assigned to be the delegate, and because of that the message is "missed" by the delegate.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to have a non-ViewController component implement the <code>SINMessageClientDelegate</code>, and make that component have a life-cycle that is independent of your view controllers. I.e. have the component acting as the delegate be created at application launch, and keep it alive. Then you can be sure to always receive all <code>onIncomingMessage:</code>, and you can also place logic for persisting messages there.</p>
