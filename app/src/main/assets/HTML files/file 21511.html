<p>The function <code>filter2D</code> performs image filtering in full precision and then saturates the resulting values to the destination data type. Actually, the output image contains a larger range of values. When you specify the type <code>CV_32F</code> the output values are kept as is. They may contain values larger than 255 and less than 0. But when the type is <code>CV_8U</code>, the results are clamped to the range of <code>CV_8U</code> data type. All the negative values become 0 and all the values larger than 255, will become 255.</p>
