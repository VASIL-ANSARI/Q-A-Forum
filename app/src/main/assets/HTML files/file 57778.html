<p>Have look at <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API" rel="nofollow">OverpassAPI</a>, it allows to dig deep and fast in the  OpenStreetMap objects around a specific position. </p>

<p>To perform OverpassAPI requests in your Android context, you can either try <a href="https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/blob/master/OSMBonusPack/src/main/java/org/osmdroid/bonuspack/location/OverpassAPIProvider.java" rel="nofollow">OSMBonusPack OverpassAPIProvider</a> with the KML flavour, or implement your own request/response parsing. </p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>You will need a clear understanding of <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lanes" rel="nofollow">OSM lanes tagging conventions</a>. 
This said, I quickly made some trials using OverpassAPI interface integrated in OSMNavigator, just searching with "highway" key: it works. </p>

<p>When on an actual highway, I found "lanes=2" on each side. On usual roads, no "lanes" key defined. </p>
