<p>I use this to run scripts in the background without waiting for them to finish:</p>

<pre><code>$cmd = "$ffmpeg -i ".$folder.$final_file." ".$destination_md4." ";
pclose(popen("start /B $cmd", 'r'));
</code></pre>

<p>I've also seen this suggested as a way to run background processes in Windows:</p>

<pre><code>$WshShell = new COM("WScript.Shell");
$WshShell-&gt;Run($cmd, 0, false);
</code></pre>
