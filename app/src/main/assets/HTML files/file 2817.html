<p>I can think of 3 ways. </p>

<ol>
<li>put the dlls in the same folder as your application (you cannot do this?)</li>
<li>Use runtime linking.  <code>LoadLibrary()</code> and <code>GetProcAddress()</code></li>
<li>Use a manifest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374182(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374182(VS.85).aspx</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But if the dll isn't in the same folder as the .exe, how are you going to know where it is? forget Windows not knowing, how do <em>you</em> know?</p>
