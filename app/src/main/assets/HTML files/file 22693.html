<p>Just put the specific code into a separate method. You don't appear to be using anything from super. Unless you are?</p>

<pre><code>class CompactCar &lt; Car
  def some_method
    super
    compact_car_specific_code
  end

  # Test this method in isolation.
  def compact_car_specific_code
    # code specific to CompactCar... I want to test this
  end
end
</code></pre>
