<p>Why it does not work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>PlayerTypeAdapter should implements JsonSerializer. Does it?</p></li>
<li><p>If it does - than should work. It work perfect for me, so don't see reason why it does not work for you. Start you application in debug, put breakpoints and checkout. There should be some reason.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In your test where is Gson builder with adapter? You should change it:</p>

<pre><code>public void testJson() throws Exception
{
    Player player = new MagicPlayer(); //BeanUtils.createDefault(Player.class);
    player.setName("Alice");

    // this is wrong if you want adapter
    /* Gson gson = new Gson(); */

    // this is what you nead
     Gson gson = new GsonBuilder()
        .registerTypeAdapter(Player.class, new PlayerTypeAdapter())
        .create();

    System.out.println(gson.toJson(bean));
}
</code></pre>
