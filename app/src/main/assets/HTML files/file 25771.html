<p>I would try joining your lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>IWebElement cartSize = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("div[class='cart-size']&gt;div"));                                                        
string actualMsg = cartSize.Text;
</code></pre>

<p>So that they are:</p>

<pre><code>string actualMsg = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("div[class='cart-size']&gt;div")).Text;
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the text will be retrieved on the element as it is selected. I am wondering if between getting a handle on the element via its parent and retrieving the text you are losing focus on that element. Alternatively, remove the <code>&gt;div</code> from your css and see if it retrieves the text anyway.</p>

<p>This not working suggests the situation you are facing is the point under the title <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/exceptions/stale_element_reference.jsp" rel="nofollow">The Element is not Attached to the DOM</a>. The fact that your target text is within only divs suggests that this area is being styled by javascript and thus may only be active at certain times. If this element is not active, but is accessible, you can still receive the <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>, as indicated at that page. Your next step would be to see if you can click a parenting div to activate this target div prior to accessing its text (eg. make sure the element is attached to the DOM then call the code you have provided).</p>
