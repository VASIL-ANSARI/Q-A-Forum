<p>Closing database <code>myDB.close();</code> is not enough to avoid locks. You need to close the <code>cursors</code> which you are using for <code>database</code> operations before closing the database or when the operation with the cursor is completed. If you are using <code>Thread</code>s please make sure they also must be properly closed.</p>
