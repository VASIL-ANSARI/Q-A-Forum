<p>You will need to call the function which calls the ajax request on page load.. your values are getting lost as it will reset to default <code>undefined/null</code> etc when the user loads the page again. </p>

<p>If you want the onload method to take parameters, you can do something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() {
  // put something here so the function will not call if the ajax call has not been called beforee
  yourFunction(param1, param2);
};
</code></pre>

<p>This onload will call the function for you therefore no matter what running the ajax call each time. </p>

<p>of course you will need validation so it does not call that function if the ajax request has not been used before.i.e. something in the query string when its successful etc.</p>
