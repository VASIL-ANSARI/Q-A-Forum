<p>You can take the path to the file as an input to the program. For taking input, you can have a look at <a href="http://www.programmingsimplified.com/java/source-code/java-program-take-input-from-user" rel="nofollow">http://www.programmingsimplified.com/java/source-code/java-program-take-input-from-user</a></p>
