<p>De-Serialize the example JSON into a full Example object, use the name properties of the Example object to build a String of the things you want, forget about the Example object.</p>

<p>I don't really understand the second question completely, but if you have a full Test1 object will all the fields/properties then you can create a Test2 object which takes the fields from Test1 which it wants. E.g your Test2 object can accept Test1 as a parameter in its constructor and take only the properties which it needs ignoring the rest.</p>
