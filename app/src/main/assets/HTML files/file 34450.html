<p>I think your question is wrong. Would do you mean when you say <em>"the pdf page does not have header info or body is empty"</em>? Because that doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>A few observations: I think you're using an obsolete version of iTextSharp. <a href="http://itextpdf.com/salesfaq" rel="nofollow">Read the FAQ</a> to find out why this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Newer versions of iTextSharp will throw an exception because of this error:</p>

<pre><code>pdfData.BeginText();
//show text as per position and rotation
string strCustomMessage="PDF Stamping Test"
pdfData.ShowText(strCustomMessage);
//call endText to invalid font set
pdfData.EndText();
</code></pre>

<p>In these lines, you are violating the PDF reference: you are showing text within a BT/ET sequence without defining a font and size. Had you used a newer version of iTextSharp, an exception would have pointed that out. You need to move the line with the <code>SetFontAndSize()</code> method <em>inside</em> the <code>BeginText()</code>/<code>EndText()</code> sequence. It's illegal to use it outside a text object.</p>

<p>Also: why are you using <code>BeginText()</code>/<code>EndText()</code> to add text? That is code for <strong>PDF specialists</strong>. Read the documentation to find out how to use <code>ColumnText.ShowTextAligned()</code>. The <code>ShowTextAligned()</code> method is a convenience method written for developer who aren't fluent in PDF syntax.</p>

<p>Whether or not the text added with <code>ShowText()</code> is visible will depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>the opacity of the page:</em> Suppose that your page consists of a scanned image, you won't see any text, because you're adding the text <em>under</em> the image. Use the <code>GetOverContent()</code> method instead of the <code>GetUnderContent()</code> method to avoid this.</li>
<li><em>the position on the page:</em> I see that you get the size of the page using the <code>GetPageSizeWithRotation()</code> method, but I don't see you doing anything with that info. I don't see at which coordinate you are showing the text. That is also wrong. You need to make sure that you add the text inside the visible area of the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>This answer lists several problems with your code. It would be better if you simplify your code by using the <code>ShowTextAligned()</code> and correct X,Y coordinates.</p>
