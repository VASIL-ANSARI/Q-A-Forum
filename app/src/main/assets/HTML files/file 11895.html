<p>You aren't; you're creating an instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> and storing a reference to that instance within a variable whose type is <code>BaseClass</code>. Any variable in C# (or virtually <em>any</em> object-oriented language) that is of type <code>T</code> can hold a reference (or pointer, depending on your language) to any object whose type is <code>T</code> or a type that derives from <code>T</code> at some point. </p>

<p>Doing this (in C#, anyway) has no effect whatsoever on how the object is constructed, so there is no "effect" in any strict sense.</p>
