<p>It sounds like something is misconfigured with your iOSOpenDev installation, because it <em>should</em> allow you to create a <code>dylib</code>.</p>

<p>That said, if you follow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10509453/119114">the instructions in this answer</a>, you can manually tweak some settings files to override the default (which doesn't allow dylibs to be built for iOS).  This may need to be done each time you reinstall/upgrade Xcode.</p>
