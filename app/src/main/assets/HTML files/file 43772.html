<p>First of all your array is initialized but empty.
second, are you trying to get an input directly into the expression of an array?</p>

<pre><code>state[i].link0=state[s.nextInt()];//THIS PART
</code></pre>

<p>Have you tried this?</p>

<pre><code>int headedTo = s.nextInt();
state[i].link0=state[headedTo];
</code></pre>

<p>This happens because <code>state[i].link0</code> is trying to access a value inside the array, but that value is null because you are trying to get it before you can make the input, not sure it will work after you fill the array.</p>
