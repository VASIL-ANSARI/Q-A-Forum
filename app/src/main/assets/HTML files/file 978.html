<p>I don't think there's a way to do this in commons httpclient. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense either, after all it is a HTTP client and "media:///squishy.jpg" is not HTTP, so all the code to implement the HTTP protocol probably couldn't be used anyways.</p>

<pre><code>URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(...)
</code></pre>

<p>could be the way to go, but you'll probably have to do a lot of protocol coding by hand, depending on your "media"-protocol.</p>
