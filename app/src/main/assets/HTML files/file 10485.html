<p>It's unnecessarily complex, the simplest 'safe' way to do DCL is like so:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  private volatile Helper helper = null;
  private final Object mutex = new Object(); 
  public Helper getHelper() {
    if (helper == null) {
        synchronized(mutex) {
            if (helper == null) {
                helper = new Helper();
            }
        }
    }
    return helper;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key points here being:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the 'happy' case we expect helper to already be assigned, so if it is we can just return it without having to enter a synchronized block.  </li>
<li>Helper is marked as volatile to let the compiler know that helper can be read from / written to by any thread at any time and it's important that read / writes are not re-ordered.  </li>
<li>The synchronized block uses a private final variable to synchronize on to avoid a potential performance hit in the case of another area of code synchronizing on the <code>this</code> instance.</li>
</ul>
