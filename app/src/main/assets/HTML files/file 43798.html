<p>You will need to define <code>self.urllib_data</code> prior to accessing it. The simples way would be to create it during initialization, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>class LibAccess(object):
    def __init__(self,url):
        self.url = url
        self.urllib_data = None
</code></pre>

<p>That way you can make sure it exists everytime you try to access it. From your code I take it that you do not want to obtain the actual data during initialization. Alternatively, you could call <code>self.url_lib()</code> from <code>__init__(..)</code> to read the data for the first time. Updating it later on would be done in the same way as before.</p>
