<p>Normally, <code>empty($var_name)</code> would be more reliable, which will return true for anything <code>null</code>, blank, or undefined. This even includes empty arrays.</p>

<p>However, in this case, you are returning a DB object. Which will always return true for <a href="http://us1.php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php" rel="nofollow">isset</a>, and false for <a href="http://us1.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php" rel="nofollow">empty</a>. So you are going to want to use the DB object API. In which case, you should use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.rowcount.php" rel="nofollow">rowCount</a>.</p>
