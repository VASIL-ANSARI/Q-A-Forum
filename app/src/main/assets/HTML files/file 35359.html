<p>Here are a few different answers. My guess is that the first one is the right one, the
easy one and sufficient, but it's very hard to be sure.</p>

<h1>Possible Answer 1: Use SQL</h1>

<p>As the comments indicate it sounds awfully lot like a join. In addition your post seem
to indicate that you only take an action when a match is found and that not every element
in A have a match. This mean your SQL statement should only return the matching rows, not
all of them. It doesn't matter that you can't do everything i SQL, if you can let it 
organise your data for you.</p>

<h1>Possible Answer 2: Sort the arrays</h1>

<p>Maybe you can sort the arrays (again, preferably let your database do this). Possibly you
can sort B so that search for a match is quicker. Or put the search value in the key of the
array so that searching is very quick. Or if you are lucky you might be able to sort both
arrays in a way that makes all A's and B's in the same order. i.e. for any A you pick you
know that the right B either do not exist or exist later in the B array.</p>

<h1>Possible Answer 3: Explain more about the problem</h1>

<p>You have only given us your current algorithm, not what you are actually trying to do. Most
likely iterating over everything is not the best idea, but no one can say unless they know
more about your data and what you want to do in the end.</p>
