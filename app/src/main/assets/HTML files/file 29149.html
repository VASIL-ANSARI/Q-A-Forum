<p>I haven't tried this out personally, but you may find <a href="https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr#using-grunt" rel="nofollow">tiny-lr</a> worth looking into. If you are writing a custom task then you can post a request to the tiny-lr server to reload multiple files at once (you could potentially do this via something like grunt-shell):</p>

<pre><code># notify a single change
curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=style.css

# notify using a longer path
curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=js/app.js

# notify multiple changes, comma or space delimited
curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=index.html,style.css,docs/docco.css
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if the standard config does what you require on its own, but its worth a shot:</p>

<pre><code>grunt.loadNpmTasks('tiny-lr');
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    reload: {
      files: ['**/*.html', '**/*.js', '**/*.css', '**/*.{png,jpg}'],
      tasks: 'tinylr-reload'
    }
  }
});

grunt.registerTask('reload', ['tinylr-start', 'watch']);
</code></pre>

<p>There's also <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-newer" rel="nofollow">grunt-newer</a> which only runs tasks based on the files that changed. I use this with my watch setup and it saves a lot of time, because it doesn't have to process every single file each time only one is saved.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
