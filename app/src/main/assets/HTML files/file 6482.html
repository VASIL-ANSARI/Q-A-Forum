<p>Scala <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Enumeration">enumerations</a> are distinct from Java enumerations.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is no way add methods to it (in a sane way). There are some work-arounds, but nothing which works in all cases <em>and</em> doesn't look like syntactic garbage.</p>

<p>I tried something similiar (adding methods to enumerated instance of a class, while being able to create new instances at runtime and having a working equivalence relationship between the <code>object</code>s and the <code>new</code> instances of the class), but was stopped by bug <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/4023">#4023</a> ("getClasses/getDeclaredClasses seems to miss some (REPL) or all (scalac) classes (objects) declared").</p>

<p>Have a look at these related questions by me:</p>

</ul>

<p>Honestly, I wouldn't use <code>Enumeration</code>. This is a class originating from Scala 1.0 (2004) and it has weird stuff in it and not many people (except those who have written it) understands how to use it without an tutorial first.</p>

<p>If I would absolutely need an enumeration I would just write that class in Java.</p>
