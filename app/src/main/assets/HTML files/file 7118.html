<p>Imagine having a <code>struct</code> that keeps a value and the type of that value. When the type is set to a particular type, you would only need to use one of the members of the <code>union</code> rather than waste space for three of them when you use only one simultaneously.</p>

<pre><code>struct {
  int type;

  union {
    int intval;
    double dval;
    char cval;
  } value;
}
</code></pre>
