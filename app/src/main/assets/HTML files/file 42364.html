<p>I've been trying to do this, and I've found that I can't do this with certain network printers, but with local printers it works.</p>

<p>What I did was launch PowerShell as local admin and run it from there:</p>

<pre><code>public void RenamePrinter(string strCurrentName, string strNewPrinterName)
{
    var newProcessInfo = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo
    {
        FileName = @"C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe",
        Verb = "runas",
        CreateNoWindow = true,
        Arguments = "-Command \"$printer = get-wmiobject win32_printer | where { $_.Name -eq '" + strCurrentName + "' }; $printer.RenamePrinter('" + strNewPrinterName + "')\""
    };
    System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(newProcessInfo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I receive the same "Access Denied" error when I attempt this with network printers (maybe it's a driver thing? I don't know) but this works for local printers.</p>
