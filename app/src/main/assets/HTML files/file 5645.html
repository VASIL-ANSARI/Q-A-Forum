<p>From what I understand, <code>PipeFilter</code> must be an abstract or interface in order to make full use of the factory design pattern. Of course, this is not always true. </p>

<p>In genreal, factory design pattern is used to handle the instantiation object, such as what sub type of object to be created, and may also involve setting object properties.</p>

<p>In many case, a factory method is used in conjunction with arguments. You many want to specify the type or condition for which an object of type <code>PipeFilter</code> to be created.</p>

<p>In your problem here, you might be able to solve your proble by passing integer or condition as argument of factory method, <code>createPipeFilter(int i)</code> or <code>createPipeFilter(OutputType otype)</code>.</p>
