<p>qUtf16Printable returns:"Returns str as a const ushort *, but cast to a const wchar_t * to avoid warnings"</p>

<p>But in your code you are not assigning the return value to a pointer, the return value is assigned to a character (const wchar_t).</p>

<p>probably try</p>

<pre><code>const wchar_t* keyPtr = .........
</code></pre>

<p>That could be the problem</p>
