<p>Something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>    //get your string
    String str = "whatevertextyouwanthere";
    //turn it into an array of chars
    char[] strChars = str .toCharArray();
    //set array at position 1 to an x
    //Check to make sure the length is above -
    if (str.length() != 0)
{
    //Check that we have a value of some sorts in the char array
    if (strChars[0] != ''
{
    //replace the char at place 0 with X
    strChars[0] = 'x';//this might need to be 1
}
}
    //turn the array back into a string
    str = String.valueOf(strChars);
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally you should have this within a function for ease of use and re-usability. It should return whatever the value of str is.</p>

<p>Post this in your onCreate:</p>

<pre><code>ed1.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {

          public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {

            abc(ed1.getText().toString()); 

          }

          public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int count, int after) {}

          public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count) {}
       });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The above was just some code I wrote really quickly but should do what you need it to do. You need to have a listener watching for changes to the edit text.</p>
