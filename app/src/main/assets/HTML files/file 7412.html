<p>According to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html</a>
the state value of MEDIA_SHARED means that it is present in the phone, not mounted in the droid os, but mounted via the usb.....</p>

<p>So even though it is not mounted in windows it would seem that your droid thinks it is.</p>

<p>Maybe try unplugging it and replugging it?</p>
