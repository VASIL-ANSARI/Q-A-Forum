<p>It gives the ability to change the typedef in one place rather than searching-and-replacing all over the codebase if the need somehow arose to change the underlying type. However, I also find it more "noise" than anything and have rarely seen it ever needed in a real-life scenario.</p>

<p>The only example I've seen a decent use is for floats if you happen to be working in games and might have need to have your game ported from/to the Nintendo DS since the DS natively works with fixed-point numbers. In that case, you have a special typedef for the float so that it really is typedef'ed to a float on most platforms and to a special fixed-point class on the DS.</p>
