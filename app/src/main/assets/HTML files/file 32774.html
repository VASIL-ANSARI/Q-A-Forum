<p>Basically what you are doing in <code>a</code> is just declaring the function whereas for <code>b</code> you are declaring the function and on the same line defining it again as <code>b</code>.  To prove this you can try something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>a = function b(){}
a.name // results in b
</code></pre>

<p>So really you can avoid declaring and assigning and simply declare the function as you do with <code>a</code>.  To answer your question, the second form is a longer, unnecessary way of writing the first form.</p>
