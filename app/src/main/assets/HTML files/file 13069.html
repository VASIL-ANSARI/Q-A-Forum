<p>It's very difficult to know hot to correct your code without knowing what you're passing to <code>perfect_date_format</code>, but I'll make a wild guess and assume that <a href="http://us2.php.net/strtotime" rel="nofollow"><code>strtotime</code></a> understands how to parse your <code>$date</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public function perfect_date_format($date) {
    $time = strtotime($date);
    return date("H:ia \o\\n\ l, F jS, Y", $time);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, then please provide the format of the data you're passing as <code>$date</code>.</p>
