<p>I have answered my own question: The reason I was getting "cache-control: max-age" values of 0, and no "expires" values in my HTTP headers, was because I was just reloading the page in Firefox. Upon starting a new Private Browsing session (resetting the cache in the process), and loading the page for the first time, I received the expected headers.</p>
