<p><code>canvas.create_rectangle(self.pipe_pos, fill = "green")</code> returns an ID.</p>

<p>You can use this ID to put it into methods like</p>

<pre><code>canvas.coords
canvas.delete
canvas.itemconfigure
canvas.scale
canvas.type
...
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at <code>help(canvas)</code>.</p>

<p>The canvas is not a framebuffer on which you paint stuff for one frame. The painted stuff does not go away and you can move it and change all the parameters you can use when creating.</p>
