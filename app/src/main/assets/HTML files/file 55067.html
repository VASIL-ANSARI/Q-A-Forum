<p>Most SWT widgets are not designed to be extended and enforce this by checking that the current class is in the <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets</code> package. This can be worked around but is very strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>Widgets generally contain a lot of platform specific code, an override class might very easily end up using code which will only work on one platform.</p>

<p>There are various other ways to extend tables and trees. Using <code>TableEditor</code> and <code>TreeEditor</code> is one way. Drawing the table/tree yourself using <code>SWT.MeasureItem</code>, <code>SWT.PaintItem</code> and <code>SWT.EraseItem</code> is another. </p>
