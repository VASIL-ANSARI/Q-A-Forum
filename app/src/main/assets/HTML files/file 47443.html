<p>You can set the cookie in that function with an expiry.</p>

<p>Good documentation is available on this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, do a check and set in that function.</p>

<pre><code>$('body').one('mouseleave', function() {
    var cookie = document.cookie; //You need to find the cookie you need here (if it exists, don't do anything)
    return; //if exists
    $('.shadowbox').fadeIn(400)
    document.cookie = "myCookieName=true; expires=(datetime + 1day)"
});
</code></pre>

<p>That way, you only get to fade and setting if there isn't a cookie available.</p>
