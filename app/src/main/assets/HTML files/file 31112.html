<p>I'm guessing padding to accomodate the alignment requirement of some member. I am not familiar with these types so I can't explain the alignment of this structure, however.</p>

<p>If you really want to pack your struct in the most efficient way, you can order the members by size (decreasing). The compiler isn't normally allowed to reorder the members.</p>
