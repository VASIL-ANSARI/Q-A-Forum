<p>.Max() isn't supported, a workaround would be to do an reverse order and take the first:</p>

<pre><code>var ProjectionsQuery = proxy.OptionARMProjections
                       .Where(row =&gt; row.OptionARMRunId == proxy.OptionARMProjections
                       .OrderByDescending(r =&gt; r.OptionARMRunId))
                       .Take(1);
</code></pre>

<p>Correction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb535031%28VS.95%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Seems it is supported in Silverlight 3+</a>, but it's given me the same trouble more than once, so maybe someone can add some more details as to why.</p>
