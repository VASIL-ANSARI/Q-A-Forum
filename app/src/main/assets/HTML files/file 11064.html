<p>If you install <a href="http://parsetree.rubyforge.org/ruby_parser/">ruby_parser or parsetree</a>, you'll be able to do something like this (assuming that the program text is in <code>text</code>):</p>

<pre><code>result = RubyParser.new.parse(text)
result.flatten.to_a.select {|elt| elt.is_a?(String)}
</code></pre>

<p>(This could obviously be nicer, but it should be enough to get you started!)</p>
