<p>You only call updateDeviceList(devices) when the button is pressed.<br>
Shouldn't you call this elsewhere if you want it to occur before the button is pressed?
I see you invoke it from onActivityCreated. But I only see where you set the fragment definition, not instantiate it </p>

<pre><code>FragmentTransaction transaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
transction.add(R.id.device_list, devList).commit();
</code></pre>
