<p>You seem to encounter a problem with CMYK pdfs. Have you tried converting them to PNG? PNG -contrary to jpeg - only encodes RGB so the images will in any case be in the correct colorspace. </p>

<p>You might also want to have a look at ghostscript (the engine behind imagemagicks PDF conversion) and it's <code>--UseCIE</code> switch.  </p>

<p>I wrote a php-wrapper to ghostscript which you can find at <a href="https://github.com/heiglandreas/Org_Heigl_Ghostscript" rel="nofollow">github</a> that you might find usefull when you want to use ghostscript. </p>
