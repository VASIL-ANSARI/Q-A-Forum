<p>After searching a lot I found that the <strong>AsynchDNS</strong> was not enabled on my Linux machine and hence it was sequentially resolving the domains in the urls and hence taking a lot of time. After updating my libcurl library to 7.21.7 and enabling the AsynchDNS it worked as expected. </p>
