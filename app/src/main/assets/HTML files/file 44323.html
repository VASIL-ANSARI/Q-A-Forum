<p>The APNS service is best effort and not guaranteed delivery.  There isn't really any way to get an understanding about what notifications were delivered.</p>

<p>However, you can find out about failed notifications - but that is more to do with the app being uninstalled or push notifications turned off for the device itself:

<p>That might be the closest you can get via APNS.</p>

<p>Otherwise I'd recommend having some kind of phone-home call made by the app on start up to query the server about information it should have received so that you can get your state correct.</p>
