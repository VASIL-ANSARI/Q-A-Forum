<p>The problem was unrelated to the <code>require.ensure</code> implementation. It was caused by some weirdness in the way <code>ocLazyLoad</code> is packaged (<a href="https://github.com/ocombe/ocLazyLoad/issues/179" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ocombe/ocLazyLoad/issues/179</a>). The fix in my case was simple, I just added <code>'oc.lazyLoad'</code> to the module dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('parentApp', [
  'ui.router',
  'oc.lazyLoad'
])
</code></pre>

<p>To answer two of my own questions, Webpack does indeed make a request to the server for the bundle, and you do not have to manually load the bundle. One gotcha that really confused me: the <code>resolve</code> block will fail silently if it contains a promise that won't resolve. In my case <code>$ocLazyLoad.load()</code> was failing, but there was no indication of the failure. The only clue was that the state provider wasn't adding the <code>&lt;child-app&gt;&lt;/child-app&gt;</code> markup to the DOM, which meant that it was actually initializing the state.</p>
