<p>I had to go through the same thing (Massive VB6 app with no documentation and horrible code.). The only safe and reasonable route you can take is number 3. To improve something you must first understand it. If you take route 1 or 2 you are guaranteed to be left with a horrible mess.</p>

<p>Remember to always keep the idea in the back of your mind that your end goal is a full migration to .NET. As you are refactoring think about how VB6s awful OO support will look like in VB.NET or C#. If possible shift your code around to make the migration easier.</p>

<p>You may want to consider shifting a lot of your core functionality into a .NET DLL and exposing it to VB6 through COM. This will remove a ridiculous amount of code from your VB6 and will hopefully leave mostly business logic.</p>

<p>The most important thing you need to remember is don't be a cowboy. </p>
