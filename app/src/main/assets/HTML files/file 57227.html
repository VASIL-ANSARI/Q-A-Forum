<p>Hard to answer when there is almost no context in your question (What exactly isn't working and what exactly you are trying to scrape), but take a look at these lines:</p>

<pre><code>first_columns.append(row.findAll('td'))[0]
third_columns.append(row.findAll('td'))[2]
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>append</code> returns <code>None</code> these lines would raise an exception.</p>

<p>I believe they are meant to be:</p>

<pre><code>first_columns.append(row.findAll('td')[0])
third_columns.append(row.findAll('td')[2])
</code></pre>
