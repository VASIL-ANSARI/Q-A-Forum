<p>I would say it was (as always) practical reason. You can initialize object at one point and use it some time later - then you have to have some mechanism that ensure that everything was initialized into some default value in case we cannot set them immediately.</p>

<p>Local object on the other hand are used immediately after they were declared - so we can safely assume programmer is able to initiate them with their target value, and it should be encouraged.</p>

<p>Bottom line - just practical reasons, encouraging the good practices which would prevent some errors, nothing like technical limitations.</p>
