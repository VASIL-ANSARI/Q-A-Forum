<p>This is not a good way of doing that. You should use <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/fields_for" rel="nofollow">fields_for</a>. It will make your form cleaner. By the way, what you're doing in the controller is not working because you use <code>update_attributes</code> to update your model that makes your assigments useless. Using the above mentioned <code>fields_for</code> will help you to clean the controller too. But be careful because you surely will need <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods/accepts_nested_attributes_for" rel="nofollow">accepts_nested_attributes_for</a> in your model.</p>
