<p>I don't think there are enough details here to really answer your question, but here are some questions:</p>

<p>The sweeper should fire independently from the full_report action, so if you make a change to a Company, you should see the debugger fire (which it looks like is happening correctly). You don't then need to run the full_report action, so at this point you could verify the cached file has been removed. It could be useful to step through expire_action in the debugger to see if rails is skipping the expiry for some other reason.</p>

<p>EDIT:
oh you know what, I was just diggging into this, and it looks like expire_action is expected to run in a controller's context (I was reading the gem source in actionpack). It assumes 'self' is a controller, so your passing in the option :controller is being ignored.</p>

<p>Other examples give a specific string instead of options (e.g. <code>expire_action '/reports/full_report'</code>) I don't like that personally---it's not using the router---but it seems like it would work.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should switch to that method, ensure it works, and then in the debugger see if you have access to url_for. it could be as simple as <code>expire_action url_for(:controller =&gt; 'reports', :action =&gt; 'full_report')</code></p>
