<p>Few interesting things I realized trying to solve this.
First I have no border</p>

<pre><code>chart.Border = new SimpleBorder(SimpleBorderType.None, cOffice2007BackColor);
</code></pre>

<p>Than, I add the new border object just to export the chart with the border.</p>

<pre><code>chart.Border = new SimpleBorder(SimpleBorderType.Color, Color.Black);
chart.Export(FileFormat.Bitmap);
</code></pre>

<p>Than I revert the border. And, it exports the chart with the new border, but it doesn't resize the border. If it's larger than ExportImageSize, I see only left and top border, and if it's smaller, I get a part of the chart that goes outside the borders.</p>

<p>So, I set the the border to begin with, and only change the color for the exporting.</p>

<p>One more realization, explicitly setting the ExportImageSize can lead to some interesting side-effects. Even dough your plot looks really good, it sometimes cuts the legend, if it is to large</p>
