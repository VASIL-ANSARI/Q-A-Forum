<li><p>One clear thing I'm seeing is that your <code>$(document).ready()</code> function is located within another function.  This essentially alleviates the need for a <code>$(document).ready()</code> provided you only call that function once the DOM and jQuery are fully loaded.</p>

<p>Rearrange your code to only add the event listener once the DOM and jQuery are loaded.  <strong>That</strong> is what you use the <code>$(document).ready()</code> callback for.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition there is one more issue I see with the callback function for  <code>.each()</code>.  That function needs to handle two parameters the index and the element that it references. A call to <code>each()</code>  iterates over a collection of elements.  For each element entering the callback function, its index is passed as a parameter and also the element itself that is located at that index.  Check out the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more info.</p></li>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
 safari.application.addEventListener("command", performCommand, false);
 console.log("Document is ready to go!");
});

function performCommand(event) {  
  console.log("event recieved");
  if (event.command == "open-designs") {     
    console.log("got 'open-designs' event");
    $('a[href*="/Create/DesignProduct.aspx?"]').each(function(index,elem) {
      console.log("opening window", index, elem);
      window.open($(elem).attr('href'),'_blank');
    });
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>You use the <code>$(document).ready()</code> callback as an indication that your DOM is ready and jQuery has been initialized.  Once you know everything is ready, you can setup your event listener.
The function <code>performCommand()</code> can not be called before the listener is added (unless there is some other reference to it).</p>
