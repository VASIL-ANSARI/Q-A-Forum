<p>There are some standards for Javascript (called ECMAScript), and browsers more-or-less implement it.  The language itself is only a small part of what you need, though, to make something useful.  The DOM APIs are less standard, and so many developers use jQuery, or other frameworks, that deal with the inconsistencies.</p>
