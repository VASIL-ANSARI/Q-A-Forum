<p>Solved it. For anyone interested:</p>

<p>it looks like IE isn't always giving back the right error's, jquery ajax success, complete and error functions we're helpful in fixing it.
In the end it turned out that the problem was in the cross-domain ajax-call; IE is blocking them, unless you're using dataType: jsonp. Just regular json isn't good enough.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing you're thoughts!</p>
