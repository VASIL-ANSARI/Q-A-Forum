<p>Good list.  One of the things that you might want to establish - and I can't give you much advice since I'm just starting to think about it myself - is when a class should be in a different library, namespace, nested namespaces.  You might even want to figure out a list of libraries and namespaces beforehand and mandate that the team has to meet and decide to merge two/add a new one.  </p>

<p>Oh, just thought of something that I do that you might want to also.   I generally have a unit tests library with a test fixture per class policy where each test goes into a corresponding namespace.  I also tend to have another library of tests (integration tests?) which is in a more <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/" rel="nofollow">BDD style</a>.  This allows me to write tests to spec out what the method should do as well as what the application should do overall.</p>
