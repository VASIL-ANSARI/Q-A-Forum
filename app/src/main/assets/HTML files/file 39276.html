<p>I found a solution to this problem. It's a bit nasty, but this is all I can do. Assuming you have the currently chosen fragment saved in your activity, this is what you need to do in your activitys onResume:</p>

<pre><code>if(currentFragment instanceof YourDynamiclyChangingFrament) {
            FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
            FragmentTransaction transaction = fm.beginTransaction();
            YourDynamiclyChangingFrament yourDynamiclyChangingFrament= new YourDynamiclyChangingFrament();

            transaction.replace(R.id.container, yourDynamiclyChangingFrament, YourDynamiclyChangingFrament.class.getSimpleName());
            transaction.commit();
        }
</code></pre>
