<p>Two problems here:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're trying to combine inline and external JS, which is always a bit messy</li>
<li>You're not suppressing the native behaviour of submit buttons, which is to submit a form (which I assume you have in your HTML, even though it's not shown). In fact, you don't even need the button to be of type submit.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class="btn btn-home" name="discard" id="discard"&gt;Discard Changes&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>$('#discard').on('click', function(evt) {
    evt.preventDefault(); //don't submit the form, which a button naturally does
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to discard changes?'))
        location.href = 'http://www.weblink.com/manager.php'; //redirect only on confirm
});
</code></pre>
