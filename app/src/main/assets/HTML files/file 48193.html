<p>Yes. The algorithmic complexity may be the same, but an array is going to be faster generally, because the lookup procedure is much simpler. On the other hand when using an array the "keys" (indices) can only be integers, and an array is not sparse - if you store to <code>a[100]</code>, there will be at least 101 elements in the array afterwards.</p>

<p>(For extremely sparse arrays, a hash map should actually perform better).</p>
