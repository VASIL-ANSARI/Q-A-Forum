<p>My best guess (you don't provide any example of the server code that handles the request) is that you're only updating one side of the bidirectional association.  In other words you're just deserializing that A instance and doing a merge.  If you get a new A you still need to merge the A instance but you also need to load up all the B's that A no longer references and remove the A instance from their list and also look up all the B's that are newly referenced by A and add A to their list.  It's one of the hazards of a bidirectional relationship in code.</p>
