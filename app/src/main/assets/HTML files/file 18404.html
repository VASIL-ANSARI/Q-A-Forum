<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.showcheckboxes.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ShowCheckBoxes</code> property</a> doesn't really cover this case.</p>

<p>However, you can change the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treenode.showcheckbox.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ShowCheckBox</code> property</a> on each individual node after the tree is bound. That page contains some example code that even does it based on the node's depth, which looks like what you're after.</p>
