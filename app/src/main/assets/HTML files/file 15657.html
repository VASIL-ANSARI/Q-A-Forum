<p>The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> is being rendered above the page (31 pixels above it, to be exact). This is because IE7 does not support <code>height: inherit</code>. In fact it doesn't support <code>inherit</code> at all.</p>

<p>Set the height explicitly, and the navigation pops right into place.</p>
