<p>This has happened because your test cases are not properly designed.</p>

<p>Firstly, If you wish the data to be added to the database, you should commit the changes after any update/insert operation. You have to do a rollback only if there are any exceptions during transactions.</p>

<p>Design your tests some thing like this.</p>

<pre><code>        @BeforeTest
        public void setUp() {
            personDao.setEntityManager(entityManager);
            entityManager.getTransaction().begin();

        }

        @AfterTest
        public void tearDown() {
            // TODO clear all inserted data either using sql statement or JPA
            //Rollback only if there is any exception
            entityManager.getTransaction().rollback();
        }


        @Test
        public void findPersonById() {
        Long id = System.currentTimeMillis();

            personDao.savePerson(new Person(id,"Hans"));
            entityManager.flush();

           // TODO your assert statements go in here
           /* Data is visible till here during your debug. 
              Once AfterTest is executed then the your data would be rolled back
            */
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I have used testNG as my Unit testing tool, pls use appropriate tool based on your requirements.
Also, if you are enityManager.flush() insert/update statements would be sent to the DB but wont be committed until commit instruction is sent to the DB by HIbernate. Pls refer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4275973">this</a> answer for further details</p>
