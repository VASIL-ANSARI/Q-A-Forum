<p>As is evident of your latest screenshot the difference is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The row with "number" 17 ends with the letter 'n': 6E00 = <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/006E/index.htm" rel="nofollow">0x006E</a></li>
<li>The row with "number" 18 after that <code>n</code> ends with two spaces: <code>20002000</code> = 2x <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020/index.htm" rel="nofollow">0x0020</a></li>
<li>The row with "number" 19 after that <code>n</code> ends with a CR+LF linebreak sequence: <code>0D000A00</code> = <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000D/index.htm" rel="nofollow">0x000D</a> + <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000A/index.htm" rel="nofollow">0x000A</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So the three names really <em>are</em> different, it's just not a <em>visual</em> difference in the query tool that displays your rows.</p>

<p>To fix this during import you would have to trim whitespace from the end of the string, this should take care of those 3 different characters. Note that <code>LTRIM</code> and <code>RTRIM</code> only removes "blanks" which further down in the documentation suggests that only spaces are considered. You would thus have to use a different trim function, like in the programming language you're using, to do this trimming.</p>
