<p>I like to resolve this cases by doing it with a <code>foreach</code> loop.</p>

<p>The trick here is to place a name like it was an array.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    @{
        int idx = 0;
    }

    @foreach (var brand in Model.Brands)
    {
        @Html.TextBox("Brands[" + idx + "].Name", brand.Name);
        @Html.TextBox("Brands[" + idx + "].Url", brand.Url);
        @Html.TextBox("Brands[" + idx + "].Address.PostCode", brand.Address.PostCode);
        @Html.TextBox("Brands[" + idx + "].Address.Locality", brand.Address.Locality);

        idx++;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way you are sending the properties to be binded like an array. </p>

<p>PS: All the items need to be in order, there mustn't be any jump between idx, like <code>[1, 3, 4, 5]</code>, in this case it would only pass to the action <code>[1]</code></p>
