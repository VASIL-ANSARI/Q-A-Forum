<p>If you're asking to use ajax to retrieve the php file and execute it after retrieving it, I think the answer is  "no".  The ajax is client side, and the php is server side.  You CAN however call the php file FROM the jquery using .GET or .POST, process it with the data supplied, and return the results TO the ajax function to display it however you'd like.  There are thousands of simple examples if you google it.</p>
