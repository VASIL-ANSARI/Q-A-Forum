<p>If I understand this right, your 'title' on top of the input text field is an image ? If that's it, you should definitively change it to a label, and your problem is solved.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You should get ride of the prompt, and add your UISearchBar into a view. Then you can add an image for the bar into that view. To me this is the easiest solution.</p>
