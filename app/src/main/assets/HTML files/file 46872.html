<p>The problem you are facing is mostly because of the date string being malformed. Date strings have to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow">ISO-8601 format</a>. You can create such a formatted string by using the build-in JS function <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString" rel="nofollow">Date#toISOString</a> or via your date formatting library of choice. Besides that you can just pass the arguments as an object.</p>

<p>The following code uses the build-in date method:</p>

<pre><code>var gt = new Date().toISOString();

contentful.entries({
  content_type: content_Type,
  order: order,
  'fields.datum[gte]': gt
}).then(function () {
  // go ahead here...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Additional note:
Contentful will cache the result of queries based on the requested URLs. So if you don't need a high precision, I would suggest using timestamps which only reflects the current date or the respective hour of the day. E.g. <code>2015-07-28</code> or <code>2015-07-28T15:00</code></p>
