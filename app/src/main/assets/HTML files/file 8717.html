<p>Using the back button will use the cache as @kindall said.  It really depends on what you don't want cached.  </p>

<p>Instead of encouraging users from using the back button can you structure the page navigation so that the user can always get to where they want without having to use a back button?</p>

<p>The stuff you don't want cached can you load it dynamically via ajax?</p>
