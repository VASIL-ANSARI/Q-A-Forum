<p>RFC 3986 agrees with RFC 1738 (which it updates) in defining the query as a portion following a question mark (<code>?</code>), and in stating that a semicolon can be used to separate parameter-value pairs "applicable to that segment".</p>

<p>In a prospero URI (the only case given in RFC 1738 where a semicolon is shown used) semicolons indicate a parameter and parameter value in the path of the URI - not a query.</p>

<p>HTTP URIs do have semicolons used in their queries, but only after the <code>?</code>, e.g. <code>http://example.net/search?q=something;page=2</code>. Unfortunately actual usage has never quite replaced the <code>&amp;</code> character for this function and it is poorly supported by server-side code (including ASP.NET) which limits the ability of client-side code to adopt it (pretty much no browser does).</p>

<p>Still, In such cases the .NET Uri object correctly identifies only that portion following the <code>?</code> as a query, including semicolons if present. Its behaviour is correct.</p>
