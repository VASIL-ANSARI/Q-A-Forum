<p>Your issue is that the <code>head</code> of your linked list is a dummy. For input 1 2 3 4 you create this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0->1->2->3->4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When printing, you skip the first node.</p>

<p>But the <code>invert</code> method doesn't treat the head as a dummy. It reverts the list to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4->3->2->1->0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, since the printing method skips the head, the output you'll get is <code>3 2 1 0</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the fix:</p>

<pre><code>public static void invert(ListNode head)
{
    ListNode previous = null;
    ListNode current = head.link;
    ListNode forward;

    while (current != null)
    {
        forward = current.link;
        current.link = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = forward;
    }

    System.out.println("Here is the inverted list.");
    head.link = previous;
    printLinked(head);
}
</code></pre>
