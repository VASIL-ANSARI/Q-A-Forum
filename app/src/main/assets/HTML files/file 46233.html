<p>In the <code>Job</code> class there is a method called <code>#getTaskReports</code>.</p>

<p>You could use it that way to retrieve the map task duration:</p>

<pre><code>Job job = ...;
job.waitForCompletion(); 

TaskReport[] reports = job.getTaskReports(TaskType.MAP);
for(TaskReport report : reports) { 
   long time = report.getFinishTime() - report.getStartTime();
   System.out.println(report.getTaskId() + " took " + time + " millis!");
}
</code></pre>
