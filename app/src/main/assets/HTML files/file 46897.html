<p>Since the recyclerview item in xml doesn't depend on the kind of items that you will inflating in it, you can go ahead and use the same recycler view layout file for the three fragments.</p>

<p>As for the adapters, your lists seem to be homogeneous (i.e., single kind of view item). Its best that you use 3 different adapters for each case. You can customise the constructor, add custom helper methods for each kind of adapter as per your convenience.</p>

<p>Now if you have a heterogeneous list, you will have to override <code>getItemViewType()</code> in your adapter and use this appropriately in <code>onCreateViewHolder()</code> and <code>onBindViewHolder()</code></p>

<p>Hope this helps! :)</p>
