<p>The <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbcMetric" rel="nofollow">ABC Metric</a> is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>counting the number of assignments, branches and conditions for a section of code. The counting rules in the original C++ Report article were specifically for the C, C++ and Java languages, and defined as:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Assignment -- an explicit transfer of data into a variable, e.g. = *= /= %= += &lt;&lt;= >>= &amp;= |= ^= >>>= ++ --</p></li>
<li><p>Branch -- an explicit forward program branch out of scope -- a function call, class method call, or new operator</p></li>
<li><p>Condition -- a logical/Boolean test, == != &lt;= >= &lt; > else case default try catch ? and unary conditionals.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A scalar ABC size value (or "aggregate magnitude") is computed as:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>     |ABC| = sqrt((A*A)+(B*B)+(C*C))
</code></pre>

<p>This question is tagged <code>java</code> <code>c#</code> and <code>ruby</code> which have completely different syntax and coding styles so I don't think there is a one size fits all metric for this.</p>

<p>In general I would think you would want to keep the number in a "goldilocks" range of not too low and not too high.  The higher the threshold, the longer you allow your methods to be.  Longer methods are more complex, harder to understand and harder to test.  If you force all methods to be short, it is probably hard to read jumping to different sub-methods.</p>
