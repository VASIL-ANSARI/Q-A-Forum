<p>Yes and yes.</p>

<p>Don't fail the test by throwing an exception. <strong>Fail the test by failing the test</strong>.  Your test framework has a mechanism for asserting the condition being tested by the test. You bought this test framework, and now you are resisting using its features.  Use the test framework as it was designed to be used, or, if you don't like it, abandon it and choose a framework you like better. But don't do end-runs around its mechanisms.</p>

<p>Unexpected exceptions are not necessarily <em>test failures</em>; they could be <em>buggy tests</em>. You need to be able to tell the difference. The way you tell is: if the exception originates in the code under test, its a bug in the code. If it originates in the test code, its a bug in the test. And now you go and detect a bug in the code under test by making the testing code throw. And now it is harder to tell where the bug is.  Don't make your future self think that hard; don't write surprising code that deliberately avoids the conventions of the testing platform.</p>
