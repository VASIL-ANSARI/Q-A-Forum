<p>You can't really mix Razor and JavaScript like this. Razor runs on the server side, and JavaScript runs on the client side.  When the Razor is generating HTML on the server side, JavaScript is not available to you, and by the time the JavaScript is running on the client side, any Razor code is over and done with.</p>

<p>What you can do is use Razor to dump your model data into a JavaScript variable and then have your have your script use that once it's on the client side.  Check the link provided by @Deep in the comments to see one example of how to do this.</p>
