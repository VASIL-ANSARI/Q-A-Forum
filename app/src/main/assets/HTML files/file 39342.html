<p>it's much more readable as separate lines (especially if you line them up):</p>

<pre><code>SUCCESS  = 0
FAIL     = 0
TARGET   = os.getcwd()
TIMEOUT  = 2
MAXDEPTH = 0
ORIGINAL = ''
PATHS    = {}
</code></pre>

<p>But if you really want to do it in a single line, sure!</p>

<pre><code>SUCCESS, FAIL, TARGET, TIMEOUT, MAXDEPTH, ORIGINAL, PATHS = 0, 0, os.getcwd(), 2, 0, '', {}
</code></pre>
