<p>Static variables are allocated inside a code segment -- they are part of the executable image, and so are mapped in already initialized.</p>

<p>Static variables within function scope are treated the same, the scoping is purely a language level construct.</p>

<p>For this reason you are guaranteed that a static variable will be initialized to 0 (unless you specify something else) rather than an undefined value.</p>

<p>There are some other facets to initialization you can take advantage off -- for example shared segments allow different instances of your executable running at once to access the same static variables.</p>

<p>In C++ (globally scoped) static objects have their constructors called as part of the program start up, under the control of the C runtime library.  Under Visual C++ at least the order that objects are initialized in can be controlled by the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/104248" rel="nofollow">init_seg</a> pragma.</p>
