<p>I know there is something wrong, because <code>sizeof(struct ID3V2frame)</code> will return:</p>

<pre><code>sizeof(char[4]) + sizeof(char pointer) + sizeof(int[4])
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that the struct has a POINTER to a char, and a pointer is probably 4 bytes in your system. So you are fread()'ing the wrong size and in the wrong way.</p>

<p>I don't know about ID3 but somewhere in the header must be the size of this string.</p>

<p>Edit: Reading the doc</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ID3v2 frame overview</p>
  
  <p>As the tag consists of a tag header
  and a tag body with one or more
  frames, all the frames consists of a
  frame header followed by one or more
  fields containing the actual
  information. The layout of the frame
  header:</p>
  
  <p>Frame ID       $xx xx xx xx (four characters)</p>
  
  <p>Size           $xx xx xx xx</p>
  
  <p>Flags          $xx xx</p>
  
  <p>The frame ID is followed by a size
  descriptor, making a total header size
  of ten bytes in every frame. The size
  is calculated as frame size excluding
  frame header (frame size - 10).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your frame struct is wrong. </p>

<p>After you fixed your struct and have the proper total <code>size</code>, you can <code>fread()</code> <code>size-10</code> bytes to get the contents of the frame.</p>

<p>Be careful because you need to check the Frame ID to see if it's the Title's file name frame, since the spec says they can be in ANY order.</p>

<p>Please, refer to the docs. ID3v2 seem well documented. I was able to get all that info in 5mins.</p>
