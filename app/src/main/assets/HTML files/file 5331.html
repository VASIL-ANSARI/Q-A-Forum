<p>SplashScreen does not need to be a separate Activity since it does not handle user events. </p>

<p>Just put splash screen and mapview inside one activity. Use <code>FrameLayout</code> to position splash screen on top of mapview. </p>

<p>Start loading data when Activity starts (onCreate). Use AsyncTask to do network communication in the background while correctly updating view when data arrives.</p>

<p>Create <code>Handler</code> and call <code>postDelayed()</code> to dismiss splash screen after some time.</p>
