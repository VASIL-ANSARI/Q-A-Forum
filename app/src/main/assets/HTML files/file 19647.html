<p>You're missing the third parameter (<code>useCapture</code>) in some of your calls to <code>addEventListener()</code> but other than that nothing is obviously wrong. I know that Firefox has only started supporting <code>addEventListener()</code> without a third parameter within the last year, so it's possible IE 9 doesn't support it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>So much for that theory. Two parameters seems fine in IE 9: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/xZRy7/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/xZRy7/</a></p>
