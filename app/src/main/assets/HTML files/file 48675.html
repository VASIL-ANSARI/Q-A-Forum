<p>I faced the same problem, and it was because in the new Solution the NuGet Packages folder was in a different location relative to the project. To get around it I took the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy the project into the directory you want it to be in</li>
<li>Edit the csproj file so that all references to the Packages folder are correct relative to the new location</li>
<li>Add the project to the solution and build - packages will be restored</li>
</ol>
