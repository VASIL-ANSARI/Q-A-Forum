<p>I think the problem is in this line then <code>delete_item = Modelclass.objects.get(name=item['name'])</code></p>

<p>Try debugging that line first. If it's not that, maybe the item is not yielded from the spider. Spider doesn't throw any Exception if it fails to yield an item.</p>

<p>I've tried the delete function. It works.</p>
