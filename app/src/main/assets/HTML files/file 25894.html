<p>If you cannot change the method then you have to pass the value by other means</p>

<p>1) Property can be an option for you, have a property in C and let it be assigned from B.</p>

<p>2) Write overload method that accepts one more parameter and that would do the job for you, this way you dont have to change existing method that is being called from multiple places.</p>
