<p>You don't need a <code>CASE</code> statement. You can group by the result of integer division.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 10 * ( marks / 10 )     AS start_range,
       10 * ( marks / 10 ) + 9 AS end_range,
       count(*)                AS COUNT
FROM   testTable
GROUP  BY marks / 10 
</code></pre>

<p>This will group </p>

<pre><code>0  -  9
10 - 19
/* ...*/
90 - 99
100 - 109
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want <code>100</code> to be in a range on its own (as the only possible value in the end range) you need to define the requirements more clearly.</p>

<p>To include <strong>all</strong> ranges you can use</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CAST(10 * ( G.Grp ) AS VARCHAR(3)) + '-' 
                          + CAST(10 * ( G.Grp ) + 9 AS VARCHAR(3)) AS range,
       count(T.id)                                                 AS Count
FROM   (VALUES (0),(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)) G(Grp)
       LEFT JOIN [dbo].[testTable] T
         ON G.Grp = T.marks / 10
GROUP  BY G.Grp 
</code></pre>
