<p>Have a look at <a href="http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/" rel="nofollow">Python Development Environment on Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9</a>. </p>

<p>I followed these steps as well when trying to get Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 installed on OS X. It doesn't tell you how to install nose and distribute, but you should have a working environment and you can pick up from there.</p>

<p>I did have a problem using virtualenv and pip with Python 3, the question and solutions is available <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20952797/pip-installing-in-global-site-packages-instead-of-virtualenv">here</a>.</p>
