<p>This depends on what you are looking to do.  You can either navigate from MainPage.xaml to Top.xaml using</p>

<pre><code>NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("Top.xaml", UriKind.Relative));
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want to switch between layouts (i.e. not navigate to a whole new page) you can implement both layouts in one XAML page and switch between them using VisualStateManager.  Create one state called "Main" and other called "Top" then switch from one to the other as follows:</p>

<pre><code>VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Top", true);
</code></pre>

<p>It all depends on how you want to layout your code and also how you expect the back button to work.  Using states means you will have to handle the back button yourself.</p>
