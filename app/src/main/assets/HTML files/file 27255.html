<p>Firstly, you really don't need to put PHP tags on every line, just keep it all in one block. I think the best thing you can do, since the forums table probably won't contain too many rows is to select them all, then add condition as to what's displayed. Also, I'm assuming a forum with no group has an id of 0.</p>

<pre><code>$table = '';

$sql = "SELECT * FROM forums_forums ORDER BY order_number ASC";
$run = mysql_query($sql);
while($row = $mysql_fetch_assoc($run))
{
    if(($_GLOBALS['users']['team'] == 1 &amp;&amp; $row['admin_only']) || ($row['team'] &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $_GLOBALS['users']['team'] == $row['team']) || ($row['team'] == 0 &amp;&amp; $row['admin_only']))
    {
        $table .= '
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;'.$row['forum_name'].'&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;'.$row['replies'].'&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;'.$row['posts'].'&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;'.$row['forum_description'].'&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;';

    }
}

echo '&lt;table&gt;'.$table.'&lt;/table&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>Bear in mind though, this is a really nasty way of doing things. If you want cleaner, more navigatable code then look into templating. You can write a template class yourself without much difficultly. What you should be looking to do then is to have a template with all the HTML in a row, when repeat that row as often as you need it.</p>

<p>Also, you should take a look at some of the data types for your table. If admin_only can only be 1 or 0 for example, it should be a TINYINT with length of 1.</p>
