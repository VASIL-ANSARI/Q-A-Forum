<p>I'm not an Oracle guy, but apparently there's a command:</p>

<pre><code>set feedback off
</code></pre>

<p>which prevents it from returning the count of records affected.  Is this line in the stored procedure?  Or have you tried 'set feedback on'?  Functionally I think this is just the reverse of SQL Server's SET NOCOUNT ON/OFF command.</p>
