<p>If you changed some conditions (like offsets or frame) which would change your constraints, call setNeedsUpdateConstraints. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system will then call updateConstraints as part of its normal layout pass. Updating constraints all at once just before they are needed ensures that you donât needlessly recalculate constraints when multiple changes are made to your view in between layout passes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need any of the actions after updating constraints to have immediate effect, use layoutIfNeeded after it.</p>

<p>So you need to call setNeedsUpdateConstraints first and once that is done you need to call layoutIfNeeded as it forces the layout of subviews before drawing, so that changed constraints reflect accordingly in the view.</p>
