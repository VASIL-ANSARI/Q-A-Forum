<p>This is a pure hack that I have had to use when the client did not want to pay for the time to fix CSS. (note - it was not my code, I was hired to address an issue and uncovered the CSS problem.)</p>

<p>What I did was write correcting CSS and placed it so it was the last read and added an !important to override the other CSS code.</p>

<p>This is by no means the correct wad but it worked for me in a pinch.</p>
