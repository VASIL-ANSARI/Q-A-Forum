<p>Notice that <code>sharedobject</code> returns an object of Class1. You said that the <code>update</code> method only exists in Class2. Yet you have written <code>Class2 *obj = [self sharedobject];</code> and then tried to call <code>update</code> on it. You have called a method on an object of Class1 that doesn't exist in Class1. That is why you have received an unrecognized selector exception.</p>
