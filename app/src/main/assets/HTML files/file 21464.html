<p>You can force items to appear in the overflow menu by using <code>android:showAsAction="never"</code> in your menu XML. However, if your device has a hardware menu key, then the overflow won't display. You would have to do some fakery with a an item that you clicked, and dropped down a custom Context Menu or something. </p>

<p>I ran into this with my app too, and as much as I'd prefer to force it, it's probably best to go with the expected platform behavior and leave it to the menu button.</p>
