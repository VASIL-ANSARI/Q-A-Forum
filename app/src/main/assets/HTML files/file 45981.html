<p>If your whole applet is just one clickable area, I wouldn't use a <code>JButton</code> at all.  Just register a <code>MouseListener</code> on a <code>JPanel</code> and you're good to go.  <code>JButton</code> comes with a number of extra "features" like shading and hover behavior that's great in a GUI app, but not what you want in an applet who's sole purpose is to process a single click.</p>

<p>The problem you're running into is because you're using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/nimbus.html" rel="nofollow">Nimbus Look and Feel</a>. If you didn't know you were doing that, that's the problem with auto-generating code - it does things you didn't ask it to.</p>

<p>The documentation for <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#setBorder-javax.swing.border.Border-" rel="nofollow"><code>.setBorder()</code></a> mentions this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although technically you can set the border on any object that inherits from JComponent, the look and feel implementation of many standard Swing components doesn't work well with user-set borders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your attempts to overwrite the border aren't doing anything because you asked Swing to use the Nimbus LaF.</p>

<p><strong>Easy fix:</strong> don't use the Nimbus LaF; just delete the Nimbus-related code from <code>init()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Better fix:</strong> don't use a <code>JButton</code>, use a <code>JPanel</code> to listen for clicks and a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1242581/display-a-jpg-image-on-a-jpanel"><code>JLabel</code> to display your image</a>.  You don't <em>want</em> the behavior of a <code>JButton</code>, so don't use it.  This is a little more effort (you have to center the <code>JLabel</code>) but it's the "right" way to do it, and you can basically turn <code>jButton1</code> into a <code>JLabel</code> and your code will work.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of what I ended up seeing:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j4ZmY.png" alt="Screenshot of three different versions of the applet; original, Nimbus-disabled, and JLabel instead of JButton"></p>

<p>I didn't bother tweaking the layout and color of the <code>JLabel</code> solution so it doesn't look as nice, but you can see there's no borders on either the second or third applet.</p>
