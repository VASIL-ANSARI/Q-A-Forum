<p>About a year ago when I was looking into open source ASP.NET content management apps, I found that DotNetNuke was one of the better solutions. I know there are a lot of 3rd party modules for DNN available from places like <a href="http://www.snowcovered.com/Snowcovered2/" rel="nofollow">Snowcovered.com</a>, so I'm willing to bet you can find a storefront/ecommerce module that will meet your needs. Most of the modules are pretty cheap, &lt; $100.</p>

<p>Another option that I have used in the past is <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/starter-kits/the-beer-house/" rel="nofollow">TheBeerHouse</a> starter site, straight from www.asp.net. The site includes a storefront, and some more stuff like forums, content rating, and self registration.</p>
