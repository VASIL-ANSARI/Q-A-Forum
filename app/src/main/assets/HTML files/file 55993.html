<p>You access <code>example.com/blog/1/anything</code>, and redirected to <code>example.com/blog/1/my-slug-from-database</code>. Now in CI, you get to the same function, and then because <code>$slug</code> is true, you are redirected again to <code>example.com/blog/1/my-slug-from-database</code>. You have a redirection loop - that is what causing the The page isn't redirecting properly error.</p>

<p>You need a way to stop the redirection - as far as I can see from your code, check if <code>$slug === $get_title</code>, and if so - don't redirect. But it's really hard to know what to do, because I'm not sure what you attempt to do.</p>
