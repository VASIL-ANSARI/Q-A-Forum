<p>Sure, you can do it within the same GUI. If you want to prevent user from clicking the <code>pbutton1</code> buton before loading the file you can set its attribute <code>disabled</code> to <code>True</code> and enable the button after the file is loaded (for example when calling <code>button2Pressed</code> function). I don't see any file loading instruction in your code, so the first thing to do for you will be saving the file content in your object, so in your <code>button2Pressed</code> you need something like:</p>

<pre><code>with open(self.lineedit1.text(), 'r') as my_file:
    self.file_content = my_file.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you have your file loaded you need to count the words. <code>readlines</code> splits the file into separate lines so you will also have to perform a loop to count all the words, so in <code>button1Pressed</code> you can write for example:</p>

<pre><code>self.word_counter = 0
for line in self.file_content:
    for word in line.split(' ')
        if word == self.lineedit2.text():
            counter +=1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above code only splits your lines into words on a whitespace (<code>' '</code>). If you want commas and other symbols to be removed consider using <code>regex</code>. I hope this will give you an idea. Cheers!</p>
