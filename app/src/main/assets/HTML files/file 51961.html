<p><strong>1. Install Homebrew</strong></p>

<p>â¢ Package manager for Mac, allows you to download pretty much anything with
one Terminal command. Follow steps <a href="http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-homebrew-on-os-x-el-capitan-10-11-package-manager-for-unix-apps/">here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>2. Install Eigen</strong></p>

<p>â¢ Simply run the following command in Terminal: <code>brew install eigen</code></p>

<p>â¢ Eigen is now installed.</p>

<p>â¢ Make note of the file path that is printed out on the command line! You'll need that later and it can vary from person to person.</p>

<p>â¢ Homebrew saves Eigen files in <code>/usr/local/include/eigen3/</code></p>

<p><strong>3. Include Eigen files in your Xcode projectâs Build Path</strong></p>

<p>â¢ Open the project you want to use Eigen with.</p>

<p>â¢ Select your projectâs build target under TARGETS</p>

<p>â¢ Select the Build Settings tab.</p>

<p>â¢ Scroll down to Apple LLVM 7.0 - Custom Compiler Flags <em>Note that your version of the LLVM compiler may be different.</em></p>

<p>â¢ Double click the blank space to the right of Other C++ Flags.</p>

<p>â¢ Add the directory where Eigen files are located in the filepath you noted back in step 2 (<code>-I &lt;filepath&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>â¢ Search for HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS in your target build settings and add <code>/usr/local/include/eigen3/</code> the same way you added the Eigen file path to <code>OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS</code>.</p>

<p>Your project should be able to use Eigen with no issues now. </p>
