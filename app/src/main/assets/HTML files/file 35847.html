<p>I faced this problem before and solved it by using OnSeekCompleteListener:</p>

<p><code>mMediaPlayer.setOnSeekCompleteListener(new OnSeekCompleteListener() {
    public void onSeekComplete(MediaPlayer mp) {
        //Your stuff
}});</code></p>

<p>I don't know if it's the best way to solve this, but it worked for me.</p>

<p>Edit: BTW, I use both listeners, oncompletionlistener AND onseekcompletelistener. Hope this helps!</p>
