<p>Hmmm...all seems to have worked fine for me. Just tried it. </p>

<p>Are you sure you followed the <strong>Nginx</strong> instructions instead of the <strong>Apache</strong> instructions?</p>

<p>Make sure you do the soft link and change the 'root' application...the instructions say to make it the absolute path minus the 'public' part:</p>

<p>http {
    ...</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name g.local;
    root /home/bernie/development/test;  &lt;- forgot to change this the first time I tried
    passenger_enabled on;   
    passenger_base_uri /rails; 
}

...
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Here's an image of the end result...no route modifications needed:</p>
