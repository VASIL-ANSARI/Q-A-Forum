<p>No, the iPhone camera is fixed focal length (<a href="http://falklumo.blogspot.com/2010/06/apple-iphone-4-camera-specs.html">5.4mm for the iPhone 4</a>) and cannot zoom - perhaps you mean <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/forums/thread2456.htm">focal distance</a> which is the distance from the lens at which an image is in focus?  If you mean focal distance, then this answer is of no use to you. :-(</p>

<p>If you want to <em>simulate</em> the effect of different focal length (i.e. zoom), you can simply crop the image, although your cropped image will be of lower resolution than the uncropped original.</p>

<p>The iPhone 4 has a real focal length of 5.4mm, and a full-frame equivalent focal length of 29.4mm.  Your desired 120mm focal length is also full-frame equivalent.</p>

<p>120/29.4 is about 4.  So crop out the middle 1/4 (25%) of the height and width of the iPhone photo using your application, and you have simulated the Field of View of a 120mm lens.</p>

<p>The iPhone 4 takes photos at 2592x1936, so the cropped photo will be 648x484.  That's approximately VGA resolution.</p>
