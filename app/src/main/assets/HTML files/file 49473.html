  <p>How does the make process find the location of header files? </p>

<p>It doesn't and it doesn't need to. It's the <em>compiler</em>* that needs to find them, and it does so by you telling it where to look when you configure the <em>include search paths</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is their any environmental variable like INCLUDE to give the search path of all the header files which will be checked by make process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is based on the compiler, not make. If your compiler checks any environment variables for include search paths then you could set that before running make.</p>

<p>However typically you instead set a variable in your Makefile and then use that variable in your compilation rules:</p>

<pre><code>INC=-I/usr/informix/incl/c++ /opt/informix/incl/public

main:   test.cpp
        gcc -Wall $(LIB) $(INC) -c test.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above shows you how to put the include paths in a compile command, but it's not showing best practices: the dependencies aren't right so make will not always know it needs to rebuild the target when it should. I haven't looked at it in detail, but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21413195/how-can-i-make-my-makefiles-better">this</a> question and answer may help you with producing robust makefiles.</p>

<p>* Well, preprocessor really, but with modern toolchains this is embedded in the compiler executable or invoked by the compiler driver automatically.</p>
