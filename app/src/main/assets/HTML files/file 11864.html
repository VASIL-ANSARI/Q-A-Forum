<p>Perhaps you should consider subclassing UITextField instead. Then each instance of your custom UITextField will know how to adorn itself (through methods you define in your subsclass). In your view controllers that use your custom text field, you can call these custom methods in <code>viewDidLoad:</code> or where ever it makes the most sense.</p>
