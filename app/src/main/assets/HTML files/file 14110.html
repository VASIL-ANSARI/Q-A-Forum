<p>The error you are referring to is because integer 0 is an invalid value for the type in question? Also, if the thing_instance is already in the persisted connected state, you do not need to add it to a session! Also, a <code>session.commit()</code> most probably is not what you really want here, maybe you meant <code>session.flush()</code>?</p>
