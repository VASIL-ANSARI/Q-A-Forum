<p>Either <code>obj.instance_variable_set("@instance_variable", value)</code> or <code>obj.send("instance_variable=", value)</code>.</p>

<p>The former directly sets the instance variable. The latter calls the setter method, which of course only works if there is a setter method, but on the other hand also works if you have a setter method that doesn't actually only set an instance variable (or doesn't set an instance variable at all).</p>
