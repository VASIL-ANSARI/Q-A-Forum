<p>These days there is no noticeable difference since we have optimized serializers for ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap. That way you get the almost same benefit as handwriting it.</p>

<p>The ArrayList serializer classes can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/serialization/impl/ArrayListStreamSerializer.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/internal/serialization/impl/ArrayListStreamSerializer.java</a></p>

<p>Looking at the code you'll see, that it'll give you almost the same benefit.</p>
