<p>When you are using the webkit version of the CSS rule, for example in <em>line 26</em>, use <strong>-webkit-transition</strong> in the property to undergo transition instead of simply transform.</p>

<p>Also, you forgot the webkit version in <em>line 31</em>(not an error just pointing it out).</p>

<p>Also, it is working here, but the transition is not very smooth, so is that what you are asking us to help you with?</p>
