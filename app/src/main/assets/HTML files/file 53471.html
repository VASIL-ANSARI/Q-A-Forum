<p>You can't achieve this just in client side itself. Because once notification arrives it is handled by iOS and displayed in notification centre (or any other type as per user setting). App will not get the notification info, unless it is running. </p>

<p>You can have this as settings in Client and sync it with server to have a check there before pushing the notifications.</p>
