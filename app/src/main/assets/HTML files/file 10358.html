<p>If I understand correctly, <code>make_shared</code> is new in C++11 and is in namespace <code>std</code>, but it is only available if you compile with <code>-std=gnu++0x</code> or similar. But if you do that, then <code>shared_ptr</code> is also in <code>std</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is another version of <code>shared_ptr</code> in <code>std::tr1</code>, but in C++11 mode you should not use it: it should be considered <em>deprecated</em>.</p>

<p>Your solution is simply to remove every use of <code>tr1</code> and use the full C++11 version of these classes.</p>
