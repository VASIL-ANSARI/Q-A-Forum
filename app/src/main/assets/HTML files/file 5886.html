<p>For empty label in forms you could do this - </p>

<pre><code>class SomeForm(forms.Form):
    h=forms.CharField(label=u'',widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'value':'Search'}))
</code></pre>

<p>By keeping <code>label</code> as '', you get the label as empty. The <code>attrs</code> are basically the HTML attributes of the form text field.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I didn't understand the first part of your Q, elaborate...</p>
