<p>RESTful systems leverage existing technologies already available rather then re-implement them. And since HTTP already contains authentication support in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" rel="nofollow">Basic Authentication</a>, you should just re-use that. It's a widely-supported mechanism for clients to transmit their credentials.</p>

<p>And yes, the client should send their credentials with each request. Cookies are for human clients who don't like to type in their password repeatedly, and that's not the case here. Cookies imply session statefulness on your server and that can make scalability very difficult.</p>

<p>There are probably a hundred questions on this site about RESTful authentication. I'd encourage you to search for and read the more popular ones.</p>
