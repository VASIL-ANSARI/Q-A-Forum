<p>You should use C99 whenever you are not locked in an environment that doesn't support C99 (embeded systems most notably).</p>

<p>And yes, if you know that your library will be used by people that are using MSVC, you can't use C99 features in the interfaces, but there is no reason not to use C99 in the implementation (apart from library feature dependencies of course).</p>

<p>Original answer: "Uh? What compilers don't support C99? Plus when you move from compilers to tools, C99 is actually more commonly supported then C89."</p>
