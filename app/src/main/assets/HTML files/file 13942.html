<p>yes you can create/load images to the Mutable array and that of 2nd part, you may also access the ivars of class in background thread, you don't need to use main thread if that is not UIKit's data like imageview etc. but if it is, you can use </p>

<pre><code>[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(loadPersonView) withObject:imageArray waitUntilDone:YES];
</code></pre>
