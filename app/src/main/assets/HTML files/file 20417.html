<p>I think that when you are using an observable in a test condition, you need to call it properly, as otherwise what you asking it to resolve is whether visible is a truthy condition in js, which a function is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul data-bind="foreach: items"&gt;
    &lt;li data-bind="style: { color: visible() ? 'red' : 'black'} "&gt;X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to fix it for me in your jsFiddle.</p>
