<p>I assume you are talking about responsive web design </p>

(I learned a lot from here)</p>

<p>This basiclly makes the website respond to the window/device size. You can do this by making a website then using media queries. For example</p>

<p>Html file</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="color"&gt; Hello &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS file</p>

<pre><code>color {color: blue;}

@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {
color {color: red;}
       } 
</code></pre>

<p>This would make it so when the width of device/window will reach 800px it will change "Hello" to red instead of blue.
But this is just a small example, you can do much more after knowing the basics!</p>
