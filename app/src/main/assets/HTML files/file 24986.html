<p>The term "deadlock" describes a very specific thing, two threads waiting for access to a resource that is locked by the other. There is no indication that this is what is happening in your case (or is there?), so what exactly is it that you are experiencing? Also, what exactly is it that you want to achieve with multithreading?</p>

<p>In any case, keep the UI in a single thread, use SendMessage() &amp; Co to notify that thread of any events occurring in background threads. Alternatively, you can also use a timer to poll for certain state changes. That way, you are on the safe side and your application shouldn't lock up (at least not because of using the UI from different threads).</p>

<p>To be a bit more precise, you have to keep the message loop for a window and all its child windows in a single thread. You can create multiple windows and handle each of them from their own thread, but don't mix calls. In practice, this distinction isn't important though, because few applications create multiple windows (and no, e.g. a message box or other dialogs don't count).</p>
