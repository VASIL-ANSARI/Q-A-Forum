<p>Maybe your timer is getting garbage collected or otherwise freed perhaps by the autorelease pool, and hence does not fire anymore.</p>

<p>Try doing this:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)recordCam1:(id)sender {
    myTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1 target:self selector:@selector(recordFile1:) userInfo:Nil repeats:YES];
    [myTimer retain];
}
</code></pre>

<p>where myTimer is an instance variable in your class. See if that produces a different behaviour. If so, then you know the problem is to do with memory management.</p>
