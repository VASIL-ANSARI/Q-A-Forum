<p>Classes are loaded only when they are first used. Thus your class will not be loaded at launch time but rather at the first time something from this class (including a static method, type declaration, etc.) is needed. Thus, the default behavior is that loading as delayed as long as possible.</p>

<p>If you want to control the loading time you can load the class explicitly via ClassLoaer.loadClass(). If your class is wrapped with some interface, you can have the code access only on the interface (thus ensuring the class is not loaded by some chain of dependencies) and then load it (ClassLoader.loadclass()) &amp; instantiate it when you actually need an instance of this class.</p>
