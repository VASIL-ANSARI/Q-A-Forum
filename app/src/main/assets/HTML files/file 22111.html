<p>Can create very fast a full site that handle your database manipulations. 
Its not free, and you stick with what ever he gives you, but is not that bad for quick tool.</p>

<p>From the other, do you ever hear the <strong>scaffold</strong> ?</p>

<p>I have use the SubSonic ver 2, that have scaffold, but other DAL have also.
What this technique do is to automatic create the editing forms for your.</p>

<p>you can search on google for "scaffold asp.net"</p>

<p>So you can select a DAL that have scaffold and use that.</p>
