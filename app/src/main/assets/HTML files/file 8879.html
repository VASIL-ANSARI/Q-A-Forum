<p>You should probably not create multiple arrays but create an array of dictionaries. So create a mutable array called counties or wtv and ads dictionaries that contain the title, name, etc. To create a dictionary it is quite easy just create an <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> object and then use the <code>setValue:forKey:</code> metod to add things to it. For the country name, the value would be the name and the key would by country. Hope that helps. </p>
