<p>You basically first have to scan parts of or the whole, file for the word you are looking for and then append the word if it doesn't exist. </p>

<p>You could use <code>readLine()</code>, however if you don't mind a third party lib you might try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" rel="nofollow">Guava</a>:</p>

<pre><code>File theFile = ...
String theWord = ...

String text = Files.toString(theFile, "utf-8");
if (!text.contains(theWord)) {
   Files.append(theWord,  theFile, "utf-8")
}
</code></pre>
