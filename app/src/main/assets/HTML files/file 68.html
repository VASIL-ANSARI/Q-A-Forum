<p>Your assumption is right, this is the optimal way to do it and it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsert">upsert/merge</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/T-SQL/61773/">Importance of UPSERT - from sqlservercentral.com</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.</p>
  
  <p>The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.</p>
