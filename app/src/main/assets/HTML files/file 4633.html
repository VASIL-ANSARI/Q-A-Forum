<p>I usually start these kinds of worker threads indirectly from a Servlet using the method you describe (usually they exist inside some other object that does the queue extraction and controls the processing).</p>

<p>For pulling objects off the thread, you don't need to do it based on time, you could have your thread wait() on the queue object and when an object is put onto the queue by some other thread, that thread would call notify() on the queue to release the watching 'worker' thread.</p>

<p>Google 'java worker thread wait notify' for many examples.</p>
