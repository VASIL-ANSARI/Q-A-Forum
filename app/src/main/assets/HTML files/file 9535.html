<p>When working with Google App Engine you will need a pure Python library because you can't install anything that's compiled (eg. Cairo). While there are pure Python libraries for creating SVG files (eg. <a href="http://codeboje.de/pysvg/" rel="nofollow">pySVG</a>) I don't think there are any for rasterizing SVG images.</p>
