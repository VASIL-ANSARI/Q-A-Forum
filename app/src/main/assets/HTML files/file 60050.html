<p>ABI splits can be useful if you use them one at a time. Here's an example: </p>

<pre><code>android {  
...
    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include  'armeabi-v7a'
        }
    }
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting .apk file will only contain the libraries necessary for armeabi-v7a devices, because it's the only architecture mentioned in the ABI splits configuration above. The ABIs available are 'arm64-v8a', 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86' as pointed out in the <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/publishing/publishing-android-apps#apks-with-abi-splits" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, so you can't use 'armeabi' or 'mips' architectures.</p>

<p>Furthermore you don't need this line: 'universalApk true', because what it does is ignoring the splits and making one .apk file containing all the provided architectures and you want the opposite.</p>

<p>You can also follow the progress of <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime/issues/529" rel="nofollow">this</a> issue as it will decrease the .apk size even more.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
