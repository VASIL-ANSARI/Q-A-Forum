<p>I already notice the reason that was causing the failure in galaxy s4 and galaxy note 2. An unexpected service coming from the phone was asking for connection in the middle of the protocol. Since the original seeedstudio library did not validated this case the whole protocol failed. I fix the llcp protocol flow bypassing this service request and now it works properly.
