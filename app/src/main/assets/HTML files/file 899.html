<p>I use the Eldos <a href="http://eldos.com/cbfs/" rel="nofollow">Callback File System</a> myself for this purpose, but although it's good, it's not exactly cheap.</p>

<p>There are some free/cheap projects as well, and I'm sure one of them was mentioned in a similar question on SO recently -- can't find it anymore at the moment, though. Stability tends to be a major issue, though, as layered Windows file system drivers aren't trivial.</p>
