<p>I think your problem is the while condition. Your program isn't running for 10min, but for about 30secs (<code>DWORD  entry=GetTickCount() + 30000</code>). Then the condition <code>entry &gt; tickes</code> is met and the loop aborts. And in this short time, your app just managed to write 80 bmp's. If you want it to run 10 minutes the number must be not <code>30000</code> but <code>600000</code> (10min * 60 * 1000 = 600000ms)</p>
