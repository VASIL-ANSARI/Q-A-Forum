<p>The parameter to <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/socket#socket.socket.recv" rel="nofollow"><code>socket.recv</code></a> only specifies the maximum buffer size for receiving data packages, it doesn't mean exactly that many bytes will be read.</p>

<p>So if you write:</p>

<pre><code>strng = sc.recv(int(size))
</code></pre>

<p>you won't necessarily get all the content, specially if <code>size</code> is rather large.</p>

<p>You need to read from the socket in a loop until you have actually read <code>size</code> bytes to make it work.</p>
