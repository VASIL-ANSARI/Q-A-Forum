<p>First, array bounds are not checked at runtime or at compile time.  Be careful out there.</p>

<p>Second, your second case gives an error because you have a mismatch in array dimension - you're using three subscript operators (<code>[]</code>) on a 2D array.  Just because the array happens to be laid out in memory as an array of arrays doesn't mean there is any actual type changing going on with the variable.</p>

<p>Array subscripting is described in the C standard section <strong>6.5.2.1 Array subscripting</strong>.</p>
