<p>Quite simply, this is because <code>jQuery.support</code> was <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/" rel="nofollow">introduced in 1.3</a></p>

<p>In versions prior to 1.3, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/" rel="nofollow"><code>jQuery.browser</code></a> was used to browser sniff, rather than feature detect. It has since been depreciated. </p>

<p>jQuery 1.2.6 will celebrate it's <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Release%3ajQuery_1.2.6" rel="nofollow">4th birthday next year</a>. You should <em>seriously</em> consider <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update" rel="nofollow">upgrading to a newer version</a>.</p>
