<p>The short answer is yes. More processes will also result in getting more CPU time.</p>

<p>The default assumption of a typical scheduler on a modern operating system is that anything that asks for CPU time intends to use the CPU to make useful forward progress and it's generally more important to make as much forward progress as possible than to be "fair". If you have some notion of fairness that's important to your particular workload, you can specifically configure it in most operating systems.</p>
