  <p>Is this better then visual c++ winform application?</p>

<p>No, it's different.  "Better" depends on your goals.</p>

<p>A Windows Forms application will be a C++/CLI application, and use .NET.  This may be "easier" for developing a GUI appilcation, but adds a lot of complexity and dependencies.</p>

<p>A Win32 application will not take a dependency on .NET, but then you can't use the .NET types.  For details on what you can make when choosing that option, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2zy4kwk%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN's Win32 Application documentation</a>.</p>
