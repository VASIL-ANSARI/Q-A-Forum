<p>Seems like you're trying to call any UI widget from <code>doInBackground()</code> method which is not directly possible since AsyncTask is worker thread not UI thread. So you will need to call <code>runOnUiThread()</code> method in your <code>doInBackground()</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>activity.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        Toast.makeText(activity, "Hello", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
</code></pre>
