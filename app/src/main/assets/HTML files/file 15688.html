<p>This can happen when there are two statements on a line, and the inner statement is without source (such as a bare bones JRE).</p>

<pre><code>myObject.myMethod(someObject.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>In this line, the first step-into, will step into the toString() Method on inner object (for which there may be no source available), the second step into will step into your own method (for which there will be code).</p>

<p>The way to resolve this (if it is happening for regular Java Runtime Classes) is to use a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u32-downloads-1594644.html" rel="nofollow">full JDK</a> for your project rather than a JRE and to follow good coding practise and move the inner statement into a variable so that each line does exactly one thing (the optimizer should ensure there is no performance penalty for doing this).</p>
