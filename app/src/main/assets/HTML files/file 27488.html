<p>I guess you're extending <code>FragmentActivity</code> and using classes from compatibility package. When calling setup, you're probably calling it like this:</p>

<pre><code>setup(this, getFragmentManager(), containerId);
</code></pre>

<p>Call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>setup(this, getSupportFragmentManager(), containerId);
</code></pre>

<p>This answer is based on assumptions - since you didn't provide more details about how you're calling setup and what are your parent classes.</p>
