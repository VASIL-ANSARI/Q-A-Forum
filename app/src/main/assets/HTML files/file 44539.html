<p>Here is some pseudo-code:
<code>
c = getchar()
num = 0
while isdigit(c)
   num = (num * 10) + (c - '0')
   c = getchar()
</code></p>

<p>This accumulates the number, recognizing that each new digit to the right effectively multiplies the digits seen already by 10.  It stops accumulating when a non-digit is seen, so parsing strings like <strong>91+3</strong> works.</p>
