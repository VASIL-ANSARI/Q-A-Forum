<p>You are trying to do a <code>@Autowired private KeywordDao keywordDao;</code> but you not getting any autowiring error. but <code>@Autowired</code> is by default <code>@Autowired(required=true)</code> meaning that these dependencies are by default mandatory, and throw an error if not met.</p>

<p>No autowiring error is received, so the conclusion is that it seems that this class is not being scanned for autowiring at all. </p>

<p>If it would then an error would be thrown. Try to see why the class is not being autowired, here are some common causes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the package where the class is placed is not being scanned, is the name of the classes package util or a subpackage?</p></li>
<li><p>The scanning is being done in the wrong spring context. Most Spring applications have two contexts, one root context and one servlet dispatcher context. Try to move the component scan <code>&lt;context:component-scan base-package="util"/&gt;</code> from one context to the other, by copying this configuration line from one XML file to the other.</p></li>
</ul>
