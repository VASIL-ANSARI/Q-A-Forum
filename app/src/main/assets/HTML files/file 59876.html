<p>Maybe you're using local IP when connected to WiFi or a local scan or something and you have something like <code>192.168.1.102</code> , you'll need to use your public IP, the one your Internet provider assigns you.
Then, that connection will get to your router, if you need specific port connection, your router will have to forward that for you to the target device</p>
