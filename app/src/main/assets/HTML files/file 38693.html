<p>The problem is that your <strong>path</strong> begins with 2 slashes, so it's currently <code>//reset/Nw/3u5-5654a2cadfa432b86577/</code> (when your path begins with just 1 slash, Django doesn't use the first one to match against your pattern, which is why the "URL" it's showing you in the error message only begins with 1 slash).</p>

<p>You probably have something like this in your code: <code>&lt;domain&gt;/{{ obj.path }}</code></p>

<h3>Solution:</h3>

<p>Remove the extra slash from the path you're returning, which will result in the path being <code>/reset/Nw/3u5-5654a2cadfa432b86577/</code>.</p>
