<p>Re-entrant safety means that the function can successfully handle an "out of context" call to itself while it is executing. In non-kernel code in modern operating systems, this usually means that another thread will be calling it at the same time so in this case it is equivalent to being thread-safe.</p>

<p>However, e.g. in MS-DOS or in kernel code, an interrupt could occur at any time while the function is executing, possibly invoking the function on its own; this could have strange side-effects unless the function is written specifically to avoid this.</p>
