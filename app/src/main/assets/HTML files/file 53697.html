<p><a href="http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#infer" rel="nofollow">http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#infer</a> seems like a good lead:</p>

<pre><code>infer.findRefs(ast: AST, scope: Scope, name: string, refScope: Scope, f: fn(AST, Scope))
Will traverse the given syntax tree, using scope as the starting scope, looking for references to variable name that resolve to scope refScope, and call f with the node of the reference and its local scope for each of them.

infer.findPropRefs(ast: AST, scope: Scope, objType: Obj, propName: string, f: fn(AST))
Analogous to findRefs, but used to look for references to a specific property instead. Whereas findRefs is precise, this is dependent on type inference, and thus can not be relied on to be precise.
