<p>How did you upgrade? It looks like your <code>config/boot.rb</code> is unchanged, which means it will attempt to load Rails 2.3.5. There are <strong>significant</strong> changes in the files in the <code>config</code> directory between Rails 2 and 3.</p>

<p>In my experience it's easier to create a new Rails 3 application, and copy all functionality (models, controllers, views, tests, ...) to this new application. It'll save you trouble and can be done very quickly.</p>
