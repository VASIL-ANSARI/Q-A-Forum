<p>Ah, hello again.</p>

<p>I've answered this elsewhere, <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=13596" rel="nofollow">http://www.red-gate.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=13596</a>, however the answer is spread over several posts so, just to summarise:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reflector 5.x and 6.x add-ins can be loaded unmodified in Reflector 7 as of build 7.2.0.134, which I put out as an early access build today. You can get this from the bottom of the homepage at <a href="http://www.reflector.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reflector.net/</a>. I anticipate that we'll release .NET Reflector 7.2 for real within the next 10 days or so.</li>
<li>You can find out why an add-in failed to load by double-clicking on the add-in name in the error box that appears - this is well hidden and is something we'll make more obvious in the future.</li>
</ol>
