<p>You are setting the delegate of the <code>ThirdViewController</code> in the the <code>SecondViewController</code>.m to self</p>

<pre><code>objthirdView.delegate=self;
</code></pre>

<p>this means that the delegate of the <code>ThirdViewController</code> is the <code>SecondViewController</code> and not the <code>FirstViewController</code>. Keep a reference to the <code>FirstViewController</code> in the <code>SecondViewController</code> and use it as the delegate like this.</p>

<pre><code>objthirdView.delegate=myFirstViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming it is not possible to pop from <code>ThirdViewController</code> to the <code>FirstViewController</code> you can maybe misuse the <code>SecondViewController</code> for passing the data back to the <code>FirstViewController</code> via delegate methods you already implemented. But I would not recommend it - it is not a good design.</p>
