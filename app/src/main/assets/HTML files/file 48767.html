<p>The redirect is probably cancelling the AJAX request that has been queued, but not yet sent. Try doing the redirect after a timeout, to give the second AJAX call a chance to be sent.</p>

<pre><code>$.post(ajaxEndpoint, dataObject)
  .done(function(response) {
    if (response.status === 'success') {
      // Send data to process asynchronously
      otherApiCall(response.otherData);

      // Redirect to the thank you page
      setTimeout(function() {
        window.location.replace(getThankYouUrl());
      }, 10);
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure how reliable this is, though. Perhaps a better solution would be to perform the redirect when the second AJAX call goes to <code>readystate == 3</code>, which means the server is processing the request. There's no jQuery interface to this, so you'll probably have to do it using the low-level <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> interface.</p>
