<p>I think your problem might be that when you are connecting with your local host, you are using the http protocol. If that's the case, then it would make sense that a frame with a higher security (https) can't be accessed from a http frame. Try deploying to heroku, which will be https, and see if that solves your problem. Hope that helps!</p>
