<p>That white patch on top was actually the Navigation Bar of the iphone. I understood this when accidentally using Title property in Xamarin Forms XAML page. 
Using below code has hidden it &amp; made the app look full screen. </p>

<pre><code>  //Hide Nav Bar 
        NavigationPage.SetHasNavigationBar(this, false);
</code></pre>
