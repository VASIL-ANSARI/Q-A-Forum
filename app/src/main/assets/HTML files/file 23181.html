<p>What you're looking for is <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_count-distinct" rel="nofollow">COUNT(DISTINCT)</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT: according to your comments, You should try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(DISTINCT oi.id) as itemCount, 
       concat(a.firstname, ' ', a.lastname) as name, 
       oi.status, a.id as adminID, 
       (SELECT count(oi2.id) as oldItemsCount 
               FROM bl_orderitems oi2, 
                    bl_researcher r2
               WHERE oi2.status='Pending' AND 
                     r2.id=oi.researcherid AND 
                     r2.researchermanagerid=a.id AND
                     DATE(oi2.regdate)=DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY))
               as oldItemCount
FROM bl_orderitems oi, 
       bl_researcher r,
       tbladmins a 
WHERE oi.status in ('Pending', 'QA') AND
       r.id=oi.researcherid AND 
       r.researchermanagerid=a.id 
GROUP BY 
      name, adminID, oi.status;
</code></pre>

<p>It's simpler and may fit your needs.</p>
