<p>It sounds like your file isn't being parsed as PHP. I bet if you look in the source, <code>&lt;?php echo "hello"; ?&gt;</code> will be there, in plain text. Make sure your host supports PHP, and name your file appropriately to get it to be parsed as PHP (eg, with <code>.php</code> extension).</p>

<p>If you're testing this locally, you can use PHP's <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php" rel="nofollow">built-in web server</a>. From command line (replacing <code>~/public_html</code> with the path to your code):</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/public_html
php -S localhost:8000
</code></pre>

<p>Then, open <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in your browser.</p>
