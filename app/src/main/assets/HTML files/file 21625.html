<p>When you create a <code>FileStream</code> you don't load it's data to the memory.
when you are seeking the stream, the file content is still read from the disk - a good thing to do when you need to read big files.</p>

<p>If all you want to do is to load the whole content to memory you can use <code>File.ReadAllBytes</code>.
You can read more about it here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.readallbytes.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.readallbytes.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>Note: If you want to use a stream and not a byte array, you can use <code>MemoryStream</code> and pass the read file content to it.</p>
