<p>i don't know why you'd want the content of the file since getScript executes it after loading it &amp; the call back is just a callback to if necesary call functions/plugins/whatever you have just loaded;
if you want content of a file do <code>$.get</code> instead but anyway </p>

<pre><code>do 
function(data, textStatus, jqxhr) {
    console.log(data); //data returned
    console.log(textStatus); //success
    console.log(jqxhr.status); //200
    console.log('Load was performed.');
  });
</code></pre>

<p>to spot the "problem" if any (from <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/</a>)</p>
