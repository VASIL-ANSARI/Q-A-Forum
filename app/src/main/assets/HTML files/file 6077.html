<p>It's impossible to tell, for any environment.  You do not define the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the memory locations of <code>DestVar</code> and <code>Value</code>?  On the heap or on the stack?  If they are on the stack, then it is thread safe, as there is not another thread that can access that memory location.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>DestVar</code> and <code>Value</code> are on the heap, then are they reference types or value types (have copy by assignment semantics).  If the latter, then it is thread safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Does <code>CAS</code> synchronize access to itself?  In other words, does it have some sort of mutual exclusion strucuture that has allows for only <em>one</em> call at a time?  If so, then it is thread-safe.</p></li>
<li><p>If <em>any</em> of the conditions mentioned above are untrue, then it is <em>indeterminable</em> whether or not this is all thread safe.  With more information about the conditions mentioned above (as well as whether or not this is C++ or C#, <strong>yes, it does matter</strong>) an answer can be provided.</p></li>
</ul>
