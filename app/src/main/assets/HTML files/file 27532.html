<p>Thanks for the comments... I was gonna do a jsfiddle but the site was temporarily down... It is back now, but I solved the issue. The issue was this line in the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="~/templates/preview.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, Chrome/Safari need some extra time to parse that. I changed it to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.fulldomain.com/templates/preview.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and everything works now. </p>
