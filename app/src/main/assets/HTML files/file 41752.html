<p>I think you are new to OpenXml SDK</p>

<p>First of all you need to use the newest version of Open XMl SDK - Version 2.5  [Download - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425]" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425]</a></p>

<p>Here download BOTH OpenXMLSDKV25.msi , OpenXMLSDKToolV25.msi .. Install BOTH.</p>

<p>Now here is the trick, OpenXML productivity tool is the one you need here. It allows you to brows an existing Excel file and break it down to CODES [watch here - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSMLR19JWA]" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSMLR19JWA]</a></p>

<p>Now what you need to do is create an Excel sheet manually with what you want [In your case add Text Box under the Image] Then open this Excel file with productivity tool and understand the CODE . Note that you will need to understand Spreadsheet file structure to understand this CODE [ Reffer this - <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=open+xml+sdk]" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/#q=open+xml+sdk]</a> .. Now write your codes to meet your requirement using codes of Productivity tool</p>

<p>NOTE - Once you analyse the dummy Spreadsheet with Productivity tool you will understand why giving or guiding with CODE examples as an answer is not practical.<br>
- Happy Coding-</p>
