<p>I've tested the sample code that you've provided and I was able to perform a touch event on the WebView Control without any problems. There are a few ways that I could think of that will make it work for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the touch is at the correct location, note that the touch function uses screen pixels and not dip which will most likely be different when you try to test on multiple devices. You can get the exact location of the button using the "Pointer Location" in the "Dev Tools" app which comes with your emulator.</li>
<li><p>You can use keyboard events instead of touch events to navigate the UI. For example, the sample app that you provided can be done like this:</p>

<pre><code>from com.android.monkeyrunner import MonkeyRunner, MonkeyDevice
device = MonkeyRunner.waitForConnection(10)
device.press('KEYCODE_DPAD_DOWN')
device.press('KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER')
</code></pre>

<p>and will produce the desired effect</p></li>
</ul>
