<p>It will throw an Exception (not sure which), because the object is already attached.</p>

<p>Just try it in code, it's very simple to try. It happened to me.</p>

<p>BTW, you should dispose your contextobject as soon as you end using it. You'll get some weird behavior if don't (objects not updated, cached objects modified directly in db does not reflect changes, etc).</p>
