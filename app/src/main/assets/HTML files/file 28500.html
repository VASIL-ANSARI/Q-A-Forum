<p>You could define new types in the form of (empty) classes:</p>

<pre><code>class Type1 extends List&lt;MyClass4&lt;MyClass5&gt;&gt; { }

class Type2 extends MyClass&lt;MyClass2, MyClass3, Type1&gt; { }

List&lt;Type2&gt; my_list= new List&lt;Type2&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you would loose some of the flexibility of generics but maybe you can do this for some commonly used combinations, possibly even as inner classes.</p>
