<p><code>WebSecurity</code> was introduced in WebMatrix 2 and ASP.NET MVC 4. It relies on the <code>SimpleMembershipProvider</code>. Under the covers it uses <code>FormsAuthentication</code> to manage cookies. So I guess that if you are starting a new project you would opt for the new model if this model fits your needs. Bare in mind that the <code>SimpleMembershipProvider</code> exposes less functionality than the original provider.</p>

<p>The original membership provider uses the SqlMembershipProvider which in turn uses plain ADO.NET to query the database. </p>

<p>The SimpleMembershipProvider uses the new <code>Database</code> class introduced in WebMatrix to query the SQL database.</p>
