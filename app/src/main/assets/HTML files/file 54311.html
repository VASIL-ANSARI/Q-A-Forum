  <li>Is there a better way to finish the activity from another activity?</li>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, What you have done is used <code>static</code> instace on <code>Activity</code> which could easily lead to memory leak issues. <strong>Its always good practice to use  <code>static</code> keyword only if necessary and very carefully as well.</strong> </p>

<p>Better way would use <code>BroadCastreceiver</code> </p>

<p>So, what you need to do is create broadcast receiver in your first and second activity and whenver you wants to finish those activity. use <code>sendBroadCast(..)</code>  method. </p>

<p>you need to search it out how <code>Broadcastreceiver</code> works in android.</p>
