<p>out of my head:</p>

<pre><code>files = ["file_a", "file_b", "file_c"]
sets = []

for f in files:
    f = open("data_a.dat")
    sets.append(set(pickle.load(f)))
    f.close()

intersection = sets[0].intersection(*sets[1:])
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Well I overlooked your mapping to x.GetName()[12:], but you should be able to reduce your problem to set logic.</p>
