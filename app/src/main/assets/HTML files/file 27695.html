<p>To accomplish this, you only need to add <code>banner</code> to both the <code>SELECT</code> list and to the <code>GROUP BY</code>.  However, it must come before the <code>dayofweek</code> expression in the <code>GROUP BY</code>.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  banner,
  (WEEKDAY( date ) +1) dayofweek,
  COUNT(*) count
FROM abanners
WHERE 
  iid = ? 
  AND banner LIKE ?
GROUP BY
  banner,
  dayofweek
ORDER BY count DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I have used the alias <code>dayofweek</code> in the <code>GROUP BY</code> here. MySQL permits aliases in the <code>GROUP BY</code> where some other RDBMS will report an error there.</p>
