<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>-mfloat-abi=name</code>
  Specifies which floating-point ABI to use. Permissible values are: âsoftâ, âsoftfpâ and âhardâ.
  Specifying âsoftâ causes GCC to generate output containing library calls for floating-point operations. âsoftfpâ allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions. âhardâ allows generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The default depends on the specific target configuration. Note that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries. </p>

<p>That means that <code>hard</code> uses hardware specific floating point instructions. <code>soft</code> will <strong>not</strong> use those instructions, but it will implement the FP operations as a software library.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>softfp</code> means that it will use the <code>soft</code> calling conventions (and other ABI), that is it will not use the FP hardware registers to passing or taking parameters, but it will use the hardware FP instructions, if available.</p>

<p>The <code>soft</code> and <code>softfp</code> are link-compatible, that is they use the same ABI, so you can mix them in the same program. But <code>hard</code> will use hardware registers for argument passing, so it cannot be mixed with the other two.</p>

<p>Which one to use? Well, that depends on the system you are using. OS libraries will be compiled for one ABI or the other, and the native compiler will just use that. But if you are using a cross-compiler, then you may need to specify the ABI manually.</p>

<p>The exception is that if you are using a OS with <code>soft</code> ABI, and you are running it in a hardware that you know is capable of hard-FP, then you can compile your programs as <code>softfp</code> and take advantage of that feature without breaking the linking.</p>
