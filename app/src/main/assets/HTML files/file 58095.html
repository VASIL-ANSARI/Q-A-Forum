<p>is the error/warning message you see when the code runs.</p>

<p>In general, no, it's not safe to manipulate a <code>QPixmap</code> on any thread other that that on which the <code>QApplication</code> itself was instantiated.  This is because the <code>QPixmap</code> implementation is (for most Os's) tightly bound to the underlying graphics system.</p>

<p>If you have code on a non-gui thread that wants to change/set an icon then use a queued signal or similar mechanism.</p>
