<p>You can simplify all that code down to just:</p>

<pre><code>class C{

    static class E{
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the question becomes why can a static inner class not be created within a non-static inner class.</p>

<p>This is answered here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire body of a Non-static inner class is Not within a static scope, and therefore you can't have static members in there.</p>
