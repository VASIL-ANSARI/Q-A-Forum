<p>Boolean is not a valid type for the SQL engine.<br>
You would have to use a temporary variable of a supported type for that.</p>

<p>However, if this really is a parameter to your SProc, then it is kinda constant with any given call.</p>

<p>So, why not do it like so:</p>

<pre><code>  someVarForCol2 TABLE_NAME.col2%type;
begin
  SELECT col1, col2
  INTO OUT_COL1, someVarForCol2
  FROM TABLE_NAME;

  OUT_SCORE := CASE WHEN IS_ELIGIBLE THEN someVarForCol2 * 100 ELSE someVarForCol2 * 50 END;
</code></pre>
