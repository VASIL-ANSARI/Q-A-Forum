<p>You can have master on right by passing masterviewcontroller as second parameter to the array assigned to splitViewController.viewcontroller. However, you cannot resize the master and detail views. Hence you will end up having a bigger masterView than the detailview.</p>

<p>Looking at limited functionality of UISplitViewController, it may not be possible to have master on right(properly working as per your requirements). You can have your own controller to get this done or try using opensource options like <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2010/08/03/mgsplitviewcontroller-updated/" rel="nofollow">MGSplitViewController</a>.</p>
