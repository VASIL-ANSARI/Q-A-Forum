<p>If your question is how to make an anonymous class that references objects that you set up in the constructor, you could "inline" an implementation by making an anonymous class and reference <code>final</code> local variables defined in the same method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>private final String someString = ...; // That's the string that you used to init in the constructor; init it here
MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface() { // That's the code that you wanted to have
    public void myFunction()
    {
        System.out.println(someString); // This is allowed, because someString is final
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Behind the scene, Java compiler would generate a class that looks very much like your <code>MyImplementation</code> class, make a constructor that looks like your <code>MyImplementation</code> constructor, and pass <code>someString</code> to it.</p>
