<p>Your question does raise a few more questions. But I make the assumption that it is not to do with its being a console app but may apply to any 'app'. If so ...</p>

<p>I think your problem is in referencing folders at run time. You app may not be running from the folder you think it is.</p>

<p>So two approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to resolve absolute paths at run time (feels bad to me)</li>
<li>Use Windows to use 'standard' areas for files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do a google for 'Environment.SpecialFolder'. In latter version of Windows user editable files should only be in certain folders like 'CommonApplicationData'. This may fit your application or just provide a good common area.</p>

<p>Windows can be 'mean' if you try to put user editable folders in program files areas. Think not of your development environment but of the deployed environment.</p>

<p>Installers generally do support these special folders.</p>
