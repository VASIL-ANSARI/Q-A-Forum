<p>You are close, but you want to move the condition to the <code>having</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT f_id
FROM  table 
GROUP BY f_id
HAVING SUM(sent = 0) = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>having</code> clause counts the number of rows with <code>sent = 0</code>.  The <code>= 0</code> means there are none of them.</p>
