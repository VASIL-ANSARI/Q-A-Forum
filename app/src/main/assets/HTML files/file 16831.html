<p>Your problem is that you're doing the <code>b++</code> AFTER the loop, so it'll only get executed once. Try moving it inside the loop.</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    int i = 1;
    do
    {
        a = i + i;
        label1.Text = i.ToString() + " + " + i.ToString() + "=";
        sagot = Interaction.InputBox("Please type your answer:");
        i++;
        if (a == Convert.ToInt32(sagot))
        {
            b++;
        }

    } while (i &lt;= 10);

    MessageBox.Show("Number of correct answers: " + b.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as a side note, you should work on cleaning up your code a little. Specifically your use of brackets. You don't wanna use brackets unless you're enclosing statements. Typical uses would be method bodies, loops, conditionals, <code>using</code> statements, etc.</p>
