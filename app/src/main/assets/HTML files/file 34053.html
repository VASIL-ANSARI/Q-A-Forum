<p>Given that you know how to resolve a Zip Code to a pair of coordinates (using Google Maps API for example) the problem is to find N teams having at least one user each. and where the distance between any 2 users within the same team is less than or equals 100 miles.</p>

<p>You could use a distance-based clustering algorithm to cluster users into the smallest number of teams (that's what you intuitively thought of as 'regions')</p>

<p>It's like creating one team per user, then iteratively removing a team at a time, reassigning its users to existing teams, until you can't remove a team because you'd break the 100 miles rule (or a more sophisticated rule as your application evolves).</p>

<p>You'll find a PHP implementation here (this one converts miles to pixels, but you can easily modify it)
