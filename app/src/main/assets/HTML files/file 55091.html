  <p>Is there any performance reduction?</p>

<p>I assume you mean, "compared to doing an array lookup".</p>

<p>If so, the answer is (potentially) yes -- any branching operation can potentially cause a pipeline stall (if the CPU mispredicts which branch will be taken), which could make things slower.  CPU branch prediction is pretty good these days, so it might not be an issue in real life--it would depend a lot on the usage patterns of the program that is calling this code.</p>

  <p>If so, how can I remove it. I want to use fields x, y, z other than
  an array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can remove the ifs by using a three-item array instead of three separate items.</p>

<p>If you don't like accessing the items as an array, you can always add accessor methods to make the array look like separate items again:</p>

<pre><code>class Point 
{
public:
   [...]

   float &amp; m_x() {return m_array[0];}
   float &amp; m_y() {return m_array[1];}
   float &amp; m_z() {return m_array[2];}

private:
   float m_array[3];
};

[...]

myPoint.m_x() = 5;
myPoint.m_y() = myPoint.m_x() + myPoint.m_z();
[etc]
</code></pre>
