<p>To be able to solve this we are going to need more of the code that you are using to load the form and possibly the outer portions of the form itself.  The problem likely lies at some point were you load the form.  I am willing to take a guess that you are using a relative url in the form itself and that it is likely the culprit here, but again without more code it is very difficult to tell.  Please expand the question here with more code or use <a href="http://jsfiddle.net" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle.net</a>.  Thank you.</p>
