<p>I'd just like to update that I technically didn't solve this issue, I just worked around it.  My original intention was basically to have a central view controller managing several view controllers, each representing a tab, requiring the use of the Tab Bar Controller.</p>

<p>However, I read somewhere that you don't want to include the Tab Bar Controller element in a regular View Controller XIB file.  I don't know whether this was true or not, but it was reason enough for me to try to work around.  Instead, I settled on one (and only one) view controller to manage everything, and have that view controller be responsible for the views of each tab, rather than a view controller for each tab.</p>

<p>This allowed me to assign the central view controller to implement UITabBarDelegate, and I simply respond to tab changes and swap views.  I had each view sized to fit above the tab bar, and reference its data in the central view controller.</p>
