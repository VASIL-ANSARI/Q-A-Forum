<p>I am pretty sure the text is actually that size (has that extra padding at the top and bottom of the text, double click the text and you will see the actual boundaries).  But to accomplish more of what you want to do, you could add in the following:</p>

<p>line-height:75%;</p>

<p>That should help you achieve what you want.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>noticed you wanted the left too .. use this</p>

<p>text-indent:-14px;</p>
