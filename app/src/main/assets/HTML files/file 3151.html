<p>Each AppDomain has its own probing path for assemblies, configured with the AppDomainSetup class.  The app.config file for the primary AppDomain.  It looks like in your case it is finding an assembly to load but a different one from the one that was used to serialize the data.  The one it found is missing the enum type.  Troubleshoot this with Fuslogvw.exe, it lets you see what assemblies are being resolved.</p>
