<p>i've found the problem.</p>

<p>My input was rendered in a .map() function. Therefore when i wanted to bind with <code>this</code> such as <code>onChange={this.handleDocumentTitleChange.bind(this, index)}</code> it wouldnt work.</p>

<p>So instead i did this <code>var self = this;</code> and binded into <code>self</code> instead.</p>
