<p>This parameter is a timestamp. You can see it's strangely alike what you'd get in the console with</p>

<pre><code>Date.now()
</code></pre>

<p>This is done to ensure the URL changes and avoid receiving a cached version of the page.</p>

<p>It's described in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cache (default: true, false for dataType 'script' and 'jsonp')</p>
  
  <p>Type: Boolean If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be
  cached by the browser. Note: Setting cache to false will only work
  correctly with HEAD and GET requests. It works by appending
  "_={timestamp}" to the GET parameters. The parameter is not needed for
  other types of requests, except in IE8 when a POST is made to a URL
  that has already been requested by a GET.</p>
