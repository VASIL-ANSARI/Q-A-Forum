<p>You didn't mention what the stack trace was - although that might not be relevant.</p>

<p>If it's in the DotNetNuke code, I would load the DotNetNuke source up into your debugger, and recreate the exception.  You might also get away with compiling the (relevant version) DotNetNuke source and just dropping the newly-compiled dll and .pdb files into your \bin directory.</p>

<p>Once you've got that set up, go into Visual Studio -> Debug, Exceptions, and put a checkbox next to 'Common Language Runtime Exceptions' in the 'Thrown' column.  You might also experiment with 'Native Run-Time checks'.</p>

<p>Then recreate your test.  The code should break at the point the exception is thrown.  When this happens you'll be able to inspect not only the stack trace of how you got to that point, you should be able to determine the value that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Note that using this approach you'll come across a lot of other exceptions - there are places where try/catch is used as a way of handling code, and these will all show up.  You'll just have step through these examples until you find the one you need.</p>

<p>If all else fails I would recompile with a 'try/catch' in it and log/break on the offending values, but you shouldn't need to go that far.  Just having Visual Studio break on the thrown error should be enough to isolate the problem.</p>
