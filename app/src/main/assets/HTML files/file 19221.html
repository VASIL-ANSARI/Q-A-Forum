<p>Don't know why this was downvoted, or by whom (probably some troll, as no comment was left), but further research has shown to me that there is no solution.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Take out your sd card and try to take a photo; it says that it needs a card - it wont save to internal; and this is a bundled app.</p>

<p>So I've rolled-back all of my sd checking code:</p>

<p>If there is sd; save</p>

<p>If there is sd, but it is read-only; show error page</p>

<p>If there is no sd; show error page</p>
