<li><p>If you want to add the shadow without having it clickable, you need to add an imageView to as a subview to the button. (make sure clip subviews is disabled).</p></li>
<li><p>If you want the shadow of one button not appearing on top of the other, then you need to have the shadow(s) added separately to the main parent view. The solution in option 1 will not work. Its not neat, but its the only way i can think off.</p></li>
