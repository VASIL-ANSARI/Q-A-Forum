<p>You should add <code>:method =&gt; :delete</code> to trigger delete action. If you have this code in your view and its not working, than my guess is that you either don't have the necessary javascript files in your project (jquery.js and rails.js/jquery_ujs.js) or you are not including them in your layout.
If this is not help you show us your routes and view.</p>
