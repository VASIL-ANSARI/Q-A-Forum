<p>Looks like the output requirement changed a bit! Nevertheless, this should provide enough motivation to smooth out the rough edges.</p>

<pre><code>dataStore = {}

# Method to process an input line
def processLine(dateStr, val):
  if dateStr not in dataStore:
    dataStore[dateStr] = val
  else:
    dataStore[dateStr] += val

# Method to read input file line by line
def doStuff(inFile, outFile):
  with open(inFile, 'r') as fp:
    for line in fp:
      dateStr, val = line.split()

      # cast decimal value to integer
      val = int(val)

      # process the date string to only keep the month and year
      dateStr = dateStr.split('/')
      dateStr = "/".join((dateStr[1], dateStr[2]))

      processLine(dateStr, val)

  # once you are done reading file, generate output
  writeBuf = []
  for key in dataStore:
    writeBuf.append((key, dataStore[key]))
  writeBuf.sort()

  with open(outFile, 'wb') as fp:
    for tup in writeBuf:
      line = '01/'+tup[0]+' - 30/'+tup[0] + '  ' + str(tup[1]) + '\n'
      fp.write(line)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  inFile = 'data.txt'
  outFile = 'result.txt'

  doStuff(inFile, outFile)
</code></pre>

<p>You can easily extend this to include the day as well. Simply modify the part where I process the <code>dateStr</code>. The <code>processLine</code> method would also change.</p>
