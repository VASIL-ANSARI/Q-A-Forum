<p>Your unknown provider name is probably being manipulated/mangled by the minifier, thus you need to use the following syntax to correct it:</p>

<pre><code>myApp.controller('MyCtrl' ['$scope', function ($scope) {
    // do stuff with '$scope'
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the function is wrapped in an Array, this keeps the naming conventions of your dependencies so they can safely be remapped as Strings are not mangled:</p>

<pre><code>myApp.controller('MyCtrl' ['$scope', function (a) {
    // do stuff with 'a'
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>Which you can then add your other dependencies (they need to appear in the order as they're specified):</p>

<pre><code>myApp.controller('MyCtrl' ['$scope', 'MyService', function ($scope, MyService) {
    // do stuff...
}]);
</code></pre>
