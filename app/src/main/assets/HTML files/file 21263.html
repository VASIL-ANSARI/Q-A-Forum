<p>Association with the name: either the executable has a symbol table that gives the dynamic linker information (essentially a map) about names and the corresponding addresses, or if the executable is stripped, there's no name at all and only the raw address is referred to.</p>

<p>Association with the type: simply the compiler generates code that treats that address as the beginning of a 4-byte unsigned integer (e. g. instructions operating on <code>DWORD</code>s, etc.)</p>
