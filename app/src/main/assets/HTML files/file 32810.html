<p>No, it's not possible with CSS.</p>

<p>For that you will have to use JavaScript (<code>document.getElementById(elementOne).offsetWidth</code> or similar, depending on exactly what width you are looking for). Calc is <a href="http://css-tricks.com/a-couple-of-use-cases-for-calc/" rel="nofollow">used</a> to do math, not execute scripts. There is no way of putting JS in a CSS statement, like you are trying to do.</p>
