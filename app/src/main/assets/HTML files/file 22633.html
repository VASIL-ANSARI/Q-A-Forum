<p>you cannot access a non-static instance method/variable from static context directly. you will need an instance of your class to access them . </p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){
    HighLowGame  ref = new HighLowGame ();
   ref. generateRandomNumber();
    ref.getUserInput();
    ref.getResult();
}
</code></pre>

<p>or you can make all these methods <strong>static</strong> and access them directly. make methods static when you think all the instances of that class should share the date/methods.</p>
