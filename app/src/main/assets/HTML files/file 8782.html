<p>Yes, for small allocations (&lt; 128k, as I recall) glibc will generally use <code>sbrk</code> and maintain its own free list.  For larger allocations, it will use <code>mmap()</code> and <code>munmap()</code>.</p>

<p><code>munmap</code> will definitely return the memory to the system.  It is a system call; glibc just passes it through to the kernel.</p>

<p>Assuming this is Linux, you can verify mmap's behavior for yourself by writing some test code and doing <code>cat /proc/PID/maps</code> where <code>PID</code> is the process ID of your process.  It will print for line for each virtual memory area (VMA) that the kernel is maintaining for your process; essentially, one for each mmap().</p>

<p>However, even if glibc does not return the memory to the system, it will recycle it via its own internal free list.  Given that, plus the fact that using mmap()/munmap() did not change anything, has it occurred to you that perhaps your program has a memory leak?</p>
