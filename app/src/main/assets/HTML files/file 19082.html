<p>Well, the <code>minRequiredPasswordLength</code> is configured in your Membership provider section. Take a look at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/12702649/114029">question</a> to see an example where it's set to 6.</p>

<p>Given that, you should access this value using the following property on the <code>Membership</code> type:</p>

<pre><code>var minPassLength = System.Web.Security.Membership.MinRequiredPasswordLength;
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't work maybe you have a custom provider implementation that overrides the property value set in <code>Web.config</code> - see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9990435/114029">here</a> for an example. In this case I'd suggest you do a search in your entire solution to find the string <code>minRequiredPasswordLength</code> and see from where this value is coming. If the custom provider comes from a third party DLL, you must have access to the library code to change that value.</p>
