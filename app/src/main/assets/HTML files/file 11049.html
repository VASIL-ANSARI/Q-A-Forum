<p>Well the answer that is about to come is probably one you won't like, but I'll give it anyways :)</p>

<p>C++ has no notion of graphics output at all. Luckily, we have gotten a standardized way of printing text to the screen - but thats it. Really. No joking here.</p>

<p>However, most operating systems provide a means of graphics output (mostly via a C interface, as C is binary compatible to almost everything), and there are also C++ wrapper libraries that incorporate access to those. Dealing with OS issues is, however, a very different beast than C++ is (and thats kinda beast, I can tell ;).</p>

<p>Luckily, if you don't want to/have to understand the full story, I can recommend Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/products/) as a very decent library for GUI programming. And once you have a GUI window, you will also have the possibility to draw a bitmap into that GUI (I believe Qt has direct bitmap support and also the possibility to load images).
However, I will have to refer you to the tutorial docs of Qt, as even a simple introduction would go way over what would be a still understandable forum answer.</p>

<p>And this, I'm afraid, will be as easy as it can get drawing something onto the screen using C++. Nowhere near the simplicity of Flash for that purpose but in the end way more powerful.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
