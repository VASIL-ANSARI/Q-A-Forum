<p>You're not storing your result from the function <em>handler</em>. Or calling the function <em>band</em>. Need something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>$result = handler($weekly);
$totalBand = band(result);
echo '&lt;p&gt;Total band = ' . $totalBand . 'bytes&lt;/p&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>Could chain or do this as a one liner if wanted, but it'd look pretty ugly.</p>

<p>Might want to readup on <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php" rel="nofollow">Scope</a>, as it looks like you're trying to access local function variables from the global scope. After the function has completed, you can't access the variables inside of the function anymore, unless they're declared globally.</p>
