<p>The only thing that stands out to me right off the bat, is the following line</p>

<pre><code>                 if ($accounts[password] == password($password)){
</code></pre>

<p>The key will be translated into a PHP constant, which to my best guess looking at your code, has not been defined. Wrap the key in quotations, like the following.</p>

<pre><code>                 if ($accounts["password"] == password($password)){
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that helps solve your issue :)</p>
