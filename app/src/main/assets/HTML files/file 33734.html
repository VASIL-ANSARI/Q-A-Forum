<p>This will generally happen with all odd widths, but it will be less noticeable than with a width of 1.</p>

<p>The reason is because you are drawing your 1 pixel line exactly on a pixel boundary.  This means that because of antialiasing, the renderer is drawing 50% of the line on one row of pixels, and 50% on the row of pixels below.</p>

<p>You can't actually draw half a pixel, so what it is doing is draw the pixel at 50% opacity on each line.</p>

<pre><code>+---+---+---+
|50%|50%|50%|
+---+---+---+  ...etc...
|50%|50%|50%|
+---+---+---+
</code></pre>

<p>For the first line it is drawing a mix of 50% white (the background) and 50% blue.</p>

<p>For the overdrawn line, it is drawing a mix of 50% blue-white mix and 50% blue.  Resulting in a darker blue.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>

<p>Make sure your one pixel lines are drawn at the half pixel point so that the line is not split over two rows of pixels. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var myLine = lineGraph.append("svg:line")
    .attr("x1", 40)
    .attr("y1", 100.5)
    .attr("x2", 450)
    .attr("y2", 100.5)
    .style("stroke", "rgb(6,120,155)")
    .style("stroke-width", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, for vertical lines, you would need to add 0.5 to the X coordinate instead.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you can't do that, then an alternative solution is to set the <code>shape-rendering</code> attribute to <code>crispEdges</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var myLine = lineGraph.append("svg:line")
    .attr("x1", 40)
    .attr("y1", 100)
    .attr("x2", 450)
    .attr("y2", 100)
    .attr('shape-rendering', 'crispEdges')
    .style("stroke", "rgb(6,120,155)")
    .style("stroke-width", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>But beware, this turns off anti-aliasing for the line, so if it isn't perfectly horizontal or vertical, it will look bad.</p>
