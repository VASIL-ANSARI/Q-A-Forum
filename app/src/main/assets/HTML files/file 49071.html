<p>The problem is here:</p>

<pre><code>for x in self.entry_list:
   entry = x.get()
   if entry:
        self.checktext.delete(0.0, END)
        self.checktext.insert(END, entry + "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>You're deleting everything in the widget before putting the next string into it, every time. To fix the issue, simply don't delete everything every time. If you want to clear the widget before repopulating it, move the deletion out of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>self.checktext.delete(0.0, END)
for x in self.entry_list:
   entry = x.get()
   if entry:
        self.checktext.insert(END, entry + "\n")
</code></pre>
