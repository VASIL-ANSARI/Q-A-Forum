  <p>So how this should be done? Loop through the double array and convert each double and somehow concatenating them to one bytearray?</p>

<p>Exactly. You can make use of DoubleBuffer, perhaps. (Marko linked it in his comment)</p>

<p>What Marko referred to was having actually a ByteBuffer and fetching a "DoubleBuffer"-View to it. So you can <code>put</code> the Doubles into the DoubleBuffer View and fetch the byte[] from the original ByteBuffer.</p>
