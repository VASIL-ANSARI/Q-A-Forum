<p>What you can do is , since for each account there is an address, invoice# and  invoice details or <strong>orders</strong> in your case,<br />
 <br />
So what you can do is :</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong>  Let me go in some detailed fashion !</p>

<p>1.Create a new report and add a Tablix to it 
<br /><code>--Tablix has the property , it can iterate through your data</code><br />
and create dataset which will get data for Account address, invoice, and Terms. Then :<br />

<p><br /><br />if you are not able to view the image properly ..<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bzg8dbh1CrN9bXRkVnB1NDRtSGM/edit">here</a> is the same presented for you <br />
<br /> This is the way I did my reports with similar requirements...<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd220581%28v=sql.105%29.aspx">sub-reports</a> would ease the tasks to a much extent .. 
 <br /><br /><br />
 p.s:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit:</strong> No need to go for a Header.. as you say in your subject of question.
jus the main report and a sub-report should do what you need !</li>
<li>I jus saw yours is <code>crystal report</code>.. but the concept is over all the same</li>
</ul>
