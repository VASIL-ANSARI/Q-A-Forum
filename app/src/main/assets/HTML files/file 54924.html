<p>I post a solution to my problem, In order to get the <strong>exact</strong> frame time I simply extended MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.java class  from ExoPlayer library and used the value of lastOutputBufferTimestamp which is in function:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected boolean processOutputBuffer(long positionUs, long elapsedRealtimeUs,
                                      MediaCodec codec, ByteBuffer buffer, MediaCodec.BufferInfo bufferInfo, int bufferIndex,
                                      boolean shouldSkip) {
    boolean processed = super.processOutputBuffer(positionUs, elapsedRealtimeUs, codec, buffer,
            bufferInfo, bufferIndex, shouldSkip);
    if (!shouldSkip &amp;&amp; processed) {
        lastOutputBufferTimestamp = bufferInfo.presentationTimeUs;
    }
    return processed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It does give me the exact time and not a rounded time from, last say, mPlayer.getDuration() or something like that.
If you have a constant FPS in your video you can calculate that by division and get the number of the frame.
It was simply enough for me to know the exact frame time.</p>

<p>I'm using ExoPlayer version r1.5.3 so I don't know if this solution will work for newer version since code has probably changed.</p>
