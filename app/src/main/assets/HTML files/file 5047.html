<p>There's no reason why it should take 3 minutes to start debugging something unless you've got something really strange going on.</p>

<p>I suggest you launch the debugger, try to navigate to a page and then just break into the debugger while it's loading. See where you're losing time. Maybe you're making some call on startup which is failing, but taking minutes to do so.</p>

<p>I've never experienced anything like what you're describing, which suggests it's either in your environment <em>or</em> in your code - and if it's a generally fast computer, that suggests it's somewhere in the code.</p>

<p>If you create a brand new MVC project and debug into that, does <em>that</em> take a long time?</p>

<p>You might also want to run <a href="http://wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> when you start debugging - see whether something in your app is trying to fetch a network resource of some description without you realising it.</p>
