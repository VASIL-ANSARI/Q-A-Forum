<p>Nopeâthatâs what âantialiasingâ looks like on a shape node. You might be expecting to see something more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisampling">multisampling</a>, but thatâs not what SpriteKit is doing here. To get the smooth non-blurry lines youâre looking for youâll have to draw your shapes into an image and then display that in an SKNode. You might also consider <a href="http://bugreport.apple.com">filing an enhancement request</a> on the API.</p>
