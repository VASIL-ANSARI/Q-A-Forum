<p>As far as i know break points are not changing the compiled code, neither normal ones or data breakpoints.</p>

<p>The program is being compiled using a compiler then the debugger runs using the compiled executable.</p>

<p>The code being changed is the in-memory code. The debugger loads the executable to the memory and change the code there.</p>
