<p>Percussion sounds have different characteristics. Kick drum has most energy in the lower part of the frequency spectrum and cymbals/hats have most energy in the high end of the frequency spectrum. Snare drum distribution is generally fairly wide and similar in timbre to wideband noise. So to detect this, you'd have to perform a fourier transform over the signal to perform analysis in the frequency domain rather than the time domain, and detect percussive wideband noise. You'd definitely be better off asking this on a DSP forum rather than a programmer's forum.</p>
