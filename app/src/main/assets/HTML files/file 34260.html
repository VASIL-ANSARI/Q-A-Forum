<p>The thing that is missing is a controller that displays while <code>Color.fetch</code> is running.  So the method returns and <code>@window.rootViewController</code> hasn't been set to anything, until the block inside Color.fetch is called.  That's also why <code>presentViewController(..)</code> is having trouble - there's no controller to do the presenting!</p>

<p>So the first iteration would be to have a "loading" view controller.  That's not a <em>great</em> user experience, though... next I would modify the ColorController to store the last result of <code>Color.fetch</code> and display that, then when new data comes in update the UI.  A bit more work, but a better UX, I think.  And when there is no cached data it can have its own 'loading' screen, or it can present the LoadingViewController as a modal, something like that.</p>

<p>This would also involve moving the <code>Color.fetch</code> code OUT of the <code>AppDelegate</code>, which I strongly urge anyway (separation of concerns).  I think controllers should be responsible for loading their own data.</p>
