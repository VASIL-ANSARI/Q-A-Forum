<li>Add an <code>IBOutlet</code> propertyfor your custom UIView to the UIViewController, and additional outlets for any subviews you wish to access.</li>
<li>Go to Interface Builder, select the "File's Owner" object in your NIB and in the Inspector go the rightmost tab set its class to match your UIViewController's class.</li>
<li>Connect the IBOutlet from step one on the  "File's Owner" to your custom UIView.</li>
<li>In XCode, when you need to load your view, do something like this:</li>
</ol>

<p>--</p>

<pre><code>   [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"MyNib" owner:self options:0];
   self.myCustomView.frame=self.view.bounds; // make view fill screen - customize as necessary
   [self.view addSubview:self.myCustomView];
