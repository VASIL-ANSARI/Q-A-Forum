<p>I would rearrange to the code to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>boolean airborne = false;

while (true) // the main game loop
{
    if (y &lt;= 48 &amp;&amp; airborne) // if player just hit the ground
    {
        //  Perform the "bounce" by changing their vertical direction and decreasing its magnitude
        ySpeed = -ySpeed/2.0;

        //  This will stop them from bouncing infinitely.  After the bounce gets too small,
        //  they will finally land on the ground.  I suggest you play around with this number to find one that works well
        if (Math.abs(ySpeed) &lt;= 0.5)
        {
            //  Stop the bouncing
            ySpeed = 0;

            //  Place them on the ground
            airborne = false;
            y = 48;
        }
    }
    //  Apply friction if they are on the ground
    if (!airborne)
    {
        // Friction on ground
        if ((!Keyboard.isKeyDown(Keyboard.KEY_LEFT)) &amp;&amp; xspeed &lt; 0) xspeed = xspeed * 0.925;
        if ((!Keyboard.isKeyDown(Keyboard.KEY_RIGHT)) &amp;&amp; xspeed &gt; 0) xspeed = xspeed * 0.925;
    }
    //  Apply a jump action if they're pressing the jump button while on the ground
    if (Keyboard.isKeyDown(Keyboard.KEY_UP) &amp;&amp; !airborne) 
    {
        airborne = true;
        yspeed = 10;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So in this case instead of keeping track of whether or not they just executed a jump, you keep track of whether or not they are in the air.</p>

<p>I assume you have some kind of gravity constant that you're subtracting from the ySpeed variable each frame.  Each frame, you'll want to reset their ySpeed back to zero if they are on the ground, or just not apply gravity while they're on the ground</p>
