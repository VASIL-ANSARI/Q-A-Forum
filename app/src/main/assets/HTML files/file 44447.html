<p>The 2nd version can result in a very risky and poor animation since it can result in repaints being called repeatedly, and is something that should never be done. If you need simple animation in a Swing GUI, use a Swing Timer to drive the animation.</p>

<p>i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent extends JComponent {
    private Rectangle r = new Rectangle(0,0,20,10);

    public MyComponent() {
        int timerDelay = 100;
        new Timer(timerDelay, new ActionListener(){
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                r.translate(5, 5);
                repaint();
            }
        }).start();
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
        g2.draw(r);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The use of <code>repaint()</code> is to <em>suggest</em> to the JVM that the component needs to be painted, but it should never be called in a semi-recursive fashion within the paint or paintComponent method. An example of its use can be seen above. Note that you don't want to call the painting methods -- paint or paintComponent directly yourselves except under very unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>Also avoid calling a class <code>Componenet</code> since that name clashes with a key core Java class.</p>
