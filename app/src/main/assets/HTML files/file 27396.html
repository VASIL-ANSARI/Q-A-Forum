<p>How you load imagines doesn't have anything to do with packages.  </p>

<p>Normally you find an image as a resource via class path.  This can be arranged any way you wish.</p>

  <p>I tried some methods, but I just can't understand how can I make the src connected to the folder.</p>

<p>Usually you build an application.  When you run it, you use the build, not the src. i.e. you don't use the source when you run the program.  Usually the images are copied with the same relative path you used in your source and this relative path is what you use to find and load your images.</p>

<p>I can't be more specific, as there is not enough detail in the questions such as what you directory structure is and which IDE or build system you are using.</p>
