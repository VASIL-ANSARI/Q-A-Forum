<p>well you can use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree" rel="nofollow">binary search tree</a> and to write them back to the output file you can use this algorithm :</p>

<pre><code>void output_to_file(FILE* file , struct* binTree)
{
     if(binTree != NULL)
     {
         output_to_file(binTree-&gt;left);
         fprintf(file , "%d/n" , binTree-&gt;num); //num is the member of the structure that carrys the number
     output_to_file(binTree-&gt;right);
     }
}
</code></pre>
