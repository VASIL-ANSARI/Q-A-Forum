<p>Wooahh you've added position fixed onto every single element of the page with this line:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    position: fixed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should only add position fixed to the element you want to be fixed. If its the top nav then something like this.</p>

<pre><code>nav#top {
  position: fixed;
}
</code></pre>
