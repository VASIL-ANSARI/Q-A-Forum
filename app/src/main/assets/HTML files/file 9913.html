<p>Check <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.endofstream.aspx" rel="nofollow">StreamReader.EndOfStream</a>.  Stop your read loop when this is <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure your code correctly handles the returned value for "byte count just read" on <code>ReadBlock</code> calls as well.  Sounds like you are seeing zero bytes read, and just assuming the unchanged buffer contents you see is another read of the same data.</p>
