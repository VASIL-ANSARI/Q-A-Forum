<p>You can't do it with a model-level <code>to_json</code> call, you'll need to build an intermediary data representation as @Paul said.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyObj
  def to_json
    [id, uuid, name]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>class MyController &lt; ApplicationController
  def grid_data
    objs = MyObj.all
    json_data = {
      :total =&gt; objs.count,
      :page =&gt; 1,
      :records =&gt; 1500,
      :rows =&gt; objs.collect {|o| o.to_json}
    }
    ... send json as usual ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I set your model up to generate an array, not a hash as you specified, as I think you copied that wrong - your JSON example above is not valid.  { 20, 'foo', 'bar' } is not valid JSON as "{...}" represents a hash, which must be keyed, and is not ordered. </p>
