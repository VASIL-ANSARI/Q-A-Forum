<p>You don't have to use the page url when using the page object gem.  It is only relevant if you have to navigate directly to that page.  If you are already on the page then you can just execute your method.</p>

<p>If you do need to navigate to that page, and don't know the url until runtime you can define a method that takes the part of the url that you don't know until runtime and navigates to the page.</p>

<pre><code>def navigate_to_order_page(order_number)
  @browser.goto("https://www.test-xyz.com/order/#{order_number}")
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then just call  that method when you want to go to the page.</p>
