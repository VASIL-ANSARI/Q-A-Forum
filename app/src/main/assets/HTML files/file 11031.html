<p>The animation itself shouldn't be slow. All you really need to be doing is changing the Y position of the two views for the animation.</p>

<p>Why don't you try putting static images into the UIImageViews and seeing how the animation performs then?</p>

<p>If the lag is happening when you are creating the images, maybe you should consider moving that code to a separate thread so that the main thread doesn't freeze up. When the images are done being created, notify the main thread, put them in the UIImageViews, and perform the animation.</p>
