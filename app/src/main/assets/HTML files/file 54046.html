<p>1) You're using the key argument of sort wrong. Key specifies what part of each item in your list is being used to sort. In my example, I'm supplying an anonymous function which is saying that for each item in <code>l</code>, use the value at index 0 for determining sort order </p>

<pre><code>l = [
    [3,1,2],
    [1,5,2],
    [0,9,3],
    [2,5,2]
]
l.sort(key=lambda x : x[0])
print l # prints [[0, 9, 3], [1, 5, 2], [2, 5, 2], [3,1,2]]
</code></pre>

<p>2) In order to do your sort, you'll likely need to perform a split on each line, identify which index the score is sitting in, and cast it to an int. This should do the sort:</p>

<p><code>lines.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x : int(x.strip().split('Score: ')[1].replace(']', '').replace('"', "").replace("'", "")))</code></p>

<p>Here's what's happening:</p>

<ol>
<li>Split the string on score so we get back <code>["[Name: Blah Blah", "10]"]</code></li>
<li>We grab the item from the new list where the score is sitting (index 1)</li>
<li>Replace the ], ', and " characters so we don't fail our int cast</li>
<li>Cast the score to an int for numeric sorting</li>
</ol>

<p>3) Probably not the best idea to write from the same file you were just reading from. It would be better to put it somewhere like <code>"database_results\Class_{0}_sorted.txt".format(option)"</code></p>
