<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I did the following test and it worked fine:</p>

<pre><code>private class MyLabel extends JLabel {
    public MyLabel(String text) {
        super(text);
    }
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return true;
    }
};


public MyPanel() {
    getContentPane().setLayout(new GridLayout());
    getContentPane().add(new MyLabel("Label 1"));
    getContentPane().add(new MyLabel("Label 2"));
    getContentPane().add(new MyLabel("Label 3"));
}
</code></pre>

<p>What problems are you facing?</p>

<p>BTW: This will not solve your problem, but JavaDoc for <code>equals</code> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that it is generally necessary to override the <code>hashCode</code> method whenever this method is overridden</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>If a card extends a <code>JLabel</code>, and you create an instance for every card you have, you should not have to override <code>equals</code> at all. Make sure not to add the same card to two containers (or to one container twice). This would not work for real cards either.</p>

<p>It might be a better approach to split the card class from their visualization. Have you considered not extending your card from a swing class?</p>

<p>You could just override <code>toString</code> and display them in a <code>JList</code>.</p>
