<p>Well, I don't think we should talk about 'bindings' here. The link @Incognito gave in comments to the question describes binding of variables and functions - but not their <em>values</em>.</p>

<p>As 'x' in your example has a primitive value assigned, I don't think there's a way to alter it - if not in an assignment (direct or syntax-sugar one).</p>

<p>For example, this...</p>

<pre><code>var x = 42;
x.y   = 24;
</code></pre>

<p>... won't actually result in changing <code>x</code> (it gets converted into an object, assigned a new property, but then this object will be just thrown away).</p>

<p>And this... </p>

<pre><code>function x() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>... will also fail to assign a new value to <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: My point is that <code>'var x = 42'</code> statement in JS (but not in Erlang) won't result in binding of <code>42</code> (number literal) to variable <code>x</code>.</p>
