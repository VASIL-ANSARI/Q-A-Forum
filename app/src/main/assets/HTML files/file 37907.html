<p>Why remove them? That makes no sense, there isn't really a reason I can see that being a requirement. Just double them in-place.</p>

<pre><code>num.each_index { |i| nums[i] *= 2 if i.even? }
</code></pre>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to remove/replace/re-insert, use <code>zip</code>/<code>flatten</code> to interweave the two arrays back together:</p>

<pre><code>['a','b','c'].zip([1, 2, 3]).flatten
=&gt; ["a", 1, "b", 2, "c", 3]
</code></pre>
