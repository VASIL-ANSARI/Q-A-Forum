<p>The following code doesn't read a remote file system, it's used for reading files on your local hard drive.</p>

<pre><code>import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'

fs.readdir(path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'public'), 'utf8', (err, files) =&gt; {
    files.forEach((file) =&gt; console.info(file))
})
</code></pre>

<p>Will print out all the file names from one directory up and in a 'public' directory from the script location.  You can use <code>fs.readFile</code> to read the contents of each file. If they are JSON, you may read them as utf8 strings and parse them with <code>JSON.parse</code>.</p>

<p>To read files from a remote server, they must be served via express or some other static file server:</p>

<pre><code>import express from 'express'
const app = express()
app.use(express.static('public'))
app.listen(8000)
</code></pre>

<p>Then on the client end you could use fetch or request http library to call the express endpoint hosted at port 8000 (in this simple example.</p>
