<p>Just requiring the file should work. Perhaps its not finding the file in question, you should use require <code>require Rails.root.join('spec/support/shared_context.rb')</code> to be sure.</p>

<p>I normally require the entire spec/support directory in my spec_helper.rb</p>

<pre><code>Dir[Rails.root.join('spec/support/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }
</code></pre>
