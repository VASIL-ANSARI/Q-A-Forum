<p>Yes -- you can <strong>use the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Plugin" rel="nofollow">JUnit plugin</a></strong> to do that. Despite its name, it's not tied to unit testing alone.</p>

<p>The plugin can</p>

<ul>
<li>display the success status of individual sub-tests</li>
<li>give a "failed since" indication for failed sub-tests</li>
<li>provide summary statistics on total passed/failed count over builds</li>
</ul>

<p>Only caveat: you must <strong>convert your result list to JUnit XML format</strong>, so the plugin can process this as input data. The format is rather straightforward, though, and conversion should not be much effort.</p>
