<p>Well, any self-respecting web server, when seeing this:</p>

<p>dir("http://daveywhitney.com/randomizer/clips/");</p>

<p>will get very angry. It looks like your server is self respecting! Yay! But what does that mean for you and <strong>how do you fix it?</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that <code>"http://daveywhitney.com/randomizer/clips/"</code> is actually an HTTP request String. This means that only things which can go to HTTP requests can try to read from it -- unfortunately, <code>dir</code> is not that type of function.</p>

<p><strong>So, that's the problem, how do you fix it?</strong></p>

<p>You actually have a couple of options. </p>

<p>First, if the directory exists on your server, you could simply look up the directory manually yourself. Simply replace <code>"http://daveywhitney.com/</code> with something on your local path (maybe <code>/var/www/htdocs/randomizer</code>?)</p>

<p>If it isn't a local directory, that does not mean you are SOL. Apache, for one, will output the contents of a directory in valid HTML, which means it can be parsed with <code>DOMDocument</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$str = file_get_contents('http://daveywhitney.com/randomizer/clips/');
$doc = new DomDocument();
$doc-&gt;loadHTML($str);
$doc-&gt;getElementsByTagName('a'); //?? Not sure if that is right fn name.
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
