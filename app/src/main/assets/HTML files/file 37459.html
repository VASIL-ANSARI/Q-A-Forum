<p>I have also had an app rejected for allowing manual input of ProximityUUIDs.  My understanding of Apple's position is that this applies only to <strong>transmitting</strong> as a beacon, and that it is allowed to have manual user input of ProximityUUIDs for detection purposes.  The reason they don't want you to transmit with a manually entered ProximityUUIDs is because it allows creation of an easy hacker tool for "spoofing" other folks' beacons.</p>

<p>That said, your use case is different still, because you are getting the ProximityUUIDs from a server, not directly from user input.  I have several apps in the AppStore that do exactly this, and it is a common practice, so I don't anticipate it will be a problem for you.</p>
