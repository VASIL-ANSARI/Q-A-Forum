<p><strong>I think that putting the builder inside the <code>Item</code> class itself is a bad design decision regardless of the possible complicated logic.</strong></p>

<p>It is definitely violating the SRP (Single Responsible Principle). If we would follow such approach, then we will put everything even indirectly related to the Item class to the class itself strongly restricting any further extensibility.</p>
