<p>I would get the repair and fueling ids using correlated subqueries:</p>

<pre><code>select v.*,
       (select r.repairId
        from repairs r
        where r.vehicleID = v.vehicleID
        order by r.datefinished desc
        limit 1
       ) as repairid,
       (select vh.vehiclefuelingId
        from vehiclefueling vh
        where vh.vehicleID = v.vehicleID
        order by vh.date desc
        limit 1
       ) as vehiclefuelingId
from vehicle v;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can join back to the two tables to get additional fields.</p>

<p>This should give you some idea on how to approach the problem.  Your sample query has additional tables and logic that don't fit directly into your question.</p>
