<p>If your XML generator doesn't generate an <code>Extended-Attribute</code> tag for attributes that has no value, so there is no way to reference them in your XSLT.</p>

<p>There should be a way to tell XSLT processor about what properties (how many <code>Extended-Attribute</code> tag) should exists in <code>Extended-Attributes</code> collections. This way maybe you can have a XSLT code which looks for those attribute names in the collection and if it couldn't find them, use the default empty apostrophes value. Of course it should be complicated. I suggest to change your XML generator part if you can</p>
