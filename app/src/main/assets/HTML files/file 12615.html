<p>It might be possible to save it, but I think the ticket will be short lived. Unfortunately, you'll definitely run in to the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2008/06/13/understanding-kerberos-double-hop.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Understanding Kerberos Double Hop">Kerberos double-hop issue</a> where authentication fails from service to service unless you have delegation properly set up on your network. This will require you to set up some SPN's (service principal names) on your active directory to tell the servers to trust each other.</p>

<p>I've never tried to save Kerberos tickets for any length of time so even after fighting with delegation and SPNs it may not work.</p>

<p>Here's a quick post on setting up <a href="http://forums.iis.net/p/1179968/1989185.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Double Hop: How to change TokenImpersonationLevel to Delegation?">IIS7 to handle double hop Kerberos tickets</a> and another article on <a href="http://mkdot.net/blogs/dejan/archive/2008/03/07/kerberos-solution-for-double-hop-authentication.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Kerberos - solution for double hop authentication">handling it from the networks point of view</a>.</p>

<p>I wish I could be of more help, and posting code and not articles - but as you investigate you'll see this is the bane of Kerberos authentication. Good luck!</p>
