<p>Based on this being form submit, that it looks like you are trying to automate, my guess is that the remote server is looking for that token value in session to compare to to prevent against session hi-jacking attacks.  If this is the case, you will likely need to save the session cookie that is sent, and send the session cookie back with each request (along with the regenerated token of course).</p>
