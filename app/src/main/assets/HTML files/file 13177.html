<p>This is because your CSS styles refer to <code>.pika-image</code>, which is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> dynamically created by your plugin. When the page loads, the images are contained within a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> of <code>id="pikame"</code>, which is not affected by your CSS.</p>

<p>To get this "Flash of Unstyled Content" to go away, you'll need to add in CSS to target these images before the slideshow loads. I suggest turning off Javascript and then writing CSS to make them look the way you want.</p>

<pre><code>#pikame {
    list-style: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>is a good start.</p>
