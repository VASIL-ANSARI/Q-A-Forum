<p>You can use tools like <a href="http://structure101.com/" rel="nofollow">Structure 101</a> or <a href="http://schauder.github.io/degraph/" rel="nofollow">Degraph</a> to get an overall overview of the structure and important classes (the ones lot of stuff depends on).</p>

<p>If it is well coded the package structure and names will give you some hint.</p>

<p>If you want to get more detailed insight, I recommend identifying something that gets triggered by the ui, like a button listener, maybe a worker, or something that extends JPanel/JForm or the like. But a break point there and let the debugger give you a tour through the application from the UI through the business logic to the database and back. </p>

<p>Also running some analysis on the version control system to find the stuff that is very stable vs the stuff that got changed a lot lately might be useful.</p>
