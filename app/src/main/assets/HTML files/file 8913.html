<p><code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code> is convenience method declared in <code>UIViewController</code> and is available to its subclasses. This will initialize the view controller by loading the nib, probably by using <code>loadNibName:owner:options:</code> method internally.</p>

<p><code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code> is unavailable to <code>UIView</code> and its subclasses. So we have to make use of <code>loadNibName:owner:options:</code> to load views.</p>

<ol>
<li>Custom cells are <code>UIView</code> subclasses and hence make use of <code>loadNibName:owner:options:</code>.</li>
<li>Not much difference. <code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code> is a convenience method for <code>UIViewController</code> initialization.</li>
<li>You are getting errors because of the reasons mentioned above.</li>
</ol>
