  <p>Can the values of 'str' and 'int1' be changed once they have been assigned a value?</p>

<p>Yes, <code>struct</code>'s properties can be changed. <code>struct</code>s are not immutable per se.</p>

<p>But it is considered a good design to make them unchangeable.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229031.aspx" rel="nofollow">Struct Design</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>X DO NOT</strong> define mutable value types.</p>
  
  <p>Mutable value types have several problems. For example, when a property getter returns a value type, the caller receives a copy. Because the copy is created implicitly, developers might not be aware that they are mutating the copy, and not the original value. Also, some languages (dynamic languages, in particular) have problems using mutable value types because even local variables, when dereferenced, cause a copy to be made.</p>
