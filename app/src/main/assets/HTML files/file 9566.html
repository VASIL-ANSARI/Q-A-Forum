<p>As the count will return a null value you will have to wrap it in an NZ function like this</p>

<pre><code>NZ(Count([Issue Mgt].ID),0)
</code></pre>

<p>Its like a mini "If, Then" statement, the first part is what you are checking and the second part is what to return if the first part is null</p>
