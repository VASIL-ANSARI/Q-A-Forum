  <p>Is there a way to use c++ opengl in UWP and still use C# as a main language?</p>

<p>ANGLE is currently the only way to get the OpenGL API to run in UWP. More details please reference <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ae97534f-8f48-4bf9-ae7e-2c7a12e75190/uwp-opengl-in-c?forum=wpdevelop" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>You can write your own via interop if you want to use ANGLE from c#.  You can just write your low level OpenGL stuff in C++ and wrapper it, and invoke it by c# in your logic level. </p>

<p>Fortunately, people who has same requirements with you created an issue on the GitHub few days ago, and got samples from @mattleibow. @mattleibow shared his code in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39432377/marshalling-eglrenderresolutionscaleproperty-to-angle-from-c-sharp-using-p-inv">this thread</a>. More details please reference <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/angle/issues/89" rel="nofollow">OpenGL surface from SwapChainPanel declared in XAML in C#</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/angle" rel="nofollow">ANGLE</a> is actually for translating OpenGL ES to DirectX. So I recommend you to use <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D" rel="nofollow">Win2D</a> instead. Win2D is a new, immediate mode 2D drawing framework for XAML applications on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. It is built on the high performance foundation of DirectX, but is designed to provide the convenience and ease of use expected by C# and .NET developers.
