  <p>I want to customize the app for different customers without recompiling it.</p>

<p>Not possible. The app is signed before you distribute it. Any change will invalidate the signature and the device will refuse to run it. You'll need to recompile if you want to change things like the app icon.</p>

<p>The splash screen is somewhat different. You can't change the default image, but you can omit the default image and display your own splash screen as soon as the app is loaded. That screen can contain an image that you download from a server, for example.</p>

<p>Give that you're talking about enterprise distribution, I think the best plan is to simply create separate targets in your project, one for each customized version. Each target would reference different icon and default image files. You can even create an aggregate target, so that all the customized versions are built at the same time.</p>

<p>Instructions for adding a customized target, assuming Xcode 4:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Select the project in the project navigator. </p></li>
<li><p>Click the Add Target button at the bottom of the detail area, or just select the target and use the Edit->Duplicate command.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a copy of the Info.plist file from your first target and add it to the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the new target and change it's "Info.plist" setting in the Packaging section of Build Settings. (You may also want to adjust the product name.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To add an aggregate target that builds all the others, add a target using the Aggregate target template (under Other in the template picker). Then select the new aggregate target, click Build Phases, and add all your other targets as target dependencies.</p>
