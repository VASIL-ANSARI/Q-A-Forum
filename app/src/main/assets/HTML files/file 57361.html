<p>You show no code of your tries...<br>
This is kind of difficult to answer precisely.</p>

<p>But I think I can show you the track to begin.</p>

<p>You need to Â«fixÂ» the position of a <code>div</code> on top of the page.<br>
So if you have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="navBar"&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can fix it on top of the page with this CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#navBar{
    Position:fixed;
    z-index:1;
    top:0;
    width:100%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second question is to show this navbar in all of your site's pages.<br>
This will require some server-side scripting like <code>PHP</code>.<br></p>

<p>I don't know where you at about this...<br>
