<p><strong>1. Why InterfaceB cannot implements InterfaceB?</strong></p>

<p>Because InterfaceB itself is an interface. Either you should extend InterfaceA or make InterfaceB concrete/abstract class.</p>

<p><strong>2. Why MyClass can leave InterfaceA's methods unimplemented?</strong></p>

<p>Really! If MyClass is not an abstract class, I don't think that's possible.</p>

<p><strong>3. To sum up, what's the purpuse of a structure like this one? When could it be useful?</strong></p>

<p>You can see Collection framework hierarchy, and you will get the idea.</p>
