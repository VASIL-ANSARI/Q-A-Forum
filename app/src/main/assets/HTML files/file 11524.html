<p>You cannot.<br>
You will need to assign some value to your array member which will indicate it is not initialized and then check for that value and treat it as blank while printing it out.</p>

<pre><code>if(onalg)
{
    B[i]=A[i];  
    C[i]= //Some place holder value indicating unfilled;
}
else
{
    C[i]=A[i]; 
    B[i]= //Some place holder value indicating unfilled;
}
</code></pre>
