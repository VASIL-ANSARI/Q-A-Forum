<p>The <code>exec</code> functions are variadic: they take a variable number of parameters so that you can pass a variable number of arguments to the command. The functions need to use <code>NULL</code> as a marker to mark the end of the argument list.</p>

<p>Within variadic functions is a loop that will iterate over the variable number of arguments. These loops need a terminating condition. In some cases, e.g. <code>printf</code>, the actual number of arguments can be inferred from another argument. In other functions, <code>NULL</code> is used to mark the end of the list.</p>

<p>Another option would be to add an additional function parameter for <em>number of arguments</em>, but that would make the code a little more brittle, requiring the programmer to manage an additional parameter, rather than simply always using a <code>NULL</code> as the final argument.</p>

<p>You'll also see <code>(char *) 0</code> used as the marker:</p>

<pre><code>execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", (char *) 0);
</code></pre>
