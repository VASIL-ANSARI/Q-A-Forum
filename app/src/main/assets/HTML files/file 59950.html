<p>in order to loop through a certain number of columns to the right of the 'code' column I would do something of the form</p>

<pre><code>for col in df.columns[3:]:
    plot(col)
</code></pre>

<p>However this only works if you can guarantee that your columns will always be in the same order. Alternatively you could make sure that the columns of interest for that particular chart are named in a systematic way.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
