<p>I had a the same problem with at table containing 100M rows and contacted Microsoft Support. This is the reply i got:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason why you canât create the index on your table is that you
  are facing a limitation on the platform that prevents to have
  transactions larger than 2GB. </p>
  
  <p>The creation of an index is a transactional operation that relies on
  the transaction log to execute the move of the table pages. More rows
  in a table means more pages to put in the T-Log. Since your table
  contains 100 million of records (which is quite a big number), it is
  easy for you to hit this limit.</p>
  
  <p>In order to  create the index we need to change the approach.
  Basically we are going to use a temporary(staging) table to store the
  data while you create the index on the source table, that you would
  have previously cleared from data.   </p>
  
  <p>Action Plan:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Create a staging table identical to the original table but without
  any index (this makes the staging table a heap)</li>
  <li>move the data from the original table to a staging table (the insert
      is faster because the staging table is a heap)</li>
  <li>empty the original table</li>
  <li>create the index on the original table (this time the transaction should be almost empty)</li>
  <li>move back data from staging table to original table (this would take some time, as the table contains indexes)</li>
  <li>delete the staging table</li>
  </ol>

<p>They suggest using <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162802.aspx">BCP</a> to move data between the staging table and the original table.</p>

<p>When looking in the event_log table...</p>

<pre><code>select * from sys.event_log 
where database_name ='&lt;DBName&gt;'
and event_type &lt;&gt; 'connection_successful'
order by start_time desc
</code></pre>

<p>.. I found this error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The session has been terminated because of excessive transaction log
  space usage. Try modifying fewer rows in a single transaction.</p>
