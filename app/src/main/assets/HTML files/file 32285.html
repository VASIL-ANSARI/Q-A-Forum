<p>A minor point, but <code>g_signal_connect()</code> is actually a macro which calls <code>g_signal_connect_data()</code> -- not that it really makes any difference. The parameter types you've listed are correct, though.</p>

<p>In C, any pointer type can be implicitly converted to a <code>void*</code> (aka <code>gpointer</code>), so no explicit casts are required at all. Indeed, the whole reason that the first parameter has type <code>gpointer</code> rather than <code>GObject*</code> is to save you having to do a manual cast. I haven't seen the book, but it strikes me that the convention the author has settled upon is rather... unusual, to say the least. I don't think I've seen any GObject code "in the wild" where this is done.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you are connecting one <code>GObject</code> to another -- for example, if the recipient of a signal is a <code>GtkWidget</code> -- then it's better to use <code>g_signal_connect_object()</code> rather than a plain <code>g_signal_connect()</code>. If you do this, it will ensure that the signal is automatically disconnected when the receiving object is destroyed, which otherwise you would need to handle manually in the receiver's destructor.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
