<p>Your main problem is that you've misplaced most of the contents of your <code>Donor</code> class. What you have is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Donor
{
    private String lastName;
}

public String getLastName()
{
    return lastName;
}
</code></pre>

<p>While what you want is more like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Donor
{
    private String lastName;

    public String getLastName()
    {
        return lastName;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All the members of the class need to be inside the curly braces that delimit the contents of the class, not just the fields.</p>

<p>Additionally you seem to be calling <code>super()</code> with arguments in a constructor that's meant for a class that doesn't have a superclass with a constructor that takes arguments. That doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Lastly you probably meant to make your <code>Donor</code> constructor public:</p>

<pre><code>public Donor(String lastName, ...
</code></pre>
