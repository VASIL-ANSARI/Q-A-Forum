<p>By default, Retrofit uses a non-daemon thread pool with a 60s core pool timeout. Very, very rarely do you want to use Retrofit's async <code>Callback</code> behavior in this manner.</p>

<p>If you are simply testing, you can call <code>setExecutors</code> on the <code>RestAdapter.Builder</code> and pass a synchronous executor as the first argument and <code>null</code> for the second. This will allow you to use the asynchronous API but get synchronous behavior in your tests.</p>

<p>And a synchronous executor, if you don't know how to make one:</p>

<pre><code>public final class SynchronousExecutor implements Executor {
  @Override public void execute(Runnable r) {
    r.run();
  }
}
</code></pre>
