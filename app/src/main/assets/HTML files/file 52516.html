<p>The very last lines of your code are not doing what you want them to do:</p>

<pre><code>        dic[key].append(xyz)
        del xyz[:]
</code></pre>

<p>You're appending a reference to your <code>xyz</code> list to the list in the dictionary, but they you're delting the list's contents. The <code>del</code> statement on the slice modifies the list in place, so the references stored in the dictionary will also see the empty list result afterwards.</p>

<p>In fact, all your empty inner lists in the dictionary are references to the same empty <code>xyz</code> list. What you probably want to do is to actually create a new list for <code>xyz</code>, rather than deleting its contents:</p>

<pre><code>        dic[key].append(xyz)
        xyz = []
</code></pre>

<p>Or, better yet, use a list comprehension to build the new list with its contents and get rid of the <code>xyz</code> variable entirely:</p>

<pre><code>    else:
        dic[key].append([float(num) for num in linelist])
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will include all three values from your file in the inner dictionaries. If you only want two, you probably want to slice <code>linelist</code>.</p>
