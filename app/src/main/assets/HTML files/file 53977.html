<p>Its difficult to say why it might be happening without a log, but a way to find it would be to use android monitor on android studio and see any kind of suspicious logs which could indicate why this might be happening. Also you need to be familiar with android debugging tools in order to debug this. A more general reason could be a system background service that might be running and waiting for results after the app closes.</p>
