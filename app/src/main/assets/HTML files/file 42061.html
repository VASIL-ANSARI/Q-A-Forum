<p>When there is a space in the date, for example <code>2014-12-11 13:08:08</code> then you must put quotes around it on the command line, otherwise the command prompt will see it as two separate arguments.</p>

<p>Ofcourse you can change your program so that the date and time will be handled as two separate arguments:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    String date = args[0];
    String time = args[1];

    System.out.println("The date is: " + date);
    System.out.println("The time is: " + time);

    String dateTime = date + " " + time;
    System.out.println("The date and time: " + dateTime);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(You can find out for yourself how to do that with args4j).</p>
