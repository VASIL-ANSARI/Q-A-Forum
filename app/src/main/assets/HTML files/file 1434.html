<p>The stream <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> performs formatted input even if you open the stream in binary mode. Formatted input expects to see strings of printable characters separated by spaces, but this is not what binary files like executables consist of. You need to read the file with the stream's <code>read()</code> function, and write it with the output stream's <code>write()</code> function.</p>
