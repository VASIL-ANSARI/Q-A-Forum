<p>If you're trying to just make it so that you click it once, and it animates the showing of it, just use.</p>

<pre><code>$("#testTab").show("slow");
</code></pre>

<p>If you're trying to make so that it toggles (click once it shows, click again and it hides, animation in both directions). Just use the toggle parameter, that's what it does:</p>

<pre><code>$("#testTab").toggle("slow");
</code></pre>
