<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>NSRange range = [country rangeOfString:searchtext];
if (range.location != NSNotFound)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>You also have the position (location) and length of your match (uninteresting in this case but might be interesting in others) in your range object. Note that <code>searchtext</code> must not be <code>nil</code>. If you are only interested in matching (and not the location) you can even condense this into</p>

<pre><code>if ([country rangeOfString:searchtext].location != NSNotFound)
{
}
</code></pre>
