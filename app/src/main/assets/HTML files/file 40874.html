<p>It depends on whether you need to search the data structure based on the key alone or both the key and the value.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you search by the key alone (i.e. <code>map.containsKey(key)</code>), you should use a <code>HashMap</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>If you search for existence of a key-value pair (i.e. <code>set.contains(new Pair(key,value)</code>), you should use a <code>HashSet</code> that contains those pairs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another thing to consider is how you determine the uniqueness of the elements. If it is determined by the key alone, you should use a <code>HashMap</code>. If it is determined by both key and value (i.e. you can have the same key appear twice with different values), you must use <code>HashSet</code>, since <code>HashhMap</code> doesn't allow the same key to appear more than once.</p>
