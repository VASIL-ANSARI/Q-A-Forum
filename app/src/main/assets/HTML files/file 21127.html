<p>The first question that may arise, if it's going to be used on a web platform or as a separate APP. Because at the moment iOS does not support WebGL natively. However there is a hack which permits to run on mobile browser. See this: <a href="http://vimeo.com/31553850" rel="nofollow">http://vimeo.com/31553850</a>. But i think this is out of scope if this will be a commercial product.</p>

<p>Secondly the canvas performance on mobile platform is not too good, but i found an experiment which i tested on iOS and it's quite satisfactory: <a href="http://media.chikuyonok.ru/ripple" rel="nofollow">http://media.chikuyonok.ru/ripple</a></p>
