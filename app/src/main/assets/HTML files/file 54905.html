<p>You could generate the 'new version' schema by pointing a copy of your app to the new db, then run db:schema:dump.  Then run a "diff" on the old vs new schema - keeping only the parts that changed.  Then use some regex-replacements in your editor (or awk) to change the actions to add_column operations, and put those changes into a migration.</p>

<p>At this point, you still need to change your models, controllers, and views to reflect the db-changes.  The diff could be handy for walking through those changes, as well.</p>
