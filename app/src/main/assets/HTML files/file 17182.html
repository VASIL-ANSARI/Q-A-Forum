<p>I believe your error is stemming from the fact that the <code>User</code> you are creating doesn't have a password.</p>

<p>Your <code>User</code> model validates a password and requires its presence, but when you create new a <code>User</code> from the command line, he/she doesn't have a password yet.</p>
