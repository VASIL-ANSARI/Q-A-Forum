<p>Digital Signature is the Encrypted (with private key) cipher of the Hash of the message.</p>

<p>Signature s = c(h(m))</p>

<p>Now s is attached to the message m. Signed message to be transmitted from Alice to Bob is m+s</p>

<p>After receiving m+s on Bob's side, Bob would decrypt the signature with Alice's public key which would be present in the certificate. So here he does d(s) = d(c(h(m)) = h(m)</p>

<p>Also the Bob received the message so he would compute the hash of the message m which is h(m)</p>

<p>Now he would compare the outputs from both the above steps to see if they match. This ensures the message has not been tampered with by anyone in between.</p>

<p>This is the general idea of how Digital signatures work. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has a graphical representation of the same process here:
