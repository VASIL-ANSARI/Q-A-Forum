<p>Prior to doing complex collision detection you should perform basic detection.</p>

<p>Using spheres or rectangles as bounding volumes is your best bet. Then if this detects a collision, move onto your more complex methods. </p>

<p>What I'm getting at is simple is often better, and quicker. Wrapping bounding volumes and splitting meshes up is costly, not to mention complex. You seem to be on the right track though.</p>

<p>As with game programming there are multiple ways of collision detection. My advice would be start simple. Take a cube and perfect your routines on that, then in theory you should be able to use any other model. As for examples I'd check <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/" rel="nofollow">gamedev.net</a> as they have some nice articles. Much or my home made collision detection is a combination of many methods, so I can't really recommended the definitive resource. </p>
