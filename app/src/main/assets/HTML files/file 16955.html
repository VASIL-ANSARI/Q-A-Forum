<p>What is it you want to prevent?  Do you want to prevent rotation?  If that is what you want, modify the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation return value in the RootViewController.m implementation file.</p>

<p>When I did this, the App was able to keep the same page (month) even after rotating the device.   I used the simulator and tried on both iPhone and iPad.  On the iPad, in landscape mode, it showed two months at a time, but then when rotated back to portrait, still kept the first of the two months that was displayed.  This was when I incremented to June.  I used the default project without changing a line of code.</p>
