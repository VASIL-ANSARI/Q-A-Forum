<p>Sorry but we have made no effort to make that particular combination work and are unlikely to try. The possible MS technology combinations are endless. We live in DLL hell as it is and we can only support what we perceive to be the main paths.</p>

<p>However, Breeze is all open source and you are welcome to try it yourself. The source code is in the repo. Have at it.</p>
