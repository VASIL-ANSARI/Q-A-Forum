<p>You can have a file containing the content and then just reading it and seeding your db:</p>

<pre><code>file_content = File.read('path to file with extension');
MyModel.create(text: file_content);
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, if you have multiple items you need to seed, just loop over them with the right file name or by all file in certain directory.</p>
