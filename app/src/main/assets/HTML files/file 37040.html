<p><strong>So you are using Ruby 1.9.3 to run a rails 2.3.5 application. If you look at <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html#ruby-1-9-1-support" rel="nofollow">rails 2.3 docs</a>, you can't run a rails 2.3.5 app in ruby 1.9.3 and you'll have to install ruby 1.8 or 1.9.1 to run your project</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fix</strong></p>

<p>If you are using rvm then you can install ruby 1.8.7 as it's a stable version by :</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.8.7
</code></pre>
