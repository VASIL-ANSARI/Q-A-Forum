<p>Try changing:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click','.push',function(){
</code></pre>

<p>For:</p>

<pre><code>$('.push').on('click', function(){
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case the event handler is added to every element with the "push" class that is present in the DOM at the moment of the execution of the "click" function. The second case, the one wich uses the "on" function, it adds the event handler to the elements already present and those which are not yet in the DOM, those which you create after the execution of the adition like the ones you add to the table.</p>

<p>Wish i make my self clear, i am trying to improve my english.</p>
