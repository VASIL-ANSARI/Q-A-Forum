<p><code>url_for</code> disregards nils in an array so <code>[@variable_that_is_nil, @draw]</code> is the same as <code>[@draw]</code> or just <code>@draw</code>.  so it is fine to use <code>[@child, @draw]</code> in <code>form_for</code>.  You just have to add some conditionals inside the form to have a select for a list of children (might be confusing but I'm referring to the list of child ids to select from) if @child is not declared.</p>
