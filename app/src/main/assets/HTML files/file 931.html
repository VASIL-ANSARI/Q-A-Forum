<p>You could use reflection to iterate over the members and invoke HasChanges and AcceptChanges.  The Record class could store the reflection metadata as a static so there is no per-instance memory overhead.  However, the performance cost at runtime is going to be huge -- you might also end up boxing and unboxing the column which would add even more to the cost.</p>
