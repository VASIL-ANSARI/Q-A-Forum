<p>The first strcpy is okay</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(word, "hello\0extra");
</code></pre>

<p>You create a <code>char</code> array constant and pass the pointer to <code>strcpy</code>. All characters (including the first \0) is copied, the remainder is ignored.</p>

<p>But wait... You have some extra characters. This makes your const data section a bit larger. Could be a problem in embedded environment where flash space is rare. But there is no run-time problem.</p>
