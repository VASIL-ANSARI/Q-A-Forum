<p>For <code>ios</code> 7 and lower, you can use <a href="http://www.appcoda.com/search-bar-tutorial-ios7/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial. It's very easy to follow and very straightforward.</p>

<p>But if you need it for <code>ios</code> 8, due to the fact that a lot of things got deprecated, you can use <a href="https://github.com/dempseyatgithub/Sample-UISearchController" rel="nofollow">this</a> class from github.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!!</p>
