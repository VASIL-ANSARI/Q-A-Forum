<p>The C++ preprocessor basically takes all your <code>#include</code> directives and basically pastes them into one long stream for the compiler.</p>

<p>You may not have included it here, but it was probably included somewhere else earlier.  For correctness, you should include it also, however. Creating implicit dependencies can make your code hard to maintain and fragile (when it comes to build errors), so avoid them wherever you see them.</p>
