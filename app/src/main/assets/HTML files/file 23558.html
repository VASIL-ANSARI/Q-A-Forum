<p>This is not a full answer, just evidence to the negative.</p>

<p>Apart from never encountering such a powerful library I have googled a little and found no results other than jStat. However I have found a page (<a href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/stat-data/Javastat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/stat-data/Javastat.htm</a>) where some client-side statistical calculations can be performed. This is not a library, and I have had a look at some of their javascript and it seems like they have coded the calculations by hand (which I wouldn't expect if a library existed)</p>

<p>So at best I offer some evidence to the negative.</p>

<p>(Also note the rather inconclusive post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4742393/recommend-a-good-javascript-statistics-library">Recommend a good javascript statistics library?</a>)</p>

<p>I wouldn't want to do heavy numerical integration in javascript though, can't you do that on the server-side instead, especially if the user is merely selecting data, and not entering it?</p>
