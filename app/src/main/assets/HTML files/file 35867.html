<p>DirectShow (now part of Windows SDK) provides editing services (EDS) but I would suggest  ffmpeg (<a href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/" rel="nofollow">http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/</a>) as a better choice since it would support wider range of formats (e.g. H.264 - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd390353%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd390353(v=vs.85).aspx</a>).</p>
