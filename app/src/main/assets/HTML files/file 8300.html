<p>I am working on this right now.  Part of the issue is that there are a number of bugs around the Zenoss Administered Objects concept.  I have posted some findings at the Zenoss forum at <a href="http://community.zenoss.org/message/59100#59100" rel="nofollow">http://community.zenoss.org/message/59100#59100</a> . I have also opened a number of tickets with Zenoss (referenced in the previous url).  If you can add extra supporting information to the tickets then it may get their priority raised.  Meanwhile, I am working on my own code fixes / ZenPack workaround and almost have something ready for alpha testing if you are interested.
Cheers,
Jane </p>
