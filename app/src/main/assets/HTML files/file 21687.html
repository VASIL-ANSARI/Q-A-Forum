<p>Sounds like you'll need to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142571.aspx" rel="nofollow">Full-Text Search</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Full-Text Search in SQL Server lets users and applications run
  full-text queries against character-based data in SQL Server tables. </p>
  
  <p>... </p>
  
  <p>These columns can have any of the following data types: <code>char</code>, <code>varchar</code>,
  <code>nchar</code>, <code>nvarchar</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>ntext</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>xml</code>, or <code>varbinary(max)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only will you need a full-text index in order to be able to add the index the large text column... but if you will be searching this large block of text for partial matches, such as searching for a specific word or a phrase in the middle of a large document, a normal index would be useless, since a leading wildcard (i.e. <code>WHERE TextField LIKE '%Specific word or phrase%'</code>) in your search would prevent the use of a non-full-text index.</p>
