<p>Alas, the <code>OUTPUT</code> clause is not designed to output something not going into the target table (or coming from the table in the case of an <code>update</code>).</p>

<p>If you modify <code>Data</code> to have a dummy column for the old id, then you can output it.</p>

<p>In fact, if the table is not large, you could consider adding the column for the insert and then dropping it afterwards.</p>
