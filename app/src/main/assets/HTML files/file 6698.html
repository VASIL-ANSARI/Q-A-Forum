<p>I have experienced the same problem with a proxy and I fell short of solving the issue using cURL's error handlers. If you have access to both scripts (the one requesting and the one delivering the XML) have the requesting one deliver a unique code which it expects at the end of the XML:</p>

<pre><code>// Request
http://localhost/getxml.php?id=4&amp;uniq=1337
</code></pre>

<p>And append a comment at the end of the output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml encoding="..." ..?&gt;
...
&lt;!--1337--&gt;
</code></pre>
