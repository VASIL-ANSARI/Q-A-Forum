<p>A free function is already independent from objects. In C++ <code>static</code> has a few different meanings. For free functions, <code>static</code> means that the function has internal linkage, meaning it is only visible in the current translation unit (cpp file + headers).</p>

<p>Since your function is declared in a header you don't want the <code>static</code> keyword, otherwise every file that includes it will need to implement it (they essentially get there own version of the function). You also shouldn't define it in the header - leave it as <code>void debug();</code>. Define it in a cpp file instead.</p>
