<p>First of all. Lots of thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/19308/joshua-drake">Joshua Drake</a>, who provided this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lucian/archive/2011/11/01/async-ctp-v3-installation.aspx" rel="nofollow">link</a>. Firstly I recognized that my file versions didn't match up with the ones, which should have been there. I reinstalled without any success. Afterwards I've noticed the following paragraph on this site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run Windows Update before installing Async CTP v3, and get all updates
  (including Optional updates) from before October 2011</p>
  
  <p>BUT NONE that came after. Three in particular, <strong>KB2635973</strong> and <strong>KB2615527</strong> and <strong>KB2645410</strong>, are known to be <strong>incompatible</strong> with Async CTP
  v3.</p>
  
  <p>After installing Async CTP v3, then you can get subsequent updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's been the clue. After uninstalling the three mentioned updates, I reinstalled Async CTP again and it worked. Thanks a lot!</p>
