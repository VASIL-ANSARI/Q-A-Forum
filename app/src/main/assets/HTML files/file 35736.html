<p>I do not understand why the error I described in question happens but
no one has provided a proper answer yet so I'll tell about workarounds I came up with. Maybe it will help somebody.</p>

<p>I found two ways to make Visual Studio create Service References I need while preserving all the operations I want.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Error disappears if I rename <code>ResponceMsgContract2.Length</code> to 
<code>ResponceMsgContract2.Length2</code> so that <code>ResponceMsgContract2</code> and 
<code>ResponseMsgContract1</code> do not have message headers with same name.
Why this helps is still a mystery to me. Maybe it's WCF bug.</p></li>
<li><p>Error disappears if I split IMyService1 to two interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyService1_1
{
   [OperationContract]
   ResponseMsgContract1 Operation1(RequestMsgContract1 arguments);
}

[ServiceContract]
interface IMyService1_2
{
   [OperationContract]
   ResponceMsgContract2 Operation2();
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Both variants are not good solutions and there may be situations when you can't apply any of them. But at least it's something.</p>
