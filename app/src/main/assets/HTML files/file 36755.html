<p>You provided random data, so there is no way we can get the exact number that you got. But based on what you just described, I think the following will do:</p>

<pre><code>In [121]:

(df.Price/df.Signal).groupby(df.Sector).sum()
Out[121]:
Sector
auto     -1.693373
retail   -5.137694
tech     -0.984826
dtype: float64
</code></pre>
