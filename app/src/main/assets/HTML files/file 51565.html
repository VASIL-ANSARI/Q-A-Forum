<p>Not sure if this will help you, but I ran into a similar situation this morning. Turned out that in my ClickOnce application I had to add the following to my app.manifest file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;requestedExecutionLevel level="asInvoker" uiAccess="false" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should go in the assembly/security/requestedPrivileges node.</p>
