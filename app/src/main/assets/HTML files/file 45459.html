<p>I think the better approach would be: Use a class based views and inherit all your views from the same base class that has the facilities you are trying to add.</p>

<p>However if you want to decorate all your views in your application the approach would be following</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a <code>scan()</code> method which takes Python module as input and reads through, a bit similar to Pyramid's own scan</p></li>
<li><p>If your <code>scan()</code> finds a view function signature, it decorates the function and replaces the original function in the module in-place</p></li>
<li><p>Call your custom scan before letter Pyramid itself scan the module, so that Pyramid will pick up "fixed" functions</p></li>
</ul>
