<p>I cannot think of a logical explanation for that behaviour.  If the facts are as you report them, then I agree that error message text is the wrong way around.</p>

<p>So what are the alternatives?</p>

<ul>
<li>You could be misreading the log files.</li>
<li>You could be looking at the wrong version of the source code.</li>
<li>You could have found a bug ... though that seems unlikely for something as fundamental as this.  (In theory, the bug could be an incorrect error message coming from the VM, an incorrect line number in the stacktrace, or even a compiler bug that is cause it to do the wrong type cast.)</li>
<li>It is even possible that the exception stacktrace is a fake ... though that explanation borders on paranoia.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try running the code under a debugger, and single stepping through that section of the code to confirm your belief about the cause and source of the exception.</li>
<li>Create an SSCE for this behaviour and see if other people can reproduce it.</li>
</ul>
