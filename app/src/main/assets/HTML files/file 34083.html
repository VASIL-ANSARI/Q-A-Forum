<p>Protocol design, if done well, always has an eye on the future.</p>

<p>Though <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSession_class/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">we're only using NSURLSession for HTTP right now</a>, it might be possible in the future to use it for other networking protocols. It wouldn't surprise me if you could use it for FTP at some point, for example.</p>

<p>Using a simple response base class for the completion block/delegate parameter and letting you cast based on what kind of network protocol you know you're using gives NSURLSession flexibility for the future.</p>

<p>If a new networking protocol emerges with different needsâperhaps it doesn't even <em>have</em> an integer status code in its response, sayâApple can just add another subclass of NSURLResponse, and leave everything else the same, including the signature of the completion handler block and all the <code>NSURLSession*Delegate</code> protocols.</p>

<p>If they'd "hard coded" the network protocols and completion handler blocks to use <code>NSHTTPURLResponse</code>, then how would you cleanly add a new network protocol, say FTP, to NSURLSession?</p>

<p>(NB: By "protocol", as opposed to "networking protocol"âI use both terms in this answerâI mean the design of the interfaces of the NSURLSession classes, including their actual <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html" rel="nofollow">protocols</a> and equivalent completion handlers.)</p>
