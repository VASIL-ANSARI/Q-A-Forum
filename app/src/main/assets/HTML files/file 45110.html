<p>Assuming that you've tried the command in your shell and it worked.
If you set <code>shell=True</code> in <code>subprocess.call()</code>, it's recommended to use a string instead of a sequence (a tuple in your case) as the first argument.</p>

<p>If you use <code>shell=True</code> and pass a sequence as the first argument, the arguments from the second onwards will be treated as the parameters for the shell itself.</p>

<p>You can rewrite as below</p>

<pre><code>cmd = 'i2cset -y 0 0x20 0x14 0x01'
subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)
</code></pre>
