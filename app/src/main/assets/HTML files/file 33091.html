<p>A binary tree (B-tree) has logarithmic insertion and retrieval (equivalent to depth count) time in the average case and is naturally sorted when walked in-order.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a B-tree insertion/retrieval time might degenerate to linear if the tree is unbalanced (worst case). If this is an issue, you should consider a Red-Black tree, which does not eliminate the problem, but mitigates it while keeping the insertion time logarithmic in the size of the tree.</p>

<p>Neither STL nor Boost implement a B- or RB- tree, although <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map" rel="nofollow"><code>std::map</code></a> is <em>usually</em> implemented as a RB.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that a linked list has linear insertion time, even if double.</p>
