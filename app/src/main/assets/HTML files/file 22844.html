<p>This is C# code that will find your table names in the example:</p>

<pre><code>var matches = Regex.Matches(yourString, @"(from|inner\s+join|left\s+outer\s+join)\s+[a-zA-Z0-9]+\s*\.\s*(?&lt;table&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(\s+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?(\s*,\s*[a-zA-Z0-9]+\s*\.\s*(?&lt;table&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(\s+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?)*", RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture);
foreach (Match match in matches)
{
    foreach (Capture capture in match.Groups["table"].Captures)
    {
        string tableName = capture.Value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The same regex will at least get you pointed in the right direction in Perl, as regex is mostly cross-compatible.</p>

<p>Edit: Updated to (clumsily?) find multiple tables separated by commas, and incorporate Alan's suggestions to use <code>"table"</code> to find the groups and mark <code>ExplicitCapture</code>.  If you run into many more problems, you might want to do as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/281041/regular-expression-to-find-all-table-names-in-a-query">Regular expression to find all table names in a query</a> and find a SQL parser instead of trying to use regex.</p>
