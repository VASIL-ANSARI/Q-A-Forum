<p>Although not particularly a solution for your original question, you could get around using setTimeout by attaching a eventListener to the portWV, firing on the 'load' event.</p>

<pre><code>portWV.addEventListener('load', function() {
    landWV.url = imageData;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, one possible solution could be to use only one web view and check for orientation changes to adjust its size...</p>
