<p>You can't patch it twice like that.  You'll have to patch it once, with an object that returns different values on subsequent calls.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>fake_input = iter(['1 2 3', '4 5 6']).__next__

@patch("builtins.input", fake_input)
def test_compare(self):
    ...
</code></pre>
