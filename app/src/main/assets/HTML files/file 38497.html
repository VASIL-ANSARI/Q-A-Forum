<p>The { syntax is only valid when you're initializing and declaring an array at the same time.
After declaring it, you need to use the complete syntax:</p>

<pre><code>foo[0][0] = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>Technically speaking, C only has one-dimensional arrays. You create multidemnsional arrays by making arrays of arrays. The name of an array is converted to a pointer to its first element, and only the outer array is converted to a pointer. It's a pointer to an array of MAX ints, or int(*)[MAX].</p>
