<p>I don't see any requirement to have additional <code>Action</code> parameter. The problem come probably from the misunderstanding which data are requested from the server by jqGrid in every standard request. The problem is that sorting, paging and filtering should be <em>always</em> analyzed and applied by the web server and <em>all the "actions" can be combined together</em>.</p>

<p>For example you show data from the database in the grid having two columns: product name and the unit price of every product. Let us you sort the grid by product name as the initial jqGrid option (<code>sortname</code> is <code>'ProductName'</code>) and you use the default value for <code>rowNum</code>: 20. After the initial grid filling the user set the filter to get products with the price less then $100. In the case the <code>_search</code> parameter will be set to <code>true</code> and the <code>filters</code> will be set to the string where the filter is encoded in JSON format (see <a href="http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki%3aadvanced_searching#options" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>). So the web method of your web service will be called with the parameters <code>_search = true</code>, <code>filters = some value</code>, <code>page = 1</code>, <code>rows = 20</code>, <code>sidx ='ProductName'</code> and <code>sord = 'asc'</code>. Let us the resulting list will be 55 products. So you will have 3 pages of the results and the web service have to return the first page corresponds to the input parameter <code>page = 1</code>. Then the user can type manually 3 as the page number and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the user can click on the header of the 'Price' column to sort the products by price. In any way ythe web method will receive new request with new values of <code>page</code>, <code>rows</code>, <code>sidx</code>, <code>sord</code>, <code>_search</code> parameters and optionally with the <code>filters</code> parameter.</p>

<p>So the server should <em>always</em> test whether <code>_search</code> is <code>true</code>. In the case the server should apply the filter to the original SQL query which get all products. Then the results have to be <em>always</em> sorted corresponds to the value from <code>sidx</code> and <code>sord</code> parameters. At the end the web server should calculates the total number of the <em>filtered resulting rows</em> and return it as the value of the <code>records</code> output parameter. In the same way the web service should calculates the total number of the <em>filtered pages</em> and return it in the <code>total</code> output parameter. At the end the web service should return up to <code>rows</code> records (one page) based on the values of input parameters <code>page</code> and <code>rows</code>.</p>

<p>I tried to explained that you really don't need to define "GetAll", "Sort", "Filter", "NextPage" etc action and the web service should just always take in consideration <em>all input parameters</em>.</p>

<p>By the way if you want rename and input parameter you can use <code>prmNames</code> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7050224/315935">here</a>). In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3161542/315935">the old answer</a> I explained how you can implement call of the web service directly using <code>datatype: 'json'</code> instead of <code>datatype</code> as function.</p>
