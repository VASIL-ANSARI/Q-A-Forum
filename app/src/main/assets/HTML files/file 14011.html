<p><code>UPDATE</code> queries do not return result objects, it returns <code>TRUE</code> (assuming success). You're then trying to call <code>TRUE-&gt;fetch_array()</code>, which obviously won't work.</p>

<p>Now, for doing what you actually want to do, try this:</p>

<pre><code>$row = $mysqli-&gt;query("SELECT.....")-&gt;fetch_array();
</code></pre>
