<p>That method you've got above is called for a single row's change, and not for all. (So the 'row' variable) isn't useful outside of the row that was just changed. You'll want to call <code>selectedRowInComponent:</code></p>

<pre><code>NSString *chosenType = [rowOneItems objectAtIndex:[pickerView selectedRowInComponent:0]];
NSString *chosenDifficulty = [rowTwoItems objectAtIndex:[pickerView selectedRowInComponent:1]];
NSString *chosenDuration = [rowThreeItems objectAtIndex:[pickerView selectedRowInComponent:2]];
</code></pre>
