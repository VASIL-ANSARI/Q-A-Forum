<p>No, they are not shared. On each request completely new object is being created. Keep in mind that HTTP is stateless protocol. And that's the reason why many people consider Singleton as anti-pattern <sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p>So, basically if you have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass {

    public function __construct() {
        // any action
    }

    public function anyMethod() {
        // any code
    }

}

$obj = new MyClass;
</code></pre>

<p><code>$obj</code> is created from the scratch for each request. Actually, that's not everything. Your whole application is "created" from the scratch.</p>
