<p>Have you considered looking at the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html" rel="nofollow">JavaDoc for RestTemplate</a>?</p>

<p>There is the corresponding <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html#getForObject%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Class,%20java.util.Map%29" rel="nofollow"><code>getForObject</code></a> methods that are the HTTP GET equivalents of <code>postForObject</code>, but they doesn't appear to fulfil your requirements of "GET with headers", as there is no way to specify headers on any of the calls.</p>

<p>Looking at the JavaDoc, no method that is HTTP GET specific allows you to also provide header information.  There are alternatives though, one of which you have found and are using.  The <code>exchange</code> methods allow you to provide an <code>HttpEntity</code> object representing the details of the request (including headers).  The <code>execute</code> methods allow you to specify a <code>RequestCallback</code> from which you can add the headers upon its invocation.</p>
