<p>Your client tries to connect to INADDR_ANY, which cant be right. Call connect() to the address you give as an command line argument.</p>

<p>Other than that, it is difficult to say, since the code is not very <a href="http://www.sscce.org/" rel="nofollow">SSCCE</a>. As the comments suggest, try cleaning it up. Remove calls like <code>initSem();</code> (or display their code) and structures such as <code>clientsFd[counterThread]</code></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Removed advice about <code>accept()</code>, my bad.</p>
