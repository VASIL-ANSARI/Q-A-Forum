<p>It sounds like the structure you really want is <code>std::deque</code> which can be appended in ammortized constant time.</p>

<p>Actually, the resizing strategy is exactly the one already used by <code>std::vector</code>.  In fact the precise strategy it uses means that this operation is essentially O(1), but only in terms of many appends over a long period of time.  At any rate, there doesn't seem to be any reason to reinvent the wheel on this.  just use <code>std::vector.push_back()</code> or <code>std::queue.push_back()</code></p>
