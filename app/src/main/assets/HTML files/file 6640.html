<p>Your array has 4 elements and your index is out of range so you are just stomping on memory.</p>

<p>Given the code here, I'd expect <code>arr[4]</code> to reset the array, but since you mentioned that it's of length <code>N</code> and <code>N+2</code> is what causes it, there might be some padding in your stack.  In any case, when you declare the array and <code>j</code>, they are put on the stack.  In your case, <code>j</code> is in a position such that when your index is out of bounds you are accessing the memory where <code>j</code> is.</p>
