<p>I'm not certain, as from your code and looking at the cocos2d code I can't see a definite reason why this would be happening, but given the number of sprites you've got on the screen, i'd definitely take a look at my answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8633702/cocos2d-android-texure-issue-on-motorola-xoom/10335955#10335955">this</a> question as you may well be hitting one of cocos2d's quirky little rendering faults around multiple sprites.  can't hurt to try spritesheets, and it's certainly the correct way to actually do sprites in cocos.</p>

<p>also, definitely create yourself a helper utility to determine the scaling ratio of a device compared to your original image sizes, as unlike on iphone, android does have a pretty much unlimited variation of screen resolutions, and a simple bit of "scale as you load" utility code now will save you lots of time in the future if you want to use this on any other device.</p>
