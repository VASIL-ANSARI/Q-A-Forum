<p>You could include the images in <code>IMG</code> elements elsewhere on the page and have them in a hidden container (<code>display:none</code> or <code>visibility:hidden</code> in the CSS) so they are loaded when the page first loads, but not visible. This should serve to <em>cache</em> the hovered image client side so you don't get the delay when the browser requests the :hover image referenced in the CSS.</p>

<p>I would be inclined to use the same file path in the <code>IMG</code> <code>SRC</code> attribute that you use in the CSS to ensure the browser sees it as the same image.</p>

<p>That's if the JavaScript solution isn't working for you.</p>

<p>From your example above...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Cache Images --&gt;
&lt;div style="display:none"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8808984/2.0/SegmentThumbs/549933.gif" alt=""&gt;
&lt;img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8808984/2.0/SegmentThumbs/549841.gif" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>There is an additional problem with animated GIFs that <em>might</em> affect you, depending on the animation... Regardless of whether the animated (hover) image is preloaded or not, once it is loaded, browsers tend to play the image in the background regardless of whether it is currently displayed or not. So, moving off the image and back over it again results in the animation 'jumping' to its current position, rather than continuing from where the animation had got to when you moved off the image. More noticeable with long animations rather than short ones.</p>
