<p>As I understand it, a java String instance is final (immutable), so that even if the JSON object is a very long string, the String class only calculates the hashCode of the String once (at construction time or first use i can't remember) - and keeps it as an instance attribute for the lifetime of the String. So there is no problem (in terms of performance penalty) using the JSON object both as the key and value in a concurrent HashMap. This is exactly what the same as how a java "Set" works, being backed by a Map.</p>
