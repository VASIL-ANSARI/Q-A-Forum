<p>The issue is in how your chart/data is set up.</p>

<p>You are currently aggregating all the data from column 2 to generate the chart. In this case you have 7 Urbana, and 3 Rural for your values, so it aggregates those 10 rows into two categories. Since each slice of the pie refers to a set of aggregate values, and pie charts only allow a single value to be selected, you can't get the selection of three rows that way.</p>

<p>Additionally, your category selector doesn't provide much use as it currently is, because if you select either Urbana or Rural, you end up getting a pie chart showing 100% of a single category.</p>

<p>If you set up your data differently, you will properly get an array of objects whenever you select a slice, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code>function drawVisualization() {
  // Create and populate the data table.
  var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
    ['Task', 'Hours per Day'],
    ['Work', 11],
    ['Eat', 2],
    ['Commute', 2],
    ['Watch TV', 2],
    ['Sleep', 7]
  ]);

  // Create and draw the visualization.
  pieChart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('visualization'));
  pieChart.draw(data, {title:"So, how was your day?"});
  google.visualization.events.addListener(pieChart, 'select', onAreaSliceSelected);
}

function onAreaSliceSelected(){
  var sel = pieChart.getSelection(); //is always null
  alert('you selected '+sel); //displays you selected null
}
</code></pre>
