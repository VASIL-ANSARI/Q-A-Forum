<p>PHP's Math library has a round method:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.round.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.round.php</a></p>

<p>So in this case, you would call round on the result and specify you want it to one decimal place:</p>

<pre><code>$rounded_value = round($result,1);
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is the value you want to round, the second is the number of decimal places - you can leave it blank or use 0 if you want no decimal places.</p>
