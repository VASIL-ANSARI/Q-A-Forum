<p>I had the same problem. It is related to the id allocating strategies of Hibernate. Whe n you choose <em>GenerationType.SEQUENCE</em>, Hibernate uses HiLo strategy which allocates IDs in blocks of 50 by default. So you can explicitly set <em>allocationSize</em> value like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Id 
@SequenceGenerator(name="pk_sequence",sequenceName="entity_id_seq", allocationSize=1)
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE,generator="pk_sequence")
@Column(name="id", unique=true, nullable=false)
public int getId() {
    return this.id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Though, I've also heard opinions that using HiLo strategy with <em>allocationSize=1</em> is not a good practice. Some people recommend to use <em>GenerationType.AUTO</em> instead when you have to deal with database-managed sequences</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did end up going with allocationSize=1, and things seem to work as I expect now.  My application is such that I don't really need blocks of IDs anyway, so <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/YMMV">YMMV</a>.</p>
