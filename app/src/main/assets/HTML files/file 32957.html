<p>The error is telling you exactly the problem -- your class has no method named <code>readfile</code>. It looks like you have indented the method incorrectly, causing it to be private to the <code>update_count</code> method. The solution is to remove one level of indentation to the function definition, so that it is in the proper scope. </p>
