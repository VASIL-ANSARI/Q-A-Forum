<p>Assuming you have an object before you create this array you don't need to convert this to anything. Using jQuery's each you can get the value and the key.</p>

<pre><code>$.each( obj, function( key, value ) {
  alert( key + ": " + value );
});
</code></pre>

<p>If this is the final output then you can just use String.prototype.split when you loop through.</p>
