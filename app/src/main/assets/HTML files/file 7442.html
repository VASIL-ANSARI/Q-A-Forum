<p>The most common it would be modifying your collection</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var item in collection)
{
  //the following statements would generate an error.
  collection.Add(new Item());
  collection.Remove(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>you cannot modify your collection structure while enumerating through it.
You can modify the items inside the collection, not the collection.</p>

<p>Another error you might have is if the collection is null. It is a good idea to check if a collection is null before enumerating.</p>

<p>I think getting any other error is because the logic inside the statement is wrong, not because you are in a foreach loop.</p>
