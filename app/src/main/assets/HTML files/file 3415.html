<p>Two tables may refer each other with FK so not always possible to create and insert "parent first".</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqldump.html" rel="nofollow">mysqldump</a> . It will disable foreign keys before importing data and enable afterward. (this is also much faster).</p>
