<p>Sounds like a stupid requirement, but anyway: You can change the language of your app by setting an array with the order of preferred languages for the user defaults key @"AppleLanguages", e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>//Set language to German:
NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
[defaults setObject:[NSArray arrayWithObject:@"de"]
                                      forKey:@"AppleLanguages"];
</code></pre>

<p>Note however that this only affects strings/nibs you load <em>afterwards</em>, so you might need to reload your UI after changing the setting.</p>
