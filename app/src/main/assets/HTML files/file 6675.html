<p>Tried replicating your problem, and had the same issue. Moved the pluralization rule into the locale file, and worked fine.</p>

<p>Switched the locale file over to the Ruby-style, as the regular YAML didn't seem to like my lambda for some reason.</p>

<pre><code># config/initializers/locale.rb
I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Pluralization)

# config/locales/ru.rb
{
  :ru =&gt; {
    :user =&gt; {
      :one   =&gt; "One User",
      :few   =&gt; "Few Users",
      :many  =&gt; "Many Users",
      :other =&gt; "Other Users"
    },
    :i18n =&gt; {
      :plural =&gt; {
        :rule =&gt; lambda { |n| :few }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Testing
$ script/console 
  Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.8)
  &gt;&gt; I18n.locale = :ru; I18n.t("user", :count =&gt; 20) #=&gt; "Few Users"
</code></pre>

<p>might give that a try and see if it helps</p>
