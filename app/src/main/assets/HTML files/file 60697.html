<p>I find no reason in being able to train neural network with panel data. What neural network does is that it maps one set of values with other set of values who have non-linear relation. In a time series a value at a particular instance depends on previous occuring values. Example: your pronunciation of a letter may vary depending on what letter you pronounced just earlier. For time series prediction Recurrent Neural Network outperforms feed-forward neural networks. How we train time series with  a regular feed-forward network is illustrated in this picture. <a href="http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/neural-network-prediction/images/train.gif" rel="nofollow">Image</a></p>

<p>In RNN we can create a feedback loop in the internal states of the network and that's why RNN is better at predicting time series.
In your example data one thing to consider : do values of x1, x2, x3 have effect on y1 or vice-versa ? If it doesn't then you can train your model as such x1,x2,x3, y4 are same type of data i.e train them independently using same network (subject to experimentation). If your target is to predict a value where their values of one has effect on another i.e correlated you can convert them to one dimensional data where single time frame contains all variants of sample type. Another way might be   train four neural networks where first three map their time series using RNN and last one is a feed-forward network which takes 2 inputs from 2 time series output and maps to 3rd time series output and do this for all possible combinations. (still subject to experimentation as we can't surely predict the performance of neural network model without experimenting)</p>
