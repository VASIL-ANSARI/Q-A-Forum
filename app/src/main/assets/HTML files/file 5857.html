<p>You can create a dialog as your main window.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are using MFC in Visual Studio, use the project wizard to create a Dialog-Based app.</p>

<p>(File -> New Project -> Visual C++ / MFC -> MFC Application -> OK -> Application Type -> Dialog based.)</p>

<p>The generated application will then create your main dialog for you, and exit when it closes.</p>

<p>A simple example of such a beast, including source, is here:</p>

<li><p>If you are using straight Win32, you'd create the dialog using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645445%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">CreateDialogParam</a> (or similar) and then show it like any other window, and run a message loop. (Or you could use DoModal, which runs its own message loop, but beware that modal dialogs need to behave slightly differently, especially when it comes to closing.)</p>

<p>A simple example of that, including source, is here:</p>

</ol>

<p>(Those are both programs I wrote, but very simple ones, so there's not much to get in the way of understanding what they do.)</p>
