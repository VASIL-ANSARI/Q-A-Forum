<p>This should be possible using the default layered nav widgets from WooCommerce. The key is to found out which URL is generated when you pick the options you want to have selected by clicking on these. An URL should be shown in your address bar similar to;</p>

<p><a href="http://asdf.com/shop/?filtering=1&amp;filter_attribute=1234" rel="nofollow">http://asdf.com/shop/?filtering=1&amp;filter_attribute=1234</a></p>

<p>Copy this URL and replace the link to your shop archive - assuming it is in your menu - under Appearance > Menus in the WordPress Dashboard with a Custom Link that points to this URL.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you out, good luck!</p>
