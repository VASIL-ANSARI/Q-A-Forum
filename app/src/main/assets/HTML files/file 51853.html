<p>When iterating on databinded control you'll always get its underlying data.</p>

<p>You should <code>Style.Triggers</code> to alter UI based on data (changing background, showing/hiding controls, etc.).</p>

<p>However, there is a way to go with altering UI from C# but that would make XAML and code-behind tightly coupled => that introduces more complexity into your code - simply believe me, it is not what you want/need.</p>
