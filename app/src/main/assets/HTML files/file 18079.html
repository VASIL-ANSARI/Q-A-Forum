<p>Check the return value of scanf. From the man page of scanf:</p>

<pre><code>RETURN VALUE
   These functions return the number of input items  successfully  matched
   and assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero in the
   event of an early matching failure.

   The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached before  either
   the  first  successful conversion or a matching failure occurs.  EOF is
   also returned if a read error occurs, in which case the error indicator
   for  the  stream  (see ferror(3)) is set, and errno is set indicate the
   error.
</code></pre>

<p>To keep reading data until you get some, do:</p>

<pre><code>while(scanf("%f", &amp;customNumber) == 0);
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to fail if the user enters bad data, the do:</p>

<pre><code>if(scanf("%f", &amp;customNumber) == 0)
    break;
</code></pre>
