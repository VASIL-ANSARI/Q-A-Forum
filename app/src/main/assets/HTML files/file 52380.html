<p>Create a new table UserRating with userid, songid and rating columns. Probably a date column too, for when they rated it. Table with <code>FKUserID int, FKSongID int, Rating it, RankDate datetime</code>. </p>

<p>Then you can use <code>select songs.id, AVG(Rating) from songs inner join UserRating on UserRating.FKSongID = songs.ID group by songs.id</code> Which will give you all songs by their average ranking. </p>

<p>Or if you need all songs rated by a user <code>Select * from users inner join UserRating on UserRating.FKUserID = user.ID</code> </p>

<p>or if you need all songs rated higher than 5 
<code>select * from songs inner join UserRating on UserRating.FKSongID = Songs.ID where rating &gt; 5</code> etc etc</p>
