<p>This isn't something you would do in the Entity Framework <em>per se</em>.  The Entity Framework is about the persistance and retreival of your data from an underlying data store, not about the logic you apply to that data.</p>

<p>What I would recommend is that you either have a stored procedure that saves the data and then re-queries the data, performing the calculations necessary after you re-fetch it in the sproc, or fetch the data in your business layer and then perform the calculations on the data returned.</p>

<p>Either way, you can go with the Entity Framework to handle the call to persist/retrieve the data.</p>
