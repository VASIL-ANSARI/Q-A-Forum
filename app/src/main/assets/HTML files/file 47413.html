<p>The problem here is your test condition. Your loop repeats if you enter 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8. As soon as you enter 1, 5, or 9, the loop exits. If you enter 1, 5, or 9, then one of the diagonal values is set to <code>'X'</code>. <code>while</code> loops while the condition is true. As soon as the condition evaluates to false, it exits. When you enter 1, 5, or 9, you cause the condition to be false.</p>

<p>Imagine, for a second, that <code>table[0][0]</code> is <code>'X'</code>, <code>table[1][1]</code> is <code>'N'</code>, and <code>table[2][2]</code> is <code>'N'</code>. In other words, the board looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>X | N | N
--+---+---
N | N | N
--+---+---
N | N | N
</code></pre>

<p>Then your test condition is:</p>

<pre><code>table[0][0] != 'X' &amp;&amp; table[1][1] != 'X' &amp;&amp; table[2][2] != 'X'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
false                 true                  true
</code></pre>

<p>If you logically AND these together (as you are with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>), this evaluates to <code>false</code> (which makes sense: <code>false AND true</code> should evaluate to <code>false</code>; only <code>true AND true</code> should evaluate to <code>true</code>).</p>

<p>So what should your test condition be?</p>

<p>What you really want is to do is loop only if the user doesn't have 3 in a row. In other words, check if the user has 3 in a row; if he does not have 3 in a row, then proceed.</p>

<p>We can construct that logical statement as:</p>

<pre><code>// This checks if the user has 3 in a row
table[0][0] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[1][1] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[2][2] == 'X'

// We want to check if the user does NOT have 3 in a row,
// so we can negate the above with !
!(table[0][0] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[1][1] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[2][2] == 'X')

// With De Morgan's laws, we can simplify this to:
table[0][0] != 'X' || table[1][1] != 'X' || table[2][2] != 'X'
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, your looping condition should be one of (they're both equivalent; pick whichever one makes more sense to you):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>!(table[0][0] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[1][1] == 'X' &amp;&amp; table[2][2] == 'X')</code><br>
This checks if the user does not have 3 in a row</li>
<li><code>table[0][0] != 'X' || table[1][1] != 'X' || table[2][2] != 'X'</code><br>
This checks if the user does not have an <code>'X'</code> any one of the needed positions. It logically follows that if the user is missing an <code>'X'</code> in one of these positions, the user cannot have 3 in a row. This is just an application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws" rel="nofollow">De Morgan's laws</a> to the previous logical statement.</li>
</ul>
