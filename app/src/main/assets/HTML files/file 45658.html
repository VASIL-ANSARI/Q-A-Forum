<p>Some troubleshooting steps I would take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the redirect and just return an empty view and see if the cookie is there</li>
<li>Do not set Secure to true and see if that's the issue</li>
<li>Force a response flush to see if there's an action filter or something post action execution that's preventing the cookie from being returned in the response</li>
<li>Use fiddler to look at the actual http response for the cookie in case your browser is preventing cookies</li>
</ul>
