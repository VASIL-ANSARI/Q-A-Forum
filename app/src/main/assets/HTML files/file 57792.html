<p>Related to the static initializer fiascos referred to in numerous other posts on SO, the culprit in this case was the following pattern:</p>

<p><code>.h</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass {
    static String SOME_STATIC_STRING;
};

String SomeClass::SOME_STATIC_STRING("foo");
</code></pre>

<p>If you do elect to use an initializer like this, it should be moved to the <code>.cpp</code> file. </p>
