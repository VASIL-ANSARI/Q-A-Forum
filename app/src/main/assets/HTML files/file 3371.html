<p>You don't make use of the <em>using</em> keyword or <em>finally</em> blocks to ensure your resources are closed.  </p>

<p>If there are exceptions anywhere in your code, the cleanup may not happen.  Your multiple catch blocks <em>may</em> get all scenarios, but I can't easily tell by reading the code.</p>

<p>A generally preferred pattern for using resources that need to be cleaned up is:</p>

<pre><code>using (MyResource res = new MyResource())
{
   // Do Stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>if MyResource implements IDisposable, or</p>

<pre><code>try
{
  MyResource res = new MyResource();
  // Do Stuff
} catch (Exception ex)
{
  // Whatever needs handing on exception
}
finally
{
  res.Close(); // Or whatever call needs to be made to clean up your resource.
}
</code></pre>
