<p>I have worked out the following solution.</p>

<p>I'm not particularly happy with aspects of it (for example, having to unsubscribe ALL interest in 'process_action.action_controller'), and I'll certainly accept a better answer.</p>

<p>We add the following as <code>config/initializers/custom_ac_log_subscriber.rb</code></p>

<pre><code>module MyApp
  class CustomAcLogSubscriber &lt; ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
    INTERNAL_PARAMS = ActionController::LogSubscriber::INTERNAL_PARAMS

    #Do your custom stuff here. (The following is much simplified).
    def start_processing(event)
      payload = event.payload
      params  = payload[:params].except(*INTERNAL_PARAMS)
      info "Processing #{payload[:controller]}##{payload[:action]} (...)"
      info "  Parameters: #{params.inspect}" unless params.empty?
    end

    def process_action(event)
      payload   = event.payload
      message = "Completed in %.0fms [#{payload[:path]}]" % event.duration
      info(message)
    end

    def logger
      ActionController::Base.logger
    end
  end
end

#Prevent ActionController::LogSubscriber from also acting on these notifications
#Note that the following undesireably unregisters *everyone's*
#interest in these.  We can't target one LogSubscriber, it seems(?)
%w(process_action start_processing).each do |evt|
  ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe "#{evt}.action_controller"
end

#Register our own interest
MyApp::CustomAcLogSubscriber.attach_to :action_controller
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notes on aborted initial approach:</strong></p>

<p>I initially attempted an approach of unregistering the default LogSubscriber, with the intention that our custom one would inherit and do all the work (without having to reimpl).</p>

<p>However, there are a number of problems.</p>

<p>1) It's not enough to remove the LogSubscriber as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber.log_subscribers.delete_if{ |ls| 
  ls.instance_of? ActionController::LogSubscriber } 
</code></pre>

<p>As the request for notifications remains registered.</p>

<p>2) Further, when you inherit a LogSubscriber and register it, it appears any non-overridden methods will not be called using the inherited implementation.</p>
