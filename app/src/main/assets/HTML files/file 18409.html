<p>According to the tags of your post, I assume you want to change non-validated dates using JavaScript (with jQuery as you use the Datepicker).</p>

<p>According to the jsFiddle you linked, date_validation is displayed either as a date or as a text that does not match the regexp <code>/^[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$/</code>.</p>

<p>To test if the date was confirmed, as you use indexes a lot and using the variable <code>i</code> from inside the loop and the naming structure of your inputs:</p>

<pre><code>if(!$('input[name="data['+i+'][date_validation]"]').val().match('/^[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$/')) {
  //date not confirmed &gt; add the date element to the to-be-returned array
  items.push($('input[name="data['+i+'][date]"]')); //or use items[i]=$('#date'+(i+1)) as you did in your post
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
