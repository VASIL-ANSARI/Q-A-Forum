<p>I wouldn't recommend any schema.org specific plugins, as these only bring noise. At least that was my experience.</p>

<p>Not sure if I can help for the specific problem you have, but you can at least try using Yoast plugin <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">https://yoast.com/wordpress/</a>, which is the SEO plugin that also manages schema.org markup in general.</p>

<p>I know it is not an out-of-the-box solution, but sometimes solutions that sound simple, like this one, may help.</p>
