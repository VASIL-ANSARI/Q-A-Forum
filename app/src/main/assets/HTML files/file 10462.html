<p>You don't instantiate an interface. You create classes that <em>implement</em> the interface, instantiate those, but reference the interface (as opposed to the implementing class).</p>

<p>This allows your code to remain implementation-neutral, similar to using a <code>List</code> reference, but an <code>ArrayList</code> implementation.</p>

<p>When combined with dependency injection it makes testing and extensibility much easier, too.</p>
