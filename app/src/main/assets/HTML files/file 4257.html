<p>If you set Boolean as the attribute type in your model, that means it will be implemented using <code>NSNumber</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you'd want to return no value instead of <code>NO</code>, I'd actually recommend you don't. You'll have a much easier time with data integrity if you just set a false default value.</p>

<p>However, if you absolutely insist, you can just check if the attribute is <code>nil</code> or not to see if it was assigned a value yet.</p>
