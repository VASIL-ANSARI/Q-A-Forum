<p>Gems with extensions written in C, like bcrypt, won't always compile on different platforms/ruby versions. You could look for a pure ruby alternative to bcrypt and avoid possible issues with C extensions altogether. You could also try a different version of the gem and see if it compiles on your system.</p>
