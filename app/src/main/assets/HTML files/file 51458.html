<p>Per Section 3.6 of the C# language specification, the method signature does not include the return type (explicit) or the access modifier (by omission):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signature of a method consists of the name of the method, the number of type parameters and the type and kind (value, reference, or output) of each of its formal parameters, considered in the order left to right. For these purposes, any type parameter of the method that occurs in the type of a formal parameter is identified not by its name, but by its ordinal position in the type argument list of the method. <strong>The signature of a method specifically does not include the return type, the params modifier that may be specified for the right-most parameter, nor the optional type parameter constraints.</strong></p>
