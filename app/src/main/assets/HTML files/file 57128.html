<p>thanks for your question.</p>

<p>I never worked with Meteor, but from what I know about animations - I expect that they are defined in a css file under specific class names, is that true?</p>

<p>If so, the easiest way to "restart" an animation, if you are using <em>keyframes</em> , is to add/remove the class responsible for the animation, from the dinamically generated element.</p>

<p>I found this small code example in the Meteor documentation:</p>

<pre><code>animated.your-custom-class.zoomIn {
 -webkit-animation-duration: 500ms;
 animation-duration: 500ms;
}

animated.your-custom-class.bounceOut {
 -webkit-animation-duration: 2000ms;
 animation-duration: 2000ms;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes me think that the animations are indeed defined for specific classnames.</p>

<p>Try my suggestion and post an update if it solves your problem please :)</p>
