<p>It looks to me that the PHP makes two calls to <code>echo json_encode()</code> when it is successful. One to echo the user array and one to echo <code>true</code>. I think that results in invalid JSON.</p>

<p>I suggest you write the PHP so it makes one and ONLY one call to <code>echo json_encode()</code>. You could have it return the following for success:</p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode(array("success" =&gt; true, "user" =&gt; $user));
</code></pre>

<p>And the following for failure:</p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode(array("success" =&gt; false, "message" =&gt; 'Please, fill in all fields!'));
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the Javacript, you can have something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>success: function(result) {
    if (result.success) {
        var user = result.user;
        // Do something with user here.
    } else {
        var message = result.message;
        // Do something with message here.
    }
}
</code></pre>
