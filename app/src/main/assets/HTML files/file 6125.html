<p>This assumes that the top time is the "inclusive time", not the "exclusive time".  </p>

<p>Inclusive time means that it includes any code called by the method, in this case the <code>FirstOrDefault</code> will execute the database call. Database calls are expensive in the context of latency, but the CPU thread is blocked and not using the CPU while waiting for the database call.</p>

<p>First you should ask yourself if this is a problem, it does not significantly affect throughput (assuming the database server can handle the load), but latency of your calls.</p>

<p>If this is a problem you need to speed up the actual SQL query. You should start SQL profiler, catch the actual question, then run it in SQL management studio. Look at the execution plan to see if the query is slower than expected and try to figure out why. If it is too slow you might check your indexing to start with.</p>
