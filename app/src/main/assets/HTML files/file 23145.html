<p><code>argv</code> is passed to your program as a pointer to an array of pointers to strings.</p>

<p>If lie and you tell the compiler that it's an <code>int</code>, the bytes of the pointer will be interpreted as an <code>int</code>, and you'll get a memory address.  (on a 64-bit system, you'll probably get a crash)  </p>

<p>If you pretend that it's a <code>float</code>, the compiler will probably interpret those bytes / bits as an IEE-754-encoded floating-point value, resulting in a differently weird number.  (what exactly happens depends on the calling convention)</p>

<p>If you pretend that it's any type which is not the same width as a pointer, you will probably crash.</p>

<h2>The moral of the story is</h2>

<p>C does exactly what you tell it to.  It is up to you to tell it how to interpret things.</p>
