<p>The problem above is that you have height of wrapper at 100%, leaving "no room" on that page for the footer. It necessarily is placed after 100% of the page is used, thus forcing a scroll.</p>

<p>Instead, you can change the position of the footer to be fixed, and always be on the bottom of the page. </p>

<pre><code>footer{
    position:fixed;
    bottom:0;
}
</code></pre>
