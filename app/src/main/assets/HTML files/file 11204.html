<p>A repository should just act like an in-memory collection of data. The nomenclature you choose, whether it be Add or Insert, Delete or Remove, Select or Get, is not important. </p>

<p>You could separate your repository into 2 interfaces, and then have a ReadOnlyRepository for getting / selecting data, and a WriteRepository for adding / updating / deleting data. It doesn't matter. What matters is that your application or business code uses the repository to interact with data as if it was already loaded into memory, so you don't have to craft SQL queries intermingled with business or application code. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Since we're talking about a pattern, there is not a single "true" repository interface or implementation. There can be many different implementations that all follow a similar pattern.</p>
