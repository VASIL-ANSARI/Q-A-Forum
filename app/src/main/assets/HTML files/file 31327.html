<p><code>NSXMLParser</code> is probably not the correct tool for the job. It requires accurate XML input and often HTML from websites isn't accurate enough (missing tags / bad encoding / etc).</p>

<p>Instead, you may want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a different parser that is more free and easy about accuracy</li>
<li>Load into a web view and use javascript to find your content</li>
<li>Use <code>NSScanner</code> to locate and extract your content</li>
<li>Find a service which offers a proper API rather than trying to scrape the results</li>
</ol>
