<p>Backing a messaging server with JDBC is never going to be as fast using an optimized message store. Most of the time, a broker simply writes messages to disk but do not read. A traditional database is often more optimized towards read performance and complex queries than maximum write performance. </p>

<p><a href="http://activemq.apache.org/replicated-leveldb-store.html" rel="nofollow">ActiveMQ with replicated LevelDB</a> seems to be a decent fit for your requirements. It will automatically replicate the message store to "slave" brokers while still allow high throughput.</p>

<p>Another option would be to dig into the database part rather than the broker part. You will probably notice similar patterns with other brokers as well, if you hook them up to JDBC. Is there a way to make your database work more efficient with write performance? SSD disks? Settings? etc. As I said, by default, most databases are tweaked towards read performance and performance of complex queries.</p>
