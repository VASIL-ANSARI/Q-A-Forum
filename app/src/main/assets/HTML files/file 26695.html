<p>You may have a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html" rel="nofollow">Objective-C Runtime Reference</a>, section "Adding Classes".
Of curse this is about generating classes at runtime. </p>

<p>If you talking about Source Code generation, have a look at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/index.html" rel="nofollow">Xtext</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/" rel="nofollow">Xtend</a>. Those are very powerful tools for code generation. We use them to generate Objective-C code. There already is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nightscape/629651" rel="nofollow">grammar for JSON</a>. Of curse, there's a lot of stuff to learn.</p>
