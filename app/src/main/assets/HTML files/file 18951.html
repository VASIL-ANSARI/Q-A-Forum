<p>When a table is using an identity field it chooses it's own values.  It tracks these values to make sure that it never tries to enter a duplicate and will produce this error if you try to specify your own.</p>

<p>So, in your case either A insert the row without the field that has been marked as an identity field; letting the sql engine pick it's own value for that field. ( that's the whole reason your using an identity field right )</p>

<p>Or, B.  Enable <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188059%28v=sql.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">identity_insert</a> on before running your insert ( if you have a good reason for inserting a specific value as the key ).</p>

<p>You also need to use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174335%28v=sql.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">valid insert statement</a>.  Specify the columns you're inserting as well as the values.</p>
