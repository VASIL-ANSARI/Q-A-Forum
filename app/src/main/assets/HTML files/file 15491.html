<p>In order to get <code>InRequestScope()</code> objects to be disposed when the request is finished, you have to load the <code>OnePerRequestHttpModule</code>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't know why everyone feels the need to do things the hard way.  Just install Ninject.MVC3 from nuget and it takes care of all this for you.  99.9% of the "please help me, Ninject isn't doing what it's supposed to" questions I see are because people feel the need to do things the hard way and they do it wrong.  </p>

<p>Save yourself some headache.  Just install Ninject.MVC3 and copy over your bindings and/or modules to NinjectWebCommon.cs and you're done.</p>
