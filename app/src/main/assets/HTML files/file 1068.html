<p>Well, I don't know much about Ruby. But the obvious point about Python's "self" is that it's not a "keyword" ...it's just the name of an argument that's sent to your method.</p>

<p>You can use any name you like for this argument. "Self" is just a convention.</p>

<p>For example :</p>

<pre><code>class X :
    def __init__(a,val) :
        a.x = val
    def p(b) :
        print b.x

x = X(6)
x.p()
</code></pre>

<p>Prints the number 6 on the terminal. In the constructor the self object is actually called a. But in the p() method, it's called b.</p>

<p>Update : In October 2008, Guido pointed out that having an explicit self was also necessary to allow Python decorators to be general enough to work on pure functions, methods or classmethods : <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html" rel="nofollow">http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html</a></p>
