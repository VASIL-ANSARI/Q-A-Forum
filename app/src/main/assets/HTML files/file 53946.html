<p>This issue arises when you try to <em>create</em> a database under <code>(LocalDB)</code> in one account, then <em>access</em> the database from another account - in this case, IIS's application pool account.</p>

<p>One solution is already given <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13761518/how-to-start-an-sql-server-localdb-via-iis">here</a> - using the same account for creation and access. This should be fine for development, but is not recommended for production.</p>
