<p>Why are you storing this in Session, do you need to maintain this script in between GET requests?</p>

<p>If only postbacks are relevant you could store it in viewstate as this is maintained only when doing a postback.</p>

<p>If you want this string to be available on GET requests too you might want to introduce a different variable which has an identifier identifying the page for which the script is generated. If the requested page doesn't match the control variable you will have to generate a new script.</p>
