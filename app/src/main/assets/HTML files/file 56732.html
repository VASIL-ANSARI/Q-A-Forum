<p>It depends on how much RAM you have. You need 5 * 70MB * 8 = 2800MB. There are some cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have much more than that, it shouldn't be a problem to find it, even in contiguous blocks. I suppose you don't have so much.</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, you don't have that much memory, no container will suit your needs, and there's nothing you can really do, other than adding RAM or modifying your program to use less cores.</li>
<li>In the intermediate case, that is, your memory is not less than that, but not much more either, switching to another container might work but there are still problems: keep in mind that a vector is very space-efficient, as it is contiguous; any kind of linked list needs to store pointers to the next elements, and these pointers can take significant space, so you might end up needing more than 2800MB, although not in contiguous chunks. A <code>std::list</code>, from this point of view, would be terrible, because it needs a pointer to every element. So if your vectors hold a few, large items, switching to a list will give you a little overhead due to those few pointers, but if they are holding a lot of small values, the list will force you to waste a lot of space to store the pointers. In this sense, a deque should be what you need, as internally it is usually implemented as a group of arrays, so you don't need a pointer to every element.</li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude: yes, a deque is what you are looking for. It will require more memory than vectors, but only a little, and that memory won't have to be contiguous, so you shouldn't have any more RAM fragmentation problems.</p>
