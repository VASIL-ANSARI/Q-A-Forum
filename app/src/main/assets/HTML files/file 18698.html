<p>Use something like this to select the toggleThisDiv</p>

<pre><code>$('#&lt;%= toggleThisDiv.ClientID %&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>When the website is generated from your asp code, your IDs will be different than what you have given them.  This is because they are run at server.  Anytime that you are using runat server, use the format above to find the generated ID.</p>

<p>You should use a class inside to repeater though.</p>
