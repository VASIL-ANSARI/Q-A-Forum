<p>This had nothing to do with the <code>IsolatedStorageSettings</code>. It works fine. The problem was when you were creating the <code>Uri</code> you set the <code>UriKind</code> as <code>RelativeOrAbsolute</code>.</p>

<p>Thats what threw the Exception and InnerException states that <code>This operations is not supported for a relative URI</code>. What you need to do is change the <code>UriKind</code> to <code>Absolute</code>. So the code block should look like this.</p>

<pre><code>private void sinc(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (iso.TryGetValue&lt;string&gt;("isoServer", out retornaNome))
    {
        serv = retornaNome;
    } 
    else 
    {
        // Let the user know.
        return;
    }

    order.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;

    client = new WebClient();
    url = serv + "/json.html";
    Uri uri = new Uri(url, UriKind.Absolute); // &lt;&lt;&lt; Absolute instead of RelativeOrAbsolute
    client.OpenReadCompleted += new OpenReadCompletedEventHandler(client_OpenReadCompleted);
    client.DownloadProgressChanged += new DownloadProgressChangedEventHandler(client_DownloadProgressChanged);
    client.OpenReadAsync(uri);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should fix your problem and work just fine :)</p>
