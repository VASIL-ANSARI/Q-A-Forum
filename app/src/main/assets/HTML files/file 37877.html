<p>The error message explains your problem - don't try to create objects (especially those which require system APIs, but preferably as a design practice nothing at all) until onCreate() of your Service has been called. </p>

<pre><code>public class MyService extends Service {
    Locator locator = new Locator();
    Timer myTimer = new Timer();
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Should be</p>

<pre><code>public class MyService extends Service {
    Locator locator;
    Timer myTimer;
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        locator = new Locator();
        myTimer = new Timer();
    }
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Or possibly one of the other Service lifecycle methods more appropriate to what you are actually doing.</p>
