<p>Did you close document after adding paragraphs and such?  In iTextSharp , sample code says :</p>

<pre><code>pdfDoc.Open();

//Some content added in between

pdfDoc.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if you closed it, since it's not in your sample. Sometimes, when working with files, if you do not close them, they get corrupted and unable to open. That could be a problem. </p>
