<p>In most databases, you can use the <code>row_number()</code> function to do this:</p>

<pre><code>select comp_id, app_id, cnt
from (select t.*, row_number() over (partition by app_id order by cnt desc) as seqnum
      from (SELECT COMP_ID, APP_ID, count(*) as cnt
            FROM APP_ACCT_VIEW
            GROUP BY COMP_ID, APP_ID
           ) t
     ) t
where seqnum = 1
</code></pre>

<p>If this is not available, you have to do the calculation of seqnum some other way, such as a correlated subquery.</p>
