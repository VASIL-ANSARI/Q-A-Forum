<p>There would generally be a server language used with a website that has a login feature, most commonly PHP.</p>

<p>With PHP your server can save variables, that contain information, such as if a user is currently logged in.</p>

<p>Then you can write conditional statements that offer different output, depending on the condition. For example:</p>

<p><code>if (user_logged_in()) { echo "Hello ".$user."!"; } else { echo "Login"; }</code></p>

<p>This line basically says, if the user is logged in, then display Hello and their username. If they are not logged in, then display 'Login'.</p>

<p>That's a very simple form, but that's how it would be done, essentially all using PHP IF statements - <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php</a></p>
