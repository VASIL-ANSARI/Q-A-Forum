<p>That invokes undefined behavior. For explanation, read @James Kanze's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8414802/415784">answer</a>. </p>

<p>I would rather move to next question: if in the other topic, none of the answer have used <code>std::find_if</code>, then it is because those posts do not talk about deleting and erasing a <em>particular</em> element. They
seem to delete all the elements, or few of them have used functor where they check which objects to delete, which is also fine.</p>

<p>But the major difference between your code, and their code is that your code deletes and erases <em>at most</em> *one* object, and their code <em>could</em> delete all objects (the one which uses functor and inside the functor it deletes the object on meeting the condition).</p>

<p>Well this is what I could say for a correctly written <code>std::find_if</code>. </p>

<p>However, in reality, I couldn't understand your code, especially these two lines:</p>

<pre><code>//I formatted the code so that entire code is visible without 
//scrolling horizontally

SomeStruct someStruct(identifier); 
std::vector&lt;SomeStruct*&gt;::iterator it = std::find_if
                                   (
                                     vWrapper.begin(), 
                                     vWrapper.end(),
                                     SomeStruct::Find_SomeStruct(&amp;identifier)
                                   );
</code></pre>

<p>What is the first line doing there? You declared a variable and forgot it? Well maybe, you use it somewhere else; in that case, it is okay.</p>

<p>But what is <code>SomeStruct::Find_SomeStruct</code>? Is it a <em>nested</em> class which can act like a functor? a static function or what? Does your compile successfully?  A complete answer also depends on these questions which I posed.</p>
