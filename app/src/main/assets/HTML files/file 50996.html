<p>If you use the command line for building and running the app, the root www-folder and some other things, like icons, splashscreens, are copied to the platform folder(s). So this folder will be overridden.</p>

<p>The faster way for developing an app with cordova is to have a symlink from the root www-folder to the www-platform-folder.</p>

<p>I do the coding with PhpStorm, it has a better support for JS/CSS and HTML than Android Studio and do the platform specific things like building, running and special settings in Xcode and Android Studio.</p>
