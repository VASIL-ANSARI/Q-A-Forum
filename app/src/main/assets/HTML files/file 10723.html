<p>So, to start with, events that fire more often can be more troublesome. So a mouseover event, which fires "continuously" as the mouse moves over an element, could cause a performance impact more easily than a click event, which can only fire as fast as the user can click.</p>

<p>However, it's the code you put in your handler that will have the real performance impact.</p>

<p>If firing speed is an issue, check out the excellent jQuery throttle/debounce plugin: <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-throttle-debounce">https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-throttle-debounce</a></p>
