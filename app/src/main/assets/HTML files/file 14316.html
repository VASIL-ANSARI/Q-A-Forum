<p>I think there are several ways to achieve this. You could check for the http-referrer, and only allow access if the user comes from your first page.
This can be done with .htaccess (as it is often used to prevent image-hotlinking). Look at this example as a starting point:<br>
<a href="http://altlab.com/htaccess_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://altlab.com/htaccess_tutorial.html</a>  </p>

<p>Off course you can also check the referrer server-side, when using PHP/Python/whatever.</p>

<p>Or, as a second approach - load the proceed.html via jQuery and make sure that it only allows access if the request is done through ajax.
Also here you can check this with different techniques.<br>
See this question for more information: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466802/deny-ajax-file-access-using-htaccess">Deny ajax file access using htaccess</a></p>

<p>Apache example:</p>

<pre><code>SetEnvIfNoCase X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest ajax
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from env=ajax
</code></pre>
