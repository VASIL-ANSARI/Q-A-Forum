<p>I'm sorry I don't have a direct solution for you, but when chasing down WCF-related issues, I've found that turning on the WCF trace logs, running through the scenario, then going over the logs in SvcTraceViewer.exe helps...   you'll get some visibility into the stack which is likely where things are breaking down on you.</p>

<p>You can use the "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732009.aspx">WCF Service Configuration Editor</a>" to turn on/off the various log settings and levels.</p>
