<p>If these tables are related you can JOIN them using the foreign key.
If I'm not mistaken this pId in the table pages_admin is a foreign key to the id on the table pages, is that correct?</p>

<p>If so, you could do something like this to you query:</p>

<pre><code>"SELECT * FROM pages p
LEFT JOIN admin_pages ap on p.id = ap.pId 
WHERE (`pId`=$switch AND `rand`=$randID AND `admin`!='{$_SESSION['user']}')"
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I've changed the syntax, instead of merging string you can use only one containing all variables you need.</p>
