<p>You can do this by using a custom DB expression and concatenate lastname + id. This because the Form helper only likes 1 column for the text (option text) and 1 column for the id (option value attribute).</p>

<pre><code>$users = User::select(DB::raw('CONCAT(lastname, id) AS userselect, id'))-&gt;lists('userselect', 'id');
</code></pre>

<p>I find this the way to go, except you have to keep in mind that CONCAT can behave differently on different DBMS's or this function could not even exist. If you do care about this, I would just loop through your users list and manually concatenate with standard PHP script.</p>

<p>Another option is to just adjust the Form helper to support your needs. Though I would not recommend doing this if you want to keep your code rapidly upgradable.</p>
