<p>Pointer addition/subtraction does not move by only one byte - it moves by the size of the type of the object being pointed to. </p>

<p>That is to say (assuming 4-byte integers), </p>

<pre><code>int *p = 0x00004
int *q = p+1;
assert(q == 0x00008)
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it's the same as if you used the index of operator:</p>

<pre><code>int *q = &amp;p[1]
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to increment a pointer by one, cast it to a <code>unsigned char *</code>. The way you did it, you were overwriting memory that was not part of the variable <code>a</code> and possibly overwriting existing data for something else.</p>
