<p>I resolved my problem, although I'm not quite sure how I did. I made some changes to the mark up (I'm not sure which of these solved the problem):</p>

<ul>
<li>no longer using the bootstrap grid, now no position style is applied to the parent div</li>
<li>added <code>overflow: hidden;</code> to the parent div</li>
<li>removed a clearfix out of the affected divs</li>
<li>floating the sidebar (even I don't think this is relevant)</li>
</ul>

<p>...in the hope this will probably help somebody.</p>
