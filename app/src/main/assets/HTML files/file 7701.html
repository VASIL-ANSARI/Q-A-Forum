<p>Well, I did some more research and it appears that a 307 is automatically handled by the browser, and is not able to be intercepted by jquery.</p>

<p>I ended up using a different statusCode to do the redirect (<code>410 Gone</code>).</p>

<p>This probably isn't the best solution, but I don't have access to the apache server code.</p>
