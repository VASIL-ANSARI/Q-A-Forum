<p>the webserver process runs most likely not under the same user as you when you "execute from command line", it will probably not have the same shell environment either.
you can however explicitly configure a proxy server in your curl request. if i recall that correctly its the -x switch. you can also pass a lot of arguments. just see the manpage.
wget supports proxy as well but as far as i am nut sure about the params you configure. see the manpage as well.</p>
