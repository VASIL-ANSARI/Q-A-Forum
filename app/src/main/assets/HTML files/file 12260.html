<p><code>yield self</code> passes <code>self</code> to the block <code>tap</code> is called with, whereas the <code>self</code> at the end is what <code>tap</code> returns. That's exactly the point of <code>tap</code>, using the object in a block and still being able to pass it on to the next method in the chain. Note however that if the block method is destructive, you'll pass on the modified version. Personally I try to avoid that, since I mostly use <code>tap</code> for debugging purposes. </p>
