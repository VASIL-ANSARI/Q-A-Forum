<p>The error you are getting is because <code>@EnableBatchProcessing</code> registers a <code>StepScope</code> and so does Spring Batch Admin.  As I mentioned in the post you referenced, I would not recommend using <code>@EnableBatchProcessing</code> with Spring Batch Admin and instead, just configure the beans you need (only the job factory and step factory). </p>
