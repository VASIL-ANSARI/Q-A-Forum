<p>If you want to deal with unchecked exceptions, you could implement SubscriberExceptionHandler's method like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void handleException(Throwable exception, SubscriberExceptionContext context) {
    // Check if the exception if of some type you wish to be rethrown, and rethrow it.
    // Here I'll assume you'd like to rethrow RuntimeExceptions instead of 'consuming' them.
    if (exception instanceof RuntimeException) {
        throw (RuntimeException) exception;
    }

    // If the exception is OK to be handled here, do some stuff with it, e.g. log it.
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>After creating a class implementing the SubscriberExceptionHandler interface, you can pass its instance to the EventBus's constructor:</p>

<pre><code>EventBus eventBus = new EventBus(new MySubscriberExceptionHandler());
</code></pre>

<p>And done, <code>eventBus</code> will use your exception handler which will let <code>RuntimeExceptions</code> bubble up.</p>
