<p>Unless you've got a specific justification for wanting to store your compiled code in version control, I wouldn't bother trying to add <code>.class</code> files. Eclipse <em>may</em> allow you to add them somehow, but if it does it probably intentionally makes it difficult. There's no reason why you couldn't add them manually from a command line, though.</p>

<p>Instead, I would ensure that your build scripts (ant, maven or whatever) are checked into the repository, and build your class files in a deterministic and repeatable way. Ensure the version of the compiler is specified, for example, so that the current version of your compiler becomes a requirement for repeating the build using this source code at this moment in time.</p>
