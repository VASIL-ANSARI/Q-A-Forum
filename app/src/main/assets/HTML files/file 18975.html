<p>I am not sure about your code, its too tedious to go through. But i have had the same problems before and I solved it as follows. In your adapter you need to set the on click listener for that button and add a tag to it.</p>

<pre><code>holder.btnList.setOnClickListener(((MyActivity) context));
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>context</code> is the Context that you pass to the adapter and the <code>MyActivity</code> is whatever activity in which the click is to be handled. So when you click the button then the <code>MyActivity</code>'s on click listener will be called. You can also add tags to the holder object if you want any data to be passed. Then in your <code>MyActivity</code> where you implement the <code>onClickListener</code>. You handle whatever events you want in the <code>MyActivity</code>. Please post further doubts if you have any.</p>
