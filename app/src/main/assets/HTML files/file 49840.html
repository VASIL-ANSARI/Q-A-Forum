<p>If you're getting SIGSEGV, it means you're trying to access memory in a segment your program does not have access to, or you're trying to access memory your program has access to in an invalid way.</p>

<p>Your first course of action should be to use Valgrind or Dr. Memory, when you have a memory segmentation error like this.</p>

<p>Based on your code, I'd assume you may be having a problem when n > 10 that is causing a buffer overrun in b and x. If you named your parameters to something meaningful, it would be easier for us to solve.</p>
