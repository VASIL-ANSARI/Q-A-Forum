<p>You could use the <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/css3attributeselectors" rel="nofollow">attribute starts with selector</a>:</p>

<pre><code>form#fiche-node-form.node-form input[id^="edit-field-address-und"].form-text {
    width: 493px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming that you don't have any other elements that also have an ID starting with <code>edit-field-address-und</code>.</p>
