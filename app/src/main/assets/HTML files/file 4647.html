<p>I describe a brute force tactic here, only use it if all else fails...</p>

<p>Get the length of the bar you want to color, 
multiply the length by the fraction of the number the user picked,
result is the number of pixels that you should make the colored section of the bar.</p>

<p>so, your bar is 324 pixels,
the user picked '42', 324 * .42
the length of the colored part of your bar is 136.08 pixels</p>
