<p>This question has no connection to PHP. It's related to DNS and systems administration.</p>

<p>In very short, there are three steps:</p>

<p>1) Configure DNS so that {subdomain}.domain points to your application. Two approaches - either add a new DNS entry every time a new user signs up, or add a wildcard '*' entry just once so anything before .domain points to the same IP address.</p>

<p>2) Ensure your web server software will accept request for {subdomain}.domain and pass it to your application. Easiest thing - a default virtual host (if no other website matches, send the request to your application so all subdomains will be covered automatically)</p>

<p>3) Do the routing in your PHP application. Check current request address (it's in <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php" rel="nofollow">$_SERVER global variable)</a>, see if this subdomain (user) actually exists and then display the website accordingly.</p>
