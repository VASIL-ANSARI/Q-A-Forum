<p>Actually, the more I think about this the more I get the feeling that my previous answer was wrong. So I'm revising my statement:</p>

<p>This is most likely an issue with the lack of ajax <code>contentTypes</code>. Removing the stringify forces the model binder to see it as a <code>key/value</code> pair, and work as expected. Stringifying it, without setting the correct contentType, will treat the entire object as a key (with no value).</p>

<p>I did the below tests (going full out here).</p>

<p>How you sent it (stingifying without contentType):</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
     async: false,
     type: 'POST',
     data: JSON.stringify(contactViewModel),
     url: "/echo/json/",
     success: function (result) {
         console.log(result);
     }                           
});
</code></pre>

<p>When inspecting what was actually sent:</p>

<p>How I first suggested (not stingifying, i.e. sending as key/value pair):</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
     async: false,
     type: 'POST',
     data: contactViewModel,
     url: "/echo/json/",
     success: function (result) {
              console.log(result);
     }                           
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works, and MVC can bind it properly. When inspecting what was actually sent:</p>

<p>And finally, how it probably should have been sent (stringifyed with contentType):</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
     async: false,
     type: 'POST',
     data: JSON.stringify(contactViewModel),
     url: "/echo/json/",
     dataType: 'json',
     contentType: 'application/json',
     success: function (result) {
              console.log(result);
     }                           
});
</code></pre>

<p>So, using contentType together with stringify is very important. There is also a possibility that your nullable int's will cause issues (it has been known to cause problems in model binding), but I'm sure you'll be able to sort that out.</p>
