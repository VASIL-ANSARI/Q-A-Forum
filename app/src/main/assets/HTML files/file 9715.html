<p>See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow">MVC pattern</a> for web applications. You don't need to resort to XML/plain text to separate presentation from logic. Using a PHP framework such as <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org" rel="nofollow">Symfony</a> or <a href="http://www.cakephp.org" rel="nofollow">Cake</a> may help.</p>

<p>It may be best to develop a web application using HTML first and then sprinkle some AJAX on top so your application has a fallback if AJAX fails - e.g. mobile devices.</p>

<p>Hope that helps</p>
