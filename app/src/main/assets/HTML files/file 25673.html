<p>You're always showing both of the divs via class (<code>.desc</code>), and hiding the second. You're never hiding the first - even after two clicks it'll remain visible as you're using <code>show()</code>.</p>

<p>Replace <code>$("div.desc").show();</code></p>

<p>with <code>$("div.desc").toggle();</code></p>

<p>This will toggle the <code>show()</code> state, first click it'll show, second it'll hide etc.</p>
