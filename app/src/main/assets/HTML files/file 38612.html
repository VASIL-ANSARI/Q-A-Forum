<p>You need to include the openssl headers in <code>read_and_send.c</code></p>

<p>You should read a basic tutorial on C programming and how to use headers and how to compile and link.</p>

  <p>I have no clue how to fix it as for using the math library I would write:</p>
  
  <p><code>gcc -lm -c read_and_send.c</code></p>
  
  <p>wouldn't I?</p>

<p>No, the <code>-c</code> option means you only want to compile the source into a <code>.o</code> file, not link, so libraries are not used, and any <code>-l</code> options will be ignored.</p>

<p>You need to use the <code>-l</code> options when you link all the <code>.o</code> files together to create an executable. When you do that linking step, the libraries should be at the <em>end</em> of the command, after the files that depend on them.</p>
