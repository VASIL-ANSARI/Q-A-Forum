<p>So based on your comments, you need your data in the standard format of </p>

<pre><code>data: [[date,value],[date,value]...]
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a very different thing from splitting the data into two arrays. :)</p>

<p>Take this:</p>

<pre><code>$data[] = $row['value'];
$data2[] = $row['date'];
</code></pre>

<p>And change it to this:</p>

<pre><code>$data[] = array($row['date'],$row['value']);
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that your dates will need to be in epoch format, as milliseconds, and you will need to json_encode the array.</p>

<p>You'll also need to make sure your values are numeric, by casting them to either integers or floats, depending on which they are expected to be.</p>

<p>You can get the date and value in the right format like this:</p>

<pre><code>$data[] = array(
   strtotime($row['date']) * 1000, //convert to epoch time, multiply for milliseconds
   (float)$row['value']  //cast value as a float; use (int) to cast as integer
);
</code></pre>

<p>When you add the data to the chart, try it this way:</p>

<pre><code>series:[{
  data: &lt;?echo json_encode($data); ?&gt;
}]
</code></pre>

<p>(note that I do not include the brackets - the json_encode() does that already)</p>
