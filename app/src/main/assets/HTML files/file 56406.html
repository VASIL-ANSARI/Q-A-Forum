<p>To answer my own question, I think it should be OK to make a one-off request and store the Base Uri, as mentioned in their <a href="https://www.docusign.co.uk/sites/default/files/rest-api-guide-v2-2.pdf" rel="nofollow">REST API Guide</a>:</p>

<p>"Note: After using login_information to get the baseUrl, the base Url and apiPassword can be stored by the client. The login_information call is not needed in subsequent sessions, unless another call fails and the user needs to re-authenticate. Each call performs authentication":</p>
