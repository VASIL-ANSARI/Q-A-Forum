<p>The preferred workflow is to let the shell doing the redirection so you don't have to change the program code all the time.</p>

<p>But your IDE (sublime text) doesn't allow you to specify such arguments, so it limits your options.</p>

<p>Solutions/workarounds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the program from a shell. Which means you need to switch between the terminal window and sublime all the time.</li>
<li>Write a second program which runs the first and which sets up the input redirection. This way, you just need to switch tabs in sublime.</li>
<li>Instead of reading from <code>stdin</code> directly, use the <code>fileinput</code> module. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1450393/how-do-you-read-from-stdin-in-python">How do you read from stdin in Python?</a> This will allow you to write proper unit tests for your code. You can then use the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Python%20Unittest%20Helper" rel="nofollow">Python Unittest Helper</a> plugin for Sublime.</li>
</ol>
