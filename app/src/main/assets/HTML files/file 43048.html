<p>The reason you got the error: 
<em>The method add(Node) in the type Collection> is not applicable for the arguments (int)" error</em>
Is because you are passing an integer into a method that requires an object of type Node.</p>

<p>Does you tree have letters as names for the nodes and numbers as values? That is what it looks like to me. Assuming this is the case what you can do is have a class Node. The class has an attribute <em>int value</em> , <em>Node left</em> , <em>Node right</em> . If it doesnt have a left/right node then those attributes will be null. </p>

<p>So when you add the number 5 to a node, what you do is add a node which has a value of 5.
Does this make sense?</p>
