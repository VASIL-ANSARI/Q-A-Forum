<p>You cannot use a static class as a type argument. Therefore in your circumstance you cannot have:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Connection&gt; { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9092949/how-to-create-static-class-list-property-inside-static-class">this</a> answer by Jon Skeet for more information.</p>

<p>I suggest looking into the SOLID principles of object oriented programming and trying to abstract the functionality of the "connection" class out into multiples. If you provide more information on what you're trying to do I'll gladly make suggestions.</p>
