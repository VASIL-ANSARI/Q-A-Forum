<p>On your page with the ReportViewer.. click on the ReportViewer then check your properties. There are a few properties you can mess with. There should be a ShowParameterPrompt and a few other options you may be able to set to true, or set to false. I would try to turn the ShowParameterPrompt to false and see if that fixes your issue. Hope this helps!</p>
