<p>Once upon a time there was an experimental API chrome.experimental.clipboard, but there is no more <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.clipboard.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.clipboard.html</a></p>

<p>Maybe you should try: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400212/how-to-copy-to-clipboard-in-javascript">How to Copy to Clipboard in JavaScript?</a></p>

<p>UPDATE:
I was wrong - there is a possibility. As <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#permissions" rel="nofollow">permissions page</a> says there are "clipboardRead" and "clipboardWrite" permissions. So maybe they will work for you.</p>
