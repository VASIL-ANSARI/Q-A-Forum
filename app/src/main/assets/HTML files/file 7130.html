<p>You need to implement the <code>NSCoding</code> protocol on your <code>Tweet</code> class. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/UserDefaults/UserDefaults.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000059i" rel="nofollow">From the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NSUserDefaults class only supports
  the storage of objects that can be
  serialized to property lists. This
  limitation would seem to exclude many
  kinds of objects, such as NSColor and
  NSFont objects, from the user default
  system. But if objects conform to the
  NSCoding protocol they can be archived
  to NSData objects, which are property
  listâcompatible objects.</p>
