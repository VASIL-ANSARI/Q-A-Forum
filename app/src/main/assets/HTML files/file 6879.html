<p>You'll need to write some code. </p>

<p>The usually way of doing this is to put the logic into a transitional attribute in your entity. Then code a custom getter for the transitional attribute such that the value of the attribute can change as other data changes. </p>

<p>In this case, <code>cost</code> would be your transitional attribute and it would be calculated based on the value of persisted attributes <code>number</code> and <code>buy</code>. </p>

<p>With binding, any user changes to <code>number</code> and <code>buy</code> will automatically be reflected in the display value of cost. </p>
