<p>You can use the code in this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3118234/how-to-get-memory-usage-and-cpu-usage-in-android">How to get Memory usage and CPU usage in android?</a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments, you can skip the first line to get per-core data.</p>

<p>Per comment below, you can read each line of the file and print the usages, and then split the lines as in the provided link:</p>

<pre><code>public void printCpuUsages()
{
    try
    {
        RandomAccessFile reader = new RandomAccessFile("/proc/stat", "r");
        String load = reader.readLine();
        while (load != null)
        {
            Log.d("CPU", "CPU usage: " + load);
            load = reader.readLine();
        }
    }
    catch (IOException ex)
    {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>
