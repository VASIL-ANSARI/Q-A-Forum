<p>Without giving the explicit imlementational details, this can be done as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You could use a user-defined stack to explicitly store cities which are currently visited. When the target city is reached, the stack contains the path to the city.</p></li>
<li><p>Your implementation does not use a separate type to represent the nodes. There is nothing wrong with that. However, if it would use a separate type, the type could be endowed with a parent reference to another node. If an edge is followed by the algorithm, the parent reference of the visited node would be set to the node from which the visit is initiated. In that way, on reaching the target node, the desired path could be generated by following these references.</p></li>
<li><p>As the implementation lacks the separate type for nodes, an auxiliary dictionary (which uses the city names as both keys and values, where the value is the parent city). On reaching the destination node, the desired path could be generated by iteratively following to the parent in the dictionary. This approach would use the same idea as in point 2 without the introduction of a new type for the nodes.</p></li>
