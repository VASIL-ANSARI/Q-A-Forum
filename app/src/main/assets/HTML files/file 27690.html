<p>You can just filter the rows from first list as it contains both Id and Name where id is in second list and create a new list or assign it to List2. </p>

<pre><code>List2 = List1.Where( x =&gt; List2.Contains(x.Id)).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also do a join  from list1 and list2 and then select name and description. Compare in terms of performance and choose any method that you like.</p>
