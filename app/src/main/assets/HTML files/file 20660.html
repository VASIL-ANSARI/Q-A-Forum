<p>I haven't used python(x,y), but I would assume you can build a project from source. This is probably the best course of action right now. We are putting a lot of efforts into Enaml which has the disadvantage of making it rapidly changing. It is not surprising that the version 0.2 doesn't run some of the examples from pygotham.</p>

<p>FYI, EPDFree now allows to update packages including Enaml. But considering the number of commits to Enaml everyweek, I would still recommend building from source even with EPD for another few months just to get all the cool features going in.</p>

<p>See we are delivering on our promise to monitor SO :). </p>
