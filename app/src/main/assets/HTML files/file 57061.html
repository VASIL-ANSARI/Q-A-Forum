<p>You will have to enter the IP address of your local machine and the domain name as you have in your hosts file into any machine that wants to access your local wamp server.</p>

<p><code>192.168.1.11            demo.it</code></p>

<p>Of course, first the other machines must be able to reach 192.168.1.11, but as you said, they can access your site from <a href="http://192.168.1.11/site" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.11/site</a> so that must mean they can reach you.</p>

<p>Just check via ping to be double sure. Open Command prompt and check output of </p>

<p><code>ping 192.168.1.11</code></p>

<p>If you can, there might be a way to configure your router or switch such that specific domain requests are routed to your IP address, but I don't know how to do it.</p>
