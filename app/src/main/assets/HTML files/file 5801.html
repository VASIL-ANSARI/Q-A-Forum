<p>It is going to depend on your character encoding. If you use ASCII encoding, it's going to be str.length bytes. If you use UTF-16, it's going to be (str.length * 2) bytes. If you use UTF-8, it is going to depend on the characters in the string. (Some characters will only take 1 byte, but others could take up to 4 bytes.) If you're dealing with Base64-encoded data, the characters are all within the ASCII range and therefore would occupy str.length bytes on disk. If you decode them first and save as binary, it would take (str.length * 3/4) bytes. (With Base64, 3 uncoded bytes become 4 coded bytes.)</p>

<p>BTW - If you haven't read Joel Spolsky's <em>The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</em>, you should do so immediately.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If you're using localStorage, I assume that you're familiar with window.localStorage.length, though this only tells you how much has been used, not whether your new data will fit. I would also highly recommend reading <em>Dive into HTML5</em>, especially the section on storage:</p>

<p>Unless something has changed since its writing, I'm not sure what you can do as localStorage limits you to 5MB per domain with no way for the user to increase it.</p>
