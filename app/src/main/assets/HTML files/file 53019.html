<p>Angular $http has a built in cache, which you could make use of here. You can cache all $http requests, which is probably a bad idea, or specific ones. </p>

<p>On a very simple level, this should work for you</p>

<pre><code>quizService.getData = function() {
  return $http.get('quiz.json', {cache: true}).then(quizData =&gt; {
    return quizData;
  });
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can find out more in the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http" rel="nofollow">Angular docs for $http</a></p>
