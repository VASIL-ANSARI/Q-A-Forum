<p>I suppose you run that in one of the callbacks from the system to your app like e.g. a on-click-handler.
Android accumulates all the changes you make and applies them after this callback returns.</p>

<p>What you can do is to write an AsyncTask that in its onPublishProgess method does the color change and then have doInBackground loop and wait and publish the progress.</p>
