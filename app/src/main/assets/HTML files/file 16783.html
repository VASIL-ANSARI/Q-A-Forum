<p>At the moment AppJS ( <a href="http://appjs.org" rel="nofollow">http://appjs.org</a> ) seems to be the most robust contender designed exactly around these same principles. </p>

<p>Another alternative might be a GTK-webkit based solution ( <a href="http://webkitgtk.org" rel="nofollow">http://webkitgtk.org</a> ) . </p>

<p>[Update:Aug 2013]</p>

<p>Multiple other alternatives are available as well : </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.tidesdk.org" rel="nofollow"><strong>TideSDK</strong></a></p>

<p>TideSDK is community based offshoot of the immensely popular <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-sdk" rel="nofollow">Titanium SDK</a>. While the project is very promising, last I checked there were major hiccups running the developer tools on linux. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit" rel="nofollow"><strong>Node-webkit</strong></a></p>

<p>This interesting project provides seamless interoperability between Node.js and Webkit. The end result is that you can start developing an application just like you would write a web-page with the additional ability to call any built-in or third-party node-modules. CommonJS modules <em>just work</em> in the browser context. The project is intel sponsored and I have personally found it very simple to use and productive.</p></li>
