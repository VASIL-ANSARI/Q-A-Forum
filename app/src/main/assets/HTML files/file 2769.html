<p>You can try to find a C midi sequencer (such as <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/group___sequencer.html" rel="nofollow">MIDI Sequencer</a>). Also look into building .au formatted audio files (i.e. look at the specs for .au headers and sound data format). You won't be able to use .wav format because it requires a length in the header to be filled in before playback.</p>
