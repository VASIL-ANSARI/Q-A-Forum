<p>I think you are mixing concepts here- DI doesn't inherently have anything to do whether you use interfaces or concrete classes per se. You could (for example) inject a concrete class that was one of several subclasses of Pasta (<code>Linguini</code>, <code>Ravioli</code>, etc)., and the benefits of DI (low coupling, discrete testability) still apply.  </p>

<p>Most people use interfaces because that further lowers the coupling to the specific interface you need, without implying any implementation (for example, maybe it doesn't make sense to have <code>GlutenFreeElbowNoodles</code> inherit from <code>Pasta</code>) but that isn't really an IoC concern.</p>
