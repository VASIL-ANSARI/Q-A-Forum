<p>Looking at the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_now" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, it sounds like you want</p>

<pre><code>NOW(3)
</code></pre>

<p>... where the value 3 is used to specify that you want 3 digits of subsecond precision, i.e. milliseconds. (Unfortunately none of the examples in the docs show that being used, so it's relatively tricky for me to check this...)</p>

<p>To get that as a "milliseconds since the Unix epoch" value, you'd probably want to use:</p>

<pre><code>UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW(3)) * 1000
</code></pre>
