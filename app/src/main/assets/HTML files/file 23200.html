<p>I don't think this is possible using PHP - the email client you use on your iCloud account sets the new "Reply-To". However, try to add the hosting email account to your iCloud email client -(Using POP3 or IMAP)- then you will be able to "Send as" your hosting account and you won't need to forward everything to iCloud. </p>
