<p>You don't really need JavaScript for this. CSS has the <code>transform</code> property to apply affine transforms to elements. Just do something like <code>li:hover { transform: scale(1.2); }</code>. </p>

<p>It works in all recent version of Safari and Firefox, and IE 9 and newer â and if you're open to JavaScript solutions, <a href="http://www.transformie.com/" rel="nofollow">Transformie</a> adds support for 6+. </p>

<p>I made a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/paintitpurple/yfshb/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle to illustrate</a> (includes all the browser prefix versions, but I didn't actually test it in all the browsers, so I might have bungled something somewhere).</p>
