<p>The thing is that you are inheriting from 2 classes Feet and Meters. Both classes have the same methods. In your <code>Distance.__init__()</code> method, you are overriding Feet's methods with Meters' methods when doing this:</p>

<pre><code>  Feet.__init__(self)
  Meters.__init__(self)
</code></pre>

<p>What I would have done differently:</p>

<pre><code>class Distance(object):
    def __init__(self, meters=None, feet=None):
        self.feet = feet
        self.meters = meters
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>distance = Distance(meters=Meters(12))
print distance.meters.value
print distance.meters.type
# Here do whatever you want with them
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass in the two objects at the same time. And do some other stuff with
the two objects if the are both different than None.</p>
