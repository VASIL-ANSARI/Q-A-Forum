<p>This is because you install tessaract after building OpenCV, you should be sure that OpenCV find Tessaract when trying to generate the project files using CMake.</p>

<h2>1- Install first Tessaract:</h2>

<h2>2- When trying to generate the visual studio using CMake, you should be sure that CMake find Tessaract:</h2>

<p>In fact, if it didn't find it the flag <code>HAVE_TESSERACT</code> will not be defined, and as a result the library opencv_text300.dll will generate this message <code>OCRTesseract(33): Tesseract not found.</code> always you try to access to Tessarct engine. You can see the behaviour here:

<h2>3- Generate the correct opencv_text300.dll built with <code>HAVE_TESSERACT</code>.</h2>

<h2>4- Execute your executable so that the program run correctly.</h2>
