<p>If your parent element has name="books" as an attribute, and is a select element, then you can do this using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>var bookName = $('select[name="books"] option:selected').text();
</code></pre>

<p>If your parent element has an id="books" as an attribute, and is a select element, then you can do this using plain JavaScript (can probably be improved upon):</p>

<pre><code>var books = document.getElementById('books');
var bookName = books.options[books.selectedIndex].text;
</code></pre>
