<p>I will try but it is a shot in the dark. I think that you need to try to remove the buttons and plug the Arduino ports instead. Buttons usually are making a short circuit, so you can connect an output of one of the Arduino ports, and set it high. when you want a click set it to low for few milis, and then high again. Good luck!</p>
