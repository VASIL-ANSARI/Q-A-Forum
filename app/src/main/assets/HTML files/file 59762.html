<pre><code>select table.* from table join 
(select Name, max(Points) mp from table where Country='USA' group by Name
order by mp desc limit 4) t
on table.Name = t.Name and table.Points = t.mp and table.Country='USA'
order by table.points desc
</code></pre>

<p>When a person's max point row have two record, eg bob's b.jpg is also 100, this would lead to multi rows in bobs result.</p>
