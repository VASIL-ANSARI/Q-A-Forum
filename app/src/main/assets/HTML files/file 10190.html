<p>To keep the arrow style button, I usually do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = myCustomUIButton;
</code></pre>

<p>instead of setting leftBarButtonItem.</p>

<p>However this must be done in the viewDidLoad: method of the view controller that pushes the view controller where you want the button to appear. So you're setting the back button before the next view controller is pushed...</p>

<p>You could also get notified of the back button being pressed by adding some behavior in the view controller's viewWillDisappear: method.</p>
