<p>Found the solution (at least worked for me), it's the same bug that causes you not to be able to create new outlets. You must delete the [DerivedData] folder:</p>

<ol>
<li>Close the project you are working on with.</li>
<li>Delete the<code>ãDerivedDataã</code>folder of you project. (This folder may inside your project's folder, or inside
~/Library/Developer/XCode/DerivedData/(your project)/ ) or somewhere
else that were setup by you.</li>
<li>Restart Xcode.</li>
</ol>

<p>see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16182672/400112">here</a>. </p>
