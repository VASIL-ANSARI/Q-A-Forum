<p>Your program returns a pointer. It's not an "array" as you put it in the question. Because the name of an array evaluates to the address of its first item (which is the same as address of the array itself).</p>

<p>In C, the value returned from the <code>main</code> function is interpreted as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#C_language" rel="nofollow">exit status</a>, i.e. the <code>$?</code> variable used in your example.</p>

<p>I guess, you're running Bash shell, since in Bash the exit status is stored in the <code>$?</code> variable. A pointer is usually a big number, at least bigger than <strong>255</strong>, which is a maximum <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html#AEN23629" rel="nofollow">exit code in Bash</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of range exit values can result in unexpected exit codes. An exit
  value greater than 255 returns an exit code modulo 256. For example,
  exit 3809 gives an exit code of 225 (3809 % 256 = 225).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's modify your program by printing the address of the variable, and the address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo" rel="nofollow">modulo</a> <strong>256</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    static int x[3];
    printf("%ld ==&gt; %d\n", (size_t)x, (size_t)x % 256);
    return (int)x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's compile it and test if I'm right:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -Wall -g test.c -o test &amp;&amp; ./test; echo $?
test.c: In function âmainâ:
test.c:6:12: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
     return (int)x;
            ^
6295620 ==&gt; 68
68
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, the return status is equal to <code>6295620 % 256</code>, as it is documented in the <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a>.</p>
