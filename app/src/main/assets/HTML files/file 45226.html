<p>The installation process is adding include files in <code>/usr/local/include</code> (more precisely in <code>/usr/local/include/igraph</code> only) and library files in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>. Stick <code>/usr/local/include</code> to your include path in Eclipse, add <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to your library path in Eclipse, and add <code>igraph</code> to the list of linked libraries, and you are good to go. Make sure to use <code>#include &lt;igraph/whatever.h&gt;</code> in your C++ code to include igraph-specific stuff.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/ntamas/igraphpp" rel="nofollow">this project</a> tries to provide a more C++-like API for igraph. It is still experimental, the API changes all the time and many igraph functions are not wrapped in C++ equivalents yet, but it's a starting point that you can extend.</p>
