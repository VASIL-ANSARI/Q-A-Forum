<p>I would write an accessor method for each child class that returns the typecast object. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (WhiteCard *)myTypeCurrentCard {
    return (WhiteCard *)self.currentCard;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parent class would have something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (GenericCard *)myTypeCurrentCard {
    return (GenericCard *)self.currentCard;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Within each controller class with these methods, the message <code>[self myTypeCurrentCard]</code> would return a object cast to the current type. This method does not guarantee the resulting object is actually that type of object, so care must be taken to insure no runtime errors occur by sending non <code>WhiteCard</code> objects white card specific messages.</p>
