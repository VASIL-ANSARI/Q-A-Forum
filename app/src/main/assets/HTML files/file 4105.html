<p>You could use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-change-key-case.php"><code>array_change_key_case()</code></a> to create a copy of <code>$_GET</code> with either all uppercase or all lowercase keys.</p>

<pre><code>$_GET_lower = array_change_key_case($_GET, CASE_LOWER);
$orderby = isset($_GET_lower['orderby']) ? $_GET_lower['orderby'] : 'asc';
echo $orderby;
</code></pre>

<p>(I say "create a copy" simply because I don't like polluting the original superglobals, but it's your choice to overwrite them if you wish.)</p>

<p>For that matter, it'd still be better if you just stick to case-sensitive matching since it might be easier on both search engine and human eyes, as well as easier on your code... <strong>EDIT:</strong> OK, based on your comment I can see why you'd want to do something like this.</p>
