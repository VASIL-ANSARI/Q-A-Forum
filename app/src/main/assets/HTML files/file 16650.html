<p>You don't need to do anything different app, iOS will handle the binding if required.</p>

<p>Bounded connections are in a way "paired" to the iOS device. Once bounded they will not communicate to any other device. Bounding is controlled by the operating system (iOS). When a device that requires a bounded connection communicates with a iOS device, the iOS device will present a alert view asking if you wish to connect to the device.</p>

<p>Unbounded devices are continually broadcast their services and allows any iOS device to connect to it. The device will not bind to the specific iOS device and is free to connect to another iOS device at another time. This is the normal/recommended method for most BT4.0 sensors.</p>

<p>For both cases the application would normally store the UUID so it can establish the connection to the same device next time. </p>

<p>NOTE: Although unbounded devices are not "paired" with the iOS device, they will only communicate with a single iOS device at any one time.</p>
