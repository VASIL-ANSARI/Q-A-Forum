<p>You are trying to overload operators/functions by return type.  This is not allowed by the C++ standard: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>13.1/2:</strong> Certain function declarations cannot be overloaded: â Function declarations that differ only in the return type cannot be
  overloaded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Possible workarounds:</em></strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>You could consider using a function instead on an operator, passing by reference a variable for storing the return value.  In this case the overload would be possible.  But it's less handy than the assignment operator, and I guess that's no what you were looking for.  </li>
<li>A better approach would be to add a separate conversion operator between <code>cTest&lt;uint16_t,U&gt;</code> and <code>cTest&lt;uint8_t,U&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
