<p>There doesn't seem to be, however you can reinitialize it yourself. Seeing as you provided no code, I'm going to reference the code on the documents <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>To initialize you create "var player;" which is the variable in which you create an instance with the function "onYouTubeIframeAPIReady()". Perhaps you're not recreating the iframe every time you create the modal.</p>

<p>Its possible that the way you're doing modal boxes is by storing the content in a string in javascript. So everytime you close it the div element is gone therefore the youtube API might bug out because of the absents of the element you initialized it to.</p>

<p>My guess is that the iframes should be created and removed(the "player" object that is) every time you open or close the modal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot be certain, I have no code snippets to base that off of. As you provided little information.</p>

<p>So what I would to is something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>

      var isReady=0;
      var player;
      function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {
        isReady=1;
      }

      // 4. The API will call this function when the video player is ready.
      function onPlayerReady(event) {
        event.target.playVideo();
      }

      // 5. The API calls this function when the player's state changes.
      //    The function indicates that when playing a video (state=1),
      //    the player should play for six seconds and then stop.
      var done = false;
      function onPlayerStateChange(event) {
        if (event.data == YT.PlayerState.PLAYING && !done) {
          setTimeout(stopVideo, 6000);
          done = true;
        }
      }
      function stopVideo() {
        player.stopVideo();
      }
      function onModalOpen(){
        if(isReady==1){
          player = new YT.Player('player', {
            height: '390',
            width: '640',
            videoId: 'u1zgFlCw8Aw',
            events: {
              'onReady': onPlayerReady,
              'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange
            }
          });
        }
      }
      function onModalClose(){
        player=null;
      }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Of course you'll need to create a "player" object for each iframe. You'll also need to call onModalOpen/Close for each player object, which you could pass as an argument to the event handler.</p>
