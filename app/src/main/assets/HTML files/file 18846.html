<p>You are using <strong>deprecated</strong> methods/symbols.</p>

<p>Deprecation means the methods/symbols are still here, and will usually still work, but they may be removed on future iOS versions.</p>

<p>The official documentation always list the deprecated methods/symbols, and usually provides the new ones.</p>

<p>So I hate to say this, as an answer, but just <strong>read the doc</strong>.</p>

<p>Warnings about iOS 6 are not too bad, as iOS 6 is pretty new.<br />
But also fix them if you can. What is done is done.<br /></p>

<p>But it seems you are also using methods/symbols that were deprecated on iOS 4.2!<br />
This is actually a concern. iOS 4 support is currently dropping, so your actual code might not work for long.</p>

<p>So read the doc (again), learn about the new methods, and fix your code.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifier320x50 - deprecated in iOS 4.2
</code></pre>

<p>In the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/Reference/ADBannerView_Ref/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, you can read the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifier320x50 Indicates that the banner view is
  320 points by 50 points in size. This size is used on iPhone for
  portrait advertisements. <strong>(Deprecated. Use
  ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait instead.)</strong> Available in iOS 4.0
  and later. Deprecated in iOS 4.2. Declared in
  ADBannerView_Deprecated.h.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So instead of <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifier320x50</code>, simply use <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait</code>.<br />
Same for <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifier480x32</code>. Use <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierLandscape</code> instead.</p>

<p>You'll then be safe, and you'll no longer have a warning about this.</p>

<p>Then simply do the same for the other symbols.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>As stated on your comment, <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait</code> and <code>ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierLandscape</code> are also deprecated on iOS 6.</p>

<p>This is related to the deprecation of <code>setCurrentContentSizeIdentifier</code> and <code>setRequiredContentSizeIdentifiers</code>.</p>

<p>Apple recommends not to use that approach anymore, and use the <strong>auto-resizing</strong> capabilities of iOS.</p>
