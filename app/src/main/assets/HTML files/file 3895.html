<p>The <code>Uri</code> class has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9hst1w91.aspx" rel="nofollow">constructor</a> that you can use for that exactly. Given a base uri, which is your <code>originatingUrl</code> and a string (the relative part) it generates the full url. As far as I can see there is not a single thing in your method that cannot be done using the <code>Uri</code> class (maybe a few instances). My guess is that you could rewrite it to 5-10 LOC. </p>
