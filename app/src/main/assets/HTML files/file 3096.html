<p>You could add a <code>Service</code> with an AIDL interface or a <code>ContentProvider</code> in a future release of the free app, then use that to import the data into the paid app. Depending on the data, that might require some homebrew "licensing" mechanism to make sure only your paid app is allowed to use the published interfaces.</p>
