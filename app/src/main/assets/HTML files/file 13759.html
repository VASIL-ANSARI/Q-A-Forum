<h2>For Asp.net 4.0</h2>

<p>If you are using Asp.net 4.0 version than have look to this : <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34151/ASP-NET-4-0-Client-ID-Feature" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET 4.0 Client ID Feature</a></p>

<p><strong>Control.ClientIDMode Property</strong> -Gets or sets the algorithm that is used to generate the value of the ClientID property.</p>

<p><strong>AutoID</strong> 
 The ClientID value is generated by concatenating the ID values of each parent naming container with the ID value of the control. In data-binding scenarios where multiple instances of a control are rendered, an incrementing value is inserted in front of the control's ID value. Each segment is separated by an underscore character (_). This algorithm was used in versions of ASP.NET earlier than ASP.NET 4.</p>

<p><strong>Static</strong> 
 The ClientID value is set to the value of the ID property. If the control is a naming container, the control is used as the top of the hierarchy of naming containers for any controls that it contains.</p>

<p><strong>Predictable</strong> 
 This algorithm is used for controls that are in data-bound controls. The ClientID value is generated by concatenating the ClientID value of the parent naming container with the ID value of the control. If the control is a data-bound control that generates multiple rows, the value of the data field specified in the ClientIDRowSuffix property is added at the end. For the GridView control, multiple data fields can be specified. If the ClientIDRowSuffix property is blank, a sequential number is added at the end instead of a data-field value. This number begins at zero and is incremented by 1 for each row. Each segment is separated by an underscore character (_).</p>

<p><strong>Inherit</strong> 
 The control inherits the ClientIDMode setting of its NamingContainer control.</p>
