<p>Unless the two different web pages in the two different tabs have some relationship to each other, it will explicitly <strong>not</strong> be allowed because it would be a serious security vulnerability.</p>

<p>Imagine the security and privacy issues I'd have if I visited your web site and you had code to iterate and interact with any other tabs I happened to have open in my browser!</p>

<p>However, your pages <em>can</em> interact if they have a relationship. For example, if one tab was <em>opened</em> by a link from the page in the other tab. In this case, your code that does the opening would have to save a reference to the window variable of the page it opened.</p>

<p>You would then be able to call myOtherWindow.document.getElemetnId() and (for the most part) interact with it just as you do the current page.</p>
