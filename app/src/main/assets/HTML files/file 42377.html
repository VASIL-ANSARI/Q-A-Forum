<p>Basically the PageTransformer's transformPage() method return the wrong position when you play with padding and margin on the view pager. Seems to be a framework bug as stated <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=64046" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please see my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28169806/795245">answer</a> in this related question providing a workaround.</p>
