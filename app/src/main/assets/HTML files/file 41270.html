<p>Seems like you having this line in your console application config:</p>

<pre><code>'request' =&gt; [
   'enableCookieValidation' =&gt; ...
],
</code></pre>

<p>You should delete it because <code>yii\console\Request</code> compare to <code>yii\web\Request</code> simply doesn't have that property.</p>
