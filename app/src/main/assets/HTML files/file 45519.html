<p>It is probably because the binary files are not provided correctly. I had a similar issue with my SonarQube configuration, then I discovered that the classes that implement <code>Serializable</code> are in different modules and/or in an external library. </p>

<p>Setting correct values for <code>sonar.java.binaries</code> and <code>sonar.java.libraries</code> allow SonarQube to locate the binaries and correctly determine whether or not the classes are serializable.</p>
