<p>To interpret JavaScript strings as JavaScript themselves, you should probably use the <code>eval</code> function...  But heed my warning, if there is any form of user-input, or if you need complex debugging, you're going to run into some walls, and it will hurt.</p>

<p>JavaScript's <code>eval</code> takes string input and interprets it, simple as that...  Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>var test = "var example = 5;";
eval(test);
console.log(example);
</code></pre>

<p>Simple as that...</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is some instances where eval can be dangerous!</p>

<p>Lets say you had the following code for some reason:</p>

<pre><code>dbModule.syncConnection(function(database){
  eval("var test = '" + someUserInput + "'");
});
</code></pre>

<p>With this, a user can easily bypass what you've set by inputting something like this:</p>

<pre><code>"'; database.query('DELETE EVERYTHING MWAHAHA'); '"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>eval</code> function would then turn into:</p>

<pre><code>var test = ''; database.query('DELETE EVERYTHING MWAHAHA'); ''
</code></pre>

<p>...  So this just one simple example on how <code>eval</code> can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there isn't really any other safe way to check JavaScript before interpreting it, unless you run through the string yourself and disallow certain possible attacks....</p>

<p>But remember, anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  And with user-input, there is infinite possibilities.</p>
