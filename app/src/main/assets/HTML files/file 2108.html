<p>No and NSArrays 's do not end in a nil. </p>

<p>What does need a nil is initilaising an array with a set of objects using arrayWithObjects: or initWithObjects: Here the nil is required to tell at runtime when the list of objects ends as happens with any C variable arguments function e.g. using va_args</p>
