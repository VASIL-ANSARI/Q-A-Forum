<p>I would probably use some tool to normalize the HTML regardless of what editor the users have chosen, and tell everyone to run it before commiting. To ensure that has been done, you can block commits in the svn pre commit hook. If, for instance the HTML is supposed to be well formed XHTML, you could write such a hook with <code>xmllint --format</code> to make sure the incoming XML matches that of the xmllinted one, or you reject the commit. That way you can force your users to run a <code>prepare</code> script or similar before they commit.</p>
