<p>One problem is in this function:</p>

<pre><code>void insert_node(list_node *the_head, char the_char){
    list_node * current_node = the_head;
    while (current_node-&gt;next_node != NULL) {
        current_node = current_node-&gt;next_node;
    }

    current_node-&gt;next_node = malloc(sizeof(list_node));
    current_node-&gt;next_node-&gt;the_char = the_char;
    current_node-&gt;next_node-&gt;next_node = NULL;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you call it in <code>main</code> you're basically passing in <code>NULL</code> because you're setting <code>the_head</code> to <code>NULL</code>. You're trying to access <code>current_node-&gt;next_node</code> in the while loop conditions, but because of what you're passing in, you're basically doing <code>NULL-&gt;next_node</code>.  </p>

<p>You need to initialize your head to an empty <code>list_node</code>. Basically since you're using a <code>char</code> as your node element you could set the value of the char to <code>0x00</code>, which would make it a zero byte. Then that way you know that when you're at that value, you're at the head.</p>

<p>I don't mean to self-promote, but if you want to look at some code for this have a look at this github repo for the <a href="https://github.com/HugoSTorres/Barry_CS-331" rel="nofollow">Barry_CS-331 Data Structures class</a>. There's C and C++ in there for the Data Structures. I think it might have a list but if not you can use the stack and the queue as an overall example.</p>
