<p>I'd advise that you include the <code>Sidekiq::Web</code> to view the enqueued jobs on a web interface so you can see the parameters and possibly the failures triggered.</p>

<p>However, this is an error I also faced a while ago too, which quite frustrated me for a while because of the number of emails I received from my error notifier(Bugsnag).</p>

<p>I've not found the best solution yet, but I imagine that the database was being locked for reading or some records weren't committed before attempting to use them.</p>

<p>Sidekiq's documentation says in your model use, <code>after_commit :perform_sidekiq_job, on: :create</code>.</p>

<p>However, I've not really tried that because I found another approach, the flip side to my new approach is that my jobs are executed much later, at times about 10minutes later.</p>

<pre><code>RandomWorker.perform_in(5.seconds, user_id)
</code></pre>

<p>This is less likely to fail with the <code>Sidekiq::retry</code> option.</p>
