<p>Generally, once you check in a migration it should not be modified. For one project I was a part of, we reset the database on a regular basis and so people would modify migrations from time to time rather than create new ones, but it's not a practice I'm fond of.</p>

<p>So, if you want the default Rails migration behavior to work, no, don't change a migration that someone may have already used. However, if you are okay with working around the default behavior, it doesn't matter. Note: if you're running migrations on production to keep the database up to date, it's important that you never change a migration that has already been run on production!</p>
