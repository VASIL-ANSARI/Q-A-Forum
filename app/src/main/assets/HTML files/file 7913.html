<p>Could we have some example code?</p>

<p>Wouldn't this style of coding by easier and more suitable with a generic handler, rather than adding everything in the code behind a page? This would also clear some overheads, I believe.</p>

<p>Try using Chrome's developer tools, or an extension like Firebug for Firefox to view the source. This way you can view and manipulate the DOM. You also have other useful tools, such as a JavaScript console, which will log any errors.</p>
