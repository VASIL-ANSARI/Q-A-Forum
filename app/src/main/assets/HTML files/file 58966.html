<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements are added to the HTML document and the links are added to <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element. They do not share the same coordinate system. Unfortunately you cannot add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>.  It is probably easier to use another method for the flags instead of trying to coordinate both systems. You could use separate images for each flag and use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>.</p>
