<p>Looks like you're wanting to do this on both Android and iOS; things work a bit differently on each platform. Using the <code>cordova-plugin-file</code> plugin:</p>

<p>o The alias for the Android application folder (<code>file:///android_asset/</code>) is <code>cordova.file.applicationDirectory</code>.</p>

<p>o As you probably already know, the alias for the Android SD card root (<code>file:///storage/emulated/0/</code>) is <code>cordova.file.externalRootDirectory</code>.</p>

<p>o The alias for the iOS application folder (<code>appname.app/</code>) is <code>cordova.file.applicationDirectory</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously there's no external storage to write to on iOS, but depending on what you want to do with the file and who needs to access it you could write it to your documents (<code>Documents/</code> -> <code>cordova.file.documentsDirectory</code>) or library (<code>Library/NoCloud/</code> -> <code>cordove.file.dataDirectory</code>) folder.</p>
