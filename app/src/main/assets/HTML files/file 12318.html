<p><code>THREE.MeshLambertMaterial</code> extends <code>THREE.Material</code> which means it inherits the <code>opacity</code> property, so all you need to do is access the material on your object, and change the opacity of the material:</p>

<pre><code>object.materials[0].opacity = 1 + Math.sin(new Date().getTime() * .0025);//or any other value you like
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that the material must have it's <code>transparent</code> property set to true.</p>

<pre><code>object.materials[0].transparent = true;
</code></pre>

<p>(Thank you Drew and Dois for pointing this out)</p>

<p>I know that there are problems with the three.js 'reference', but you can have a look at the source file for the class you use and see all the properties/methods it has and if it extends anything else.</p>
