<p>Orchard, by default, allows a single content item to be assigned to single list, but you are free to create your own implementation. It's not that difficult to implement as it may seem. The fact that such feature is not there is because the Team focused on more important things (like performance) lately.</p>

<p>Take a look at <strong>Orchard.Core.Containers</strong> and <strong>Orchard.Lists</strong> to see how they are implemented. You could, for example, create your own part that would allow attaching an arbitrary item to different lists and create a controller that would build the final shape. </p>

<p>Check the <strong>Orchard.Core.Containers.Controllers.ItemController</strong> - there the whole magic happens. Id of a corresponding container (which you choose from the select list "<em>Add to:")</em> is held inside CommonPart.Container.Id property so you can follow this pattern and create a part that would hold a collection of Ids, attach that to content types you want and do the rendering exactly like in that ItemController. </p>
