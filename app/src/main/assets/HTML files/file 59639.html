<p>Whenever you have a set of similar objects donÂ´t create a variable for every instance of those objects, instead put them into one single collection. Then you can easily loop this list and manipulate the objects within it:</p>

<pre><code>var buttons = new List&lt;Button&gt;();

// put the buttons into the list using buttons.Add

for (var b in buttons)
{
    if (b.text == "true")
    {
        b.textcolor = blue
    }
    else 
    {
        b.textcolor = red
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use a <code>GridView</code> to put all those buttons into a ragular grid.</p>
