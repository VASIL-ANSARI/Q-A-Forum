<p>The problem is largely caused by Turbolinks. One way I've often worked around it, is to disable Turbolink entirely or disable it for specific portions of your code.
To disable globally, in your <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code> you could remove the line that requires the turbolinks.</p>
