<p>UICollectionView has a delegate which provides a method </p>

<pre><code>- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView
didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
</code></pre>

<p>When an item is tapped, the function above is called. Based on indexPath you can determine which item was selected. 
In your storyboard, create a new UIViewController and create a segue from your UICollectionView to this UIViewController and make the segue as Push and name it 'collectionViewToUIViewController'.
In your didSelectItemAtIndexPath, call method</p>

<pre><code>[self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"collectionViewToUIViewController"]
</code></pre>

<p>Also implement <code>prepareForSegue</code> where you tell the UIViewController what to display.</p>
