<p>finally it seems that there aren't problems.<br/>
Although each request create a handler, it will be remove from list and will be cleared when garbage collector is called.<br/>
To try it I force the gc and every CometHandler that is not in the suspended list is finalized.<br/>
I try to force a lot of new request and the garbage collector is called when there are a lot of comet handler instantiated, so I still don't like so much this approach.<br/>
Every new idea is welcome.<br/>
