<p>You need to add Else to you If or replace with</p>

<pre><code>Material1.Visible = Not (Fields("Material1").Value = "Cotton")
</code></pre>

<p>that way it turns on or off based on the value.   When you set the property you're setting it on the instance for the whole control, the subreport has only one instance not one for each detail.</p>

<p>hope this helps.</p>
