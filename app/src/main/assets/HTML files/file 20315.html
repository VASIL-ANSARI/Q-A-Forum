<p>"This" has scope issues. The "this" that you refer to in ajaxFormSubmit is the context of the ajaxFormSubmit , not the click handler of the link. You need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$form = $('form[data-ucw-ajax="true"]');
</code></pre>

<p>or give the form an ID and use:</p>

<pre><code>$form = $('#myForm');
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I would move Jquery to another bundle to ensure it is loaded before all the other libraries.</p>
