<pre><code>//your log record
string record = "Thu Mar 02 1995 21:31:00,2245107...";

//get the first part - you can include the Thu Mar 02 1995 (datetime can parse)
string date = record.Split(',')[0];

//parse to date time (the Thu Mar 02 doesn't phase dateTime)
DateTime dt = DateTime.Parse(date);

//convert the datetime to a string HH = 24 Hours leading zero, mm = minutes, ss = seconds
string time = dt.ToString("HH:mm:ss");

//write!
Console.WriteLine(time);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>edit</strong> I see you say don't process the date, this technically processes it - but it's a lot cleaner than splitting up based on spaces and rebuilding the time piece by piece.</p>
