<p>It seems you can just add a conditional to check for that specific status. If request is your XMLHttpRequest object, then additionally check status when readyState is 4:</p>

<pre><code>if(request.readyState == 4){
  if(request.status == 302) {
    doSomething();
  }
  else {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>or, alternately, if you don't want to use straight javascript (since in fairness you did tag it as jquery-ajax), then something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  statusCode: {
    302: function() {
      doSomething();
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
