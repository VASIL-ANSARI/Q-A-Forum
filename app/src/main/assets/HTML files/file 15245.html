<p>One solution would be, include the logout button and if any layout associated with it, within 
include tags in the layout file. Like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;include&gt; &lt;/include&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this, you at least don't have to create it multiple times.</p>

<p>To call it, in the click listener of the button, use a method with context as the parameter in a Global class. So that, you can call it from all the activities, avoiding the need for rewriting the code again.</p>
