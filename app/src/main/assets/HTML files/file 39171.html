<p>For anyone interested in the answer : I guess there are several possible reasons, in our case, it was a problem in the web page. Before requesting the story review we made several tests using "test apps" (fake apps with limited access), but the guy in charge of the web page forgot to update the app id in the meta-data after the story was accepted. So when a user not registered as developer of the test app tried to view a publication referring to this page, FB was confused... <br/>
After the correct app id was set in the page meta-data, everything worked correctly.<br/>
Why did FB permit to publish the action in the first place, this I do not know ;)</p>
