<p>As for specification in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<p>When an element has applied <code>pointer-events: none;</code></p>

<p>The element is <strong>never</strong> the target of <strong>any</strong> mouse events and any events are void;</p>

<p>Please look at this demonstration:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/wewosumehi/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/wewosumehi/1/</a></p>

<p>Events are not being fired, you cannot even scroll the <code>container</code>.</p>
