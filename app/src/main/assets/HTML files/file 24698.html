<p>You don't use the G score to calculate the heuristic, the G score is added to the heuristic (H score) to get an estimate from the node to the goal (F score). </p>

<p>Euclidean distance is the line illustrated in this image:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w7kJP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Which, using the two points (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>h(n) = sqrt((x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +
  (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you can omit <code>sqrt()</code> completely as it's quite a costly operation to perform so many times. Also prefer <code>float</code> over <code>double</code> as operations on <code>float</code>s are much faster.</p>

<p>So try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>float x = Math.pow(destination.getX() - currentNode.getX(), 2.0);
float y = Math.pow(destination.getX() - currentNode.getX(), 2.0);

return x + y;
</code></pre>

<p>I assume you can substitute x and y for long/lat in some fashion (I haven't done much geospatial programming). <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html" rel="nofollow">This article</a> seems relevant, looks like you need to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula" rel="nofollow">haversine formula</a> to calculate the distance.</p>

<p>I wrote an article on A* about a year ago which you may find helpful <a href="http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2012/06/a-pathfinding-algorithm.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
