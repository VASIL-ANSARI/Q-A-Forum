<p>I think you could approach this one of two ways:</p>

<p>1) Know in your app which fields have been removed and remove them on update as you do in your question.</p>

<p>2) Script it as a batch job.  This probably does what you need: It forcibly removes any empty field (that is, empty string value) in any document in a collection (collection 'so' in this case)</p>

<pre><code>var updateEmptyField = function(o){ 
   for (var f in o){ 
      if (o[f] === ''){ 
         eval ("db.so.update({},{$unset: {" + f + ":1}},false,true);");
      }
   }
}

db.so.find().forEach(updateEmptyField);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use eval here to use the  variable holding the field name.</p>
