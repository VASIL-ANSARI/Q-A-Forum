<p>The exact layout of bitfields in memory is not specified by the standard. However, I'm fairly convinced that if you use <code>unsigned int</code> for all your fields, like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct Data
{
    unsigned int i:2;
    unsigned int r:14;
    unsigned int c:14;
};
</code></pre>

<p>your data will be packed into one 30-bit integer value. However, since you have declared the first field a char, it can not hold a 14-bit value, and thus is seen as a separate field. </p>

<p>(gcc gives 4 bytes for both variants, which is one reason I say that there are differences between compilers - hence nothing in the standard stating that the fields are not defined in the standard)</p>
