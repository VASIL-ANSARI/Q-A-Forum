<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa373208%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">SetThreadExecutionState</a> will tell the system not to go into sleep mode, it can also reset the idle timer.</p>

<p>If you know the time limit, you could use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646302%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GetLastInputInfo</a> with a simple subtraction to know how much time you have left before the system goes to sleep.</p>
