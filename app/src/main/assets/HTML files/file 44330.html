<p>Is it true that <code>false == true</code>? I think it is apparent that this is not true, thus <code>(false == true)</code> is <code>false</code> and therefor <code>false == (false == true)</code> (as we've already noticed that the second part is false).</p>

<p>As for the first example - actually no matter the order of evaluation it will hold true(I leave that to you as a logical exercise). Still javascript guarantees the evaluation order to be left to right thus this expression is the same as<code>(false == false) == true</code>. Again I leave to you to prove this is true. </p>
