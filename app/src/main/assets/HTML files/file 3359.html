<p>You should replace users' links with your own special links (e.g. <a href="http://yoursite.com/redirect.ashx?http://external.com" rel="nofollow">http://yoursite.com/redirect.ashx?http://external.com</a>) when they save their data or, the better way, when you are serving user-generated contents to other users.</p>
