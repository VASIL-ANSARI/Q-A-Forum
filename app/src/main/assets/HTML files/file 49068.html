<p>I'm answering since we have found a solution (and a comment confirmed we are on the right way).<br>
In order to define whether the current system locale is RTL or LTR, we should use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318103.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>GetLocaleInfoEx</code></a> with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373806.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>LOCALE_IREADINGLAYOUT</code></a>. MSDN says the following about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows 7 and later: The reading layout for text. Possible values are defined in the following table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possible values actually are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0</code> â left-to-right (as in English);</li>
<li><code>1</code> â right-to-left (as in Hebrew or Arabic);</li>
<li><code>2</code> â Either read vertically from top to bottom with columns going from right to left, or read in horizontal rows from left to right (as in Japanese);</li>
<li><code>3</code> â Read vertically from top to bottom with columns going from left to right (as in Mongolian).</li>
</ul>
