<p>It seems that the App Store has two main rules when it comes to in-app purchases (IAP):</p>

<ol>
<li>Buying physical goods or services outside the app using the in-app purchase API is not allowed</li>
<li>Using something other than the in-app purchase API to purchase content, functionality, or services in an app is not allowed</li>
</ol>

<p>Amazon is Ok on both these, but I don't know enough about the Zong, Paypal or Boku apps.</p>
