<p>It's because Java erases type at runtime, so the Collection doesn't know what type it's actually dealing with. It's a limiting factor when using Java generics - I've bumped heads with it before a few years ago but I couldn't figure out a way to get around it and it turned out to be a language restriction.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is create a <code>public T getMinVolume(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list)</code> method to iterate through each T.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>public T getMinVolume(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list) {
    T min = null;
    for(T item: list) {
        if (min == null) {
            min = item;
        }

        if (min &gt; item) {
            min = item;
        }
    }

    return min;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Something like that, my Java is a bit rusty but the logic should work.</p>
