<p>Well if I were you, I would create a Repository interface, and create an implementation to it, in this implementation I would add all my queries, and then the variable filter would be passed as an argument, then in my controller I would inject my interface (which is really simple using laravel).
So I end up with an application which is extensible, if I ever want to switch from MySQL to another database all I have to do is to create a new implementation and configure laravel to use the new implementation. That's how I do it. if you want to learn more about the Repository pattern, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/600097/Why-the-Repository-Pattern" rel="nofollow">here's a good article.</a></p>
