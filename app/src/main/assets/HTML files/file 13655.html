<p>You should try to just use a if statement for this one. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($("#el").val() == "123") {
    // Do something or nothing here.

} else if (!$(Form1).valid()) {
    alert("invalid form")

} else {
    // All correct

}
</code></pre>

<p>What <em>philnate</em> says should also work fine. It's more what <em>you</em> want to happen.</p>
