<p>The loop is because the stream doesn't extract the character that is not an integer. You need to extract it before attempting to read another integer.</p>

<p>A small tweak could be all that is needed;</p>

<pre><code>// on a failed read...
file.clear();
char dummy;
file &gt;&gt; dummy;
continue;
</code></pre>

<p>A side note on the use of <code>while (!file.eof())</code>; it is generally not recommended to do this. There are several Q&amp;A on SO on this issue.</p>
