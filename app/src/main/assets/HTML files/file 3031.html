<p>Maxmize button is unavailable on two conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>For a Dialog, in which case only close(X) button is availabe.</li>
<li>If frame.setResizable(false) has been called(i.e diabled resize of window)</li>
</ol>

<p>So applying this to your case, my best guess is that somewhere in your button's action you may have made it unresizable.</p>
