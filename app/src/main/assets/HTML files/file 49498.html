<p>The problem here is that you have block elements (<em>i.e. the <code>#view</code> divs</em>) inside of a fixed block element. So the relative <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> style of the <code>#wrapper</code> div forces those block elements to be relatively positioned. This won't ever let your scroll within the div itself or span the page scroll in rendering.</p>

<p>Instead you should consider just positioning the <code>wrapper</code> div with a fixed <code>top</code> say <code>20px</code> and the page should behave as you expect it to. Unfortunately centering the div vertically on the page relative to its own height is not ideal in CSS. That's why front-end frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> have an <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix" rel="nofollow">Affix</a> method in javascript. I don't think that's what you actually want though. I think you're trying to center the div vertically and horizontally on the page, but the div does not have a fixed size so this is not exactly going to work out very well for you when the div expands dynamically as you can see. Just set a fixed top margin instead to avoid this problem altogether and don't worry so much about centering it vertically.</p>
