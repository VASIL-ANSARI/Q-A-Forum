<p>It is necessary one more line of code.</p>

<p>This is the final solution:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            JFrame _mf= new MainFrame();
            _mf.setVisible(true);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please remember that every kind of operation that involves a Swing object has to be performed by the <strong>Event Dispatch Thread</strong>, so also the creation and visualization  of the first JFrame.</p>
