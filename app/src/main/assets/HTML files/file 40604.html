<p>Yeah, you will probably need to store each user's GPS coordinates somewhere in a database. Then you can draw annotations on Apple's map view or on a map view that Google provides in their iOS helper once you fetch information from the database. I would not constantly update the user's map though.  You should update it every 5 minutes, or when the user asks for it to be refreshed either through a button or some other form. Also if you plan to find the nearest user to them from the database I recommend using the Haversine Forumula (<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula" rel="nofollow">http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula</a>).</p>
