<p>I'm no PHP expert, but I think your redundant use of loanprovider in the switch statement is a clue. I think if you don't set loanprovider you will have an empty value of some sort, which goes in the parameter to switch, and then you use a similar value in the case. assume <code>(int)$_GET["loanprovider"]</code> is 0. Then the expression <code>(int)$_GET["loanprovider"] &gt; 1</code> will also return 0 because 0 is not greater than 1. What you end up with is essentially:</p>

<pre><code>switch (0) {
case 0:
  // your code
  break;
default:
  break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because 0 == 0, you end up in the first case.</p>
