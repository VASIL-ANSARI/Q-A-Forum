<p>.load is simply unreliable on images, crossbrowser.  Firefox will not fire it when loading the image from cache, for instance. Check out the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load-event/" rel="nofollow">jQuery docs for .load</a>.</p>

<p>One section reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caveats of the load event when used with images</p>
  
  <p>A common challenge developers attempt to solve using the .load() shortcut is to execute a function when an image (or collection of images) have completely loaded. There are several known caveats with this that should be noted. These are:</p>
  
  <p>It doesn't work consistently nor reliably cross-browser<br>
  It doesn't fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as before<br>
  It doesn't correctly bubble up the DOM tree<br>
  Can cease to fire for images that already live in the browser's cache  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, creating an image object, binding a handler to it's load event, and then setting the src works more reliably if that strategy is possible.</p>
