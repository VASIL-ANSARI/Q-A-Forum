<p>Remove the <code>to_param</code>. When you're using the URL helpers, such as your <code>member_follows_path</code>, you need to pass the ID, or from the ERB's perspective, the object itself (it'll resolve to the ID when the ERB renders)</p>

<p>Alternatively, in your rails controller, change the <code>find</code> to something like <code>find_by_user_name</code>, or whatever the field is supposed to be, and then that line should work. Beware that this will be slower, especially if you have a large database without proper indexing / partitioning.</p>
