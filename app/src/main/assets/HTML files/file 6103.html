<p>Not really an answer, but maybe your code should be changed so rather than you having to hack up the date object you just pass in the date as an argument, that way you can just pass in whatever you want to unit test that method/code.</p>

<p>Another option would be to make a date interface of some kind then mock that out to return whatever you want, mockito may be able to let you make a dummy date object if its not final and you could then get that to return whatever you want.</p>
