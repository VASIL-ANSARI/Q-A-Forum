<p>i came across the same problem recently, what i ended up doing was using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template id="templateContent"&gt;
     &lt;style&gt; @import "css/generalStyle.css"; &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>additional info: this worked just fine except, now i'm having some cache issues as Chrome does not seem to reload those ressources after a hard reload.</p>
