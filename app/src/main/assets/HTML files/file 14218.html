<p>This is easy to do as a type level constraint.  You just create something like</p>

<pre><code>@CascadingNotNull(ifNotNull="otherProperty", thenAlsoNotNull="myProperty")
</code></pre>

<p>If you put that on the class, then in your ConstraintHandler you can use whatever flavour of reflect/bean library you like to get the two properties and do the check.</p>
