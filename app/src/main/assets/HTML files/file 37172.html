<p>I managed to fix it by adding the following rule to my nginx config</p>

<pre><code>if (!-e $request_filename)
{
    rewrite ^(.+)$ /index.php?q=$1 last;
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the following website <a href="http://www.farinspace.com/wordpress-nginx-rewrite-rules/" rel="nofollow">Farinspace - Wordpress nginx rewrite rules</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps someone else who had the same problem as me.</p>
