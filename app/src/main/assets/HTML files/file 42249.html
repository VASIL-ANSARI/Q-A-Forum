<p>I propose two workarounds to your problem, if you can't solve it :</p>

<ol>
<li>Validate your bean after JAXB unmarshaling</li>
<li>Use CXF Validation Feature </li>
</ol>

<h2>Validation after JAXB unmarshaling</h2>

<p>I think you can add a JAXB callback afterUnmarshal() in your Java request bean (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/Unmarshaller.html#unmarshalEventCallback" rel="nofollow" title="doc">as described here</a>), and perform all validation you want in it (format validation, or others).</p>

<p>For example : </p>

<pre><code>@XmlRootElement
public class YourRequest {

    @XmlElement(required = true)
    protected String number;

    // some code here

    public void afterUnmarshal(Unmarshaller unmarshaller, Object parent) {
       if(number == null) {
           // Throw validation exception
       }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<h2>CXF Validation feature </h2>

<p>Another possibility is to use Bean Validation with CXF (<a href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/validationfeature.html" rel="nofollow">as documented here</a>). Usually, it's not necessary for a schema-based validation, but if you need to have a more complex validation than a schema-based one, I think it can be a solution to your problem after all.</p>

<p>I hope it can help you while waiting a better answer.</p>
