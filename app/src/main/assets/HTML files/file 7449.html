<p>you only need 2, or 3 views, and dynamically change their content.
2 views you could cross fade by making the top view transparent, then changing it's content, then making it opaque changing the back views content, making the front view transparent again...if you wanted to fade to black or white you could have a middle view that you fade to.</p>
