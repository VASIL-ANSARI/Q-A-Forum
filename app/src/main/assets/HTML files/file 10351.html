<p>I don't know of an existing library, but I also recently searched how to send notifications to my droid using Python, and I came throuht <a href="http://blog.boxedice.com/2010/10/07/android-push-notifications-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> which explains how C2DM works and gives a sample Python implementation. I didn't test it yet, but I believe it could be useful as a base at least.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://nma.usk.bz/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> which offers the ability to send C2DM notifications to your droid via their servers using an API, and there's even a <a href="https://github.com/uskr/pynma" rel="nofollow">python library</a> to access it more easily.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>To use NotifyMyAndroid, it seems you have to install their software on your phone (of I didn't understand how it works ^^)</p>
