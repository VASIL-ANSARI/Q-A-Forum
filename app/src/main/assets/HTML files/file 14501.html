<p>Here are some things you can adjust:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wrap your list item contents in spans and apply the list item arrow to the spans instead, give the span a padding-left value slightly larger than the arrow gif's width.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't use the list-style-image property, just specify a list-style: none; to get left alignment x-browser.  Generally you should just use the background image property for list items instead of the list-style-image, but since you have a background image for li's too, you need the extra span.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't apply padding to the same elements you apply widths and heights.  They will not render cross-browser.  Instead specify width/height on a parent element and padding on an inner wrapper element. </p></li>
<li><p>generally you should avoid id rules, they are heavily specific and result in non-reusable style definitions.  They make overriding the style definition difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the list items touch each other, make sure the line-height specified on them is equal to or less than the height of the elements.  I think the list-item-style will fix it, but double check this setting too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If that doesn't fix your problem, post a link to the background images and I'll mock up a small example.</p>
