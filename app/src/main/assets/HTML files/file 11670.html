<p>If you just want to separate the components you can try using the <code>componentsSeperatedByString:</code> method. As a result you will be getting an array of objects which you can use to iterate for uploading. </p>

<pre><code>[yourString componentsSeparatedByString:separatorString];
</code></pre>

<p>hope this helps.</p>
