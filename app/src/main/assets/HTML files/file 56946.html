<p>Unless the data you're fetching from that remote site has leading<code>/</code> in the path/filename, you're not generating proper paths:</p>

<pre><code>$file = 'foo.txt'; // example only
$dest = "destFolder" . $file;
</code></pre>

<p>produces <code>destFolderfoo.txt</code>, and you end up littering your script's working directory with a bunch of wonky filenames. Perhaps you wanted</p>

<pre><code>$dest = 'destFolder/' . $file;
                   ^----note this
</code></pre>

<p>instead.</p>
