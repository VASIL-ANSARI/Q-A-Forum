<p>By default Jersey creates a new instance of the resource class for every request. So if you don't annotate the Jersey resource class, it implicitly uses <code>@RequestScoped</code> scope. It is stated in <a href="https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/jaxrs-resources.html#d0e1851">Jersey documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Default lifecycle (applied when no annotation is present). In this
  scope the resource instance is created for each new request and used
  for processing of this request. If the resource is used more than one
  time in the request processing, always the same instance will be used.
  This can happen when a resource is a sub resource is returned more
  times during the matching. In this situation only on instance will
  server the requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most cases you use this default setting so you don't use <code>@Singleton</code> scope. You can also create a singleton Jersey resource class by using <code>@Singleton</code> annotation. Then you need to register the singleton class in the <code>MyApplication</code> class, e.g., </p>

<pre><code>@Path("/resource")
@Singleton
public class JerseySingletonClass {
    //methods ...
}

public class MyApplication extends ResourceConfig {

    /*Register JAX-RS application components.*/
    public MyApplication () {
        register(JerseySingletonClass.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
