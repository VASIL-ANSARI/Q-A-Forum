<p>Samples are only for demonstration purpose. Since JMS is relatively heavy connection it's not recommended to establish connections per message. you can simply modify the code to send multiple message with same session. Based on attached code you can use simple for loop to send 5 messages.</p>

<pre><code>public void publishMessage(String msg) throws NamingException, JMSException {
   TextMessage textMessage = topicSession.createTextMessage(msg);
   for(int i=0; i&lt;5; i++){
        topicPublisher.publish(textMessage);
   }
}
</code></pre>
