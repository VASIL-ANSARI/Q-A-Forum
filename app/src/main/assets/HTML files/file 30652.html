<p>I found out what the problem was.
The default configuration file for my JBoss server was standalone.xml while the connectionFactory is configured in the standalone-full.xml file which is a more full version of the standalone.xml, So all I had to do was change the configuration file of the server from standalone.xml to standalone-full.xml and that did the trick :@)~</p>
