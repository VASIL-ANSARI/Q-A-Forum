<p>Could you get what you want from the columnMap function in the model?</p>

<pre><code>$model = new Profile();
$columns = $model-&gt;columnMap();
</code></pre>

<p>This will return an array of all columns. Possible create another similar function to just return the columns you want? Perhaps what you're trying to achieve is more involved. </p>

<p>BTW I got the same error using the modelManager.</p>
