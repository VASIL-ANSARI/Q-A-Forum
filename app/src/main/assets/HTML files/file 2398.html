<p>I didn't check that but I'm not sure that Jetty will pick up all the jars that are referenced in the manifest of <code>gf-client.jar</code> (refer to the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html#StandaloneRemoteEJB" rel="nofollow">GlassFish EJB FAQ</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2087938/glassfish-v3-jndi-entry-cannot-be-found-problems/2090701#2090701">this previous answer</a> for more details on that). So, while I'm sure that this JAR works well when using a standalone client (because I tested this), I didn't try with an embedded Jetty. </p>

<p>So, please try to add the following JARs manually: <code>glassfish-naming.jar</code>, <code>internal-api.jar</code>, <code>javax.ejb.jar</code>, <code>hk2-core.jar</code>, <code>auto-depends.jar</code>, <code>glassfish-api.jar</code>.</p>
