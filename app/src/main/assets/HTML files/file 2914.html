<p>From what I understand you are trying to do an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/default.asp" rel="nofollow">AJAX</a> call. If you were to use a framework like <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a>, the code would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>if ((typeof nation != 'undefined') &amp;&amp; (typeof service != 'undefined') &amp;&amp; (typeof slider != 'undefined')) {
    $.get("&lt;your script&gt;", function(data){
         alert("Data Received: " + data);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>If this is not what you are looking for, please rephrase your question.</p>
