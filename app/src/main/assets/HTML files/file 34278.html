<p>Try performing the subtraction with 32-bit and 64-bit.</p>

<p>1:No overflow.  The difference of <code>x-x</code> is <code>0</code> and is representable as a 32-bit <code>int</code>.  This is expected regardless of what integer value/type <code>x</code> may be.</p>

<p>0:Overflow.  The difference of <code>x-y</code> (or <code>-2147483648 - 1879048192</code>) is arithmetically <code>-4026531840</code> and is <em>not</em> representable as a 32-bit <code>int</code>.  The result of the below code provided a difference of <code>268435456</code>.  But <code>int</code> overflow is undefined behavior, so the result here may differ on another machine.</p>

<p>Overflow with subtraction occurs when the arithmetically correct difference does not match the computed difference.</p>
