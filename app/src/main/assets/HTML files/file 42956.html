<p>This is typical business "logic" with many cases/rules. It pays to make a declarative solution for this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;when category="Region" value="Russia"/&gt;
    &lt;when category="Site" value="MailRu"/&gt;
    &lt;action category="Address" value="abc"/&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This allows to build in diagnostics, integrity checks, log uncovered cases, make historical logs for future analysis on future bug reports.</p>

<p>It might even be more readable. Transformable in a nice HTML table hierarchy for manager level documentation.</p>

<hr>

<p>It boils down to the fact that your code is procedural, without possibility to store the control-flow path taken. A model-driven approach can alleviate that. A DSL would be feasible, but I find a free form data approach to be a bit more creative, direct.</p>
