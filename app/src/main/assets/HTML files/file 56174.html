<p>I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of your approach is, but maybe you should have a look at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/BitSet.html" rel="nofollow">BitSet</a>? You could put your longs into an array, create a BitSet using valueOf and then use a data structure that's actually meant to be used for logical operations.</p>
