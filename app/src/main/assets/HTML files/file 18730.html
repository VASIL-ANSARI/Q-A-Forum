<p>I suggest you to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a quickstart java project with maven;</li>
<li>Add the dependencies that you want;</li>
<li>Put the java class in src/main/java</li>
<li><code>mvn clean install</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If it don't work, try some IDE, like eclipse. Open the project and try to fix the imports... It's always possible that some lib has changed, and maybe they change the name of the package.</p>
