<p>You must set all the properties of your <strong>serialPort1</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, you should try to debug at multiple place to help us where it's going wrong : Does <strong>IsOpen</strong> return true? if no, this explain why you receive nothing. </p>

<p>See MSDN example if you want to try something is supposed to work : <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.ports.serialport.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.ports.serialport.aspx</a></p>

<p>Be sure that the serial port is not alerady open by another program and you have selected the good <strong>COM PORT</strong>. Otherwise the code looks good. (You could also looks in the RxString value each time you are passing by. (maybe many empty space or "/r"))</p>
