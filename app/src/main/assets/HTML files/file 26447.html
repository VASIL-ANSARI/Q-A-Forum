<p>You have many options.</p>

<p>If you want to parse JSON in js just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4935684/1722236">check this post</a>. Use <code>JSON.parse()</code> if your client supports it or a javascript json lib. Then <code>myJsonObject.title</code> will return <code>"test"</code>, not depending of its position in the json.</p>

<p>You can also use eval() which is a native Js function but could execute malicious code if you're not sure about the JSON's origin.</p>

<p>But I would rather go with a GWT compatible utils like <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/json/client/JSONParser.html" rel="nofollow">JSONParser</a>. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3493372/1722236">This post</a> has some useful info about it. Be careful about using parseStrict() for the same reason (the parser inner mechanism also uses eval()).</p>
