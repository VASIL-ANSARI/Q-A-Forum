<p>I noticed when I updated to the iOS 4 SDK I had to enable my AirPort wireless and connected to a wireless network to actually get a fix on my location. It appears that Apple is using your wifi access point to pinpoint your location now. I noticed you mentioned you are connected to wifi though, which seems a bit odd. That is the only case I've come across in a couple years of developing using the simulator.</p>
