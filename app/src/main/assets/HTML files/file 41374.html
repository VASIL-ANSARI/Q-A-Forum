<p><code>super(simpleSuffixTree.text);</code> is a call to the constructor of the super-class <code>AbstractSuffixTree</code>. <code>simpleSuffixTree.text</code> is passed to the super-class's constructor, and it's probably used to initialize the "text" property of <code>AbstractSuffixTree</code>.</p>
