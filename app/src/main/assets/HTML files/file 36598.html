<p>I would kill any timers or Async work in <code>onStop()</code></p>

<p>Quoting the API doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stopped</strong><br>
      The fragment is not visible. Either the host activity has been stopped or the fragment has been removed from the activity but added
  to the back stack. A stopped fragment is still alive (all state and
  member information is retained by the system). However, it is no
  longer visible to the user and will be killed if the activity is
  killed.</p>
