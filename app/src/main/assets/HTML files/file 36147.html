<p>If your method is void, it doesn't make much sense to return false or true. Your method should probably be public boolean reverse(..).</p>

<p>For the code, i think this is faster (if i understand your question).</p>

<pre><code>String reverse = new StringBuffer(str2).reverse().toString();
return reverse.equals(str1);
</code></pre>
