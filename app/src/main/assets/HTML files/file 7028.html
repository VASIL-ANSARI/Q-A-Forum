<p><a href="http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_up_Visual_Studio_for_Unity">Unity has a wiki page</a> explaining how to do this. It seems that the latest version of Unity should already allow you to create a Visual Studio project (if you're running Windows). However, it <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/VisualStudioIntegration.html">seems only VS 2008</a> is supported natively. You can follow <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/62200-Visual-Studio-2010-issue">this workaround</a> to get it to work with VS2010 (except VS2010 Express Edition) to some degree.</p>
