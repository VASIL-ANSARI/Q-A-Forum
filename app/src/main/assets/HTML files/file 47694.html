<p>You should have a <code>belongsTo</code> relationship between <code>temp_readings</code> and <code>location</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>class temp_readings extends AppModel {

    public $belongsTo = [
        'location' // I don't know your data structure, but you'll probably need to add some details here
    ];

    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, after saving:</p>

<pre><code>function afterSave($created, $options = array()) {
    $temperature = $this-&gt;data['TemperatureReading']['temperature'] ;
    $location    = $this-&gt;data['Location'] ;
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this code needs changes because I don't know your database structure but it should give you a hint on what you should do.</p>
