<p>On a per-request basis (that is, looking at page load performance of JUST one page), speed-wise you actually take a small performance hit by separating the files.  But when looking at performance, you get a performance boost when loading multiple pages that utilize the same JS or same CSS.  In those cases, the content of the JS/CSS is only loaded once for all requests.</p>

<p>Although you didn't ask this as part of your question, it also helps code maintainability.  If you make one change in your CSS and it gets loaded across multiple pages, if you embed the JS/CSS in the page then you have to make the same change across all of your pages.</p>
