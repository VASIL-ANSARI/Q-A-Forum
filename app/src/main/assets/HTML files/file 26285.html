<p>Based on the comments, I will add an answer...</p>

<p>You need to actually <code>publish</code> the application: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20yh9f1b%28v=vs.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to publish a web app</a>.  You can publish this locally on your desktop and copy the files onto the server, or you can publish direct to your server.</p>

<p>When you publish the application, the <code>model(s)</code> get compiled into an <code>assembly</code> in your <code>bin</code> folder, so you cant directly modify these files on the fly.</p>

<p>You can chose a setting to allow for views to be updated, but this is very limited.</p>

<p>So, best approach is to set up a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff398069.aspx" rel="nofollow">publish profile</a> for your DEV server, and make your change, and then re-publish.  It will take you less than a minute to get the latest code on the server.</p>
