<p>if you want to extend the functionality of a system class. you need to follow this recomendations.</p>

<ol>
<li>place your extended class in <code>/application/core</code>, be sure that you name it exactly like the name and casing of the class created.</li>
<li>your class should extend from <code>CI_Model</code> or <code>CI_Controller</code>, depending on your needs. </li>
<li>wherever you implement your new class, be sure that you honor the same name casing from your extended class.</li>
<li>you should have configured the <code>$config['subclass_prefix']</code> on <code>/application/config/config.php</code>. let's say in your case with the value <code>'N_'</code></li>
</ol>

<p>what i can see from your code, you are not extending from <code>CI_Controller</code> and your path seems wrong. </p>

<p><strong>Informative note</strong>: the <code>/application/library</code> is used to place classes and libraries from 3rd parties that won't fit into CI schemas.</p>
