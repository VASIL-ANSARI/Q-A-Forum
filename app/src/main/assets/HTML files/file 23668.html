<p>You do this in two parts: The client side, and the server side.</p>

<h2>The Client Side</h2>

<p>This is <strong>purely</strong> to make the UI easier to use, because all data must be validated on the server as well. But making UIs easier to use is important.</p>

<p>Here's how you do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You hook the <code>submit</code> event of the form.</p></li>
<li><p>You loop through the form's elements (the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/html.html#ID-76728479" rel="nofollow"><code>elements</code> collection</a> on the form) and check that they have a non-blank <code>value</code> (for <code>input type="text"</code> and <code>textarea</code>) or, in the case of radio buttons, that at least one of the ones sharing the same <code>name</code> has a <code>checked</code> attribute that's <code>true</code>. (You've also said that you have groups of checkboxes where you need at least one to be checked, so that would be similar to the radio button stuff, although you have to group them differently, perhaps using the same CSS class, which is available on each <code>input</code> as <code>className</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you have any field that you don't feel is adequately filled in, you return <code>false</code> from the event handler for <code>submit</code>. Ideally you also show the user very clear instructions about what's missing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are about fifteen thousand "form validation" plug-ins to help you with this. HTML5 also has some form validation via markup now, but support isn't quite at the level you can rely on it yet.</p>

<h2>The Server Side</h2>

<p>When you receive the form, you must re-validate that all of the required information is present, because client-side validation can be circumvented. Naturally how you do this depends on the content of the form, but the variables will be available via <code>$_POST</code> (if your form's <code>method="POST"</code>) or <code>$_GET</code> (if it's <code>method="GET"</code>). If the form will involve changing anything, naturally you'd use <code>POST</code> for that.</p>
