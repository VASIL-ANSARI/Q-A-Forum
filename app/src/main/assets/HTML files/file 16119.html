<p>Absolutely. You can create a module which will return a base http server which implements the settings / methods that are common to all of your services. From there you can just require that module, and add additional service methods do it.</p>

<p>The module would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>var express = require('express');
var app = express.createServer();

//  Configure

//  Common Functionality
app.error(function(err, req, res, next){
    ...
});

exports.app = app;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can use this module like so:</p>

<pre><code>var service = require('./service-base').app;

service.get('/users', function(req, res) {
    //  get and return users
});

service.listen(1234);
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to expose other items from the module you can easily do that to make them available in the service implementation files as well.</p>
