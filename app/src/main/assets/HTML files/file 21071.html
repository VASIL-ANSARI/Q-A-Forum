<p>You don't need to write getwritable database again and again just make a constructor of db class <code>public DBCustomer open() throws SQLException
        {
        db = DBHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        return this;
        }</code>
and call all the function of db just decalring object and calling object.open function</p>
