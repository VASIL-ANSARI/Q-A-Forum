<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe Stream is just an interface and all kinds of collections are required to implement these operations specified in this interface?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Thats it.</strong> To be correct: A collection must implement a method <code>stream</code> that must be implemented as you explained.</p>

<p>Yet the <code>Stream</code> interface provides some default methods. Some stream providers do their own storage, e.g. collections. Others do not need storage, e.g. natural number providers, random number providers.</p>
