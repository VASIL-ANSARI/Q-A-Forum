<pre><code>if ($source) { // will checking like this add a re-load?
</code></pre>

<p>No it wont.. 
And since file_get_contents returns false on failure, its a fine way of testing, except a page containg only space, 0 or is blank, will also be deemed a failure. This may not be what you want. </p>

<pre><code>if ($source !== false) {
</code></pre>
