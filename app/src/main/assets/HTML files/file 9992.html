<p>Why are you passing the list as a HashMap instead of an actual List? If all you want to do is include a list of values in the report and it's all Strings, you could just build a comma-delimited list and pass it to the jrxml file as 1 String object. </p>

<p>If you have a list of data that needs to be associated with each individual data object, you can create a subreport that takes an ArrayList datasource with your list of things to print, and then include it in the main report.</p>
