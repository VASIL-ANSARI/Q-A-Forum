<p>If you return the pointer without copying you have to decide who owns the pointer. The one who owns it is responsible for deleting it when it is no longer needed. This can be a very hard problem, especially if your code gets more complex. Copy-semantics are much simpler to reason about.</p>

<p>In your specific example, the first thing to change would be to use <code>std::string</code> instead of <code>const char *</code> to represent strings. If you return an <code>std::string</code> by value, it will take care of the copying for you.</p>

<p>If you really want to prevent the copy, but still manage the lifetime elegantly, you should consider using an <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;</code> (or <code>boost::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;</code> if you don't have a C++11-compiler). A <code>shared_ptr</code> uses reference-counting to determine when the object it points to should be released, thus taking the burden of manual memory management from you, which is a Good Idea.</p>
