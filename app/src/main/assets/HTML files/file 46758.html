<p>OK...</p>

<p>The problem was that the validation helper validates the contents of the row within the table before saving. For this to trigger I needed to assign the ":terms" value to the model for validation.</p>

<p>I was only passing the params hash with the "terms" item within it expecting that to be validated.</p>
