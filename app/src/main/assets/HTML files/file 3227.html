<p>Create an instance of your class: <code>m = MyClass()</code></p>

<p>then use <code>m.f()</code> to call the function</p>

<p>Now you may wonder why you don't have to pass a parameter to the function (the 'self' param). It is because the instance on which you call the function is actually passed as the first parameter.</p>

<p>That is, <code>MyClass.f(m)</code> equals <code>m.f()</code>, where <code>m</code> is an instance object of class <code>MyClass</code>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
