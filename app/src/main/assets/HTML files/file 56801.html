<p>Most Probably you haven't enrolled to iOS developer program. You might have created a apple developer account, which will enable you to download tools required for development but in order to install app in devices and release the app in App Store, you will have to enroll to one of the iOS developer program. It's not free, you will have to pay 99$ for it. Once you do it, you will see the options to create AppID and Provisions profiles etc.</p>
