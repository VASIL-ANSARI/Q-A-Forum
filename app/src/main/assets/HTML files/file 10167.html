<p>From the <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/6.0.0api/javax/microedition/io/Connector.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> on Connector:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wi-Fi Support</strong></p>
  
  <p>Wi-Fi connection can be established by setting the interface parameter. This only works with direct TCP/UDP connections. </p>
  
  <p><strong>interface</strong>:    If the <code>interface=wifi</code> parameter is appended to the end of the URI string value, a Wi-Fi socket connection is opened. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that you'll have to detect if the radio is off, and if it is you can attempt to use Wi-Fi by adding <code>interface=wifi</code> to the URL. A proper URL would be: <code>http://www.google.com;interface=wifi</code></p>
