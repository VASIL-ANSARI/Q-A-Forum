<p>If the types are the same (they're both called <code>UserAlert</code> after all...), then do you need the <code>.Select()</code> clause at all?  Try:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;UserAlerts&gt; userAlerts = await db.UserAlerts
                                      .Where(x =&gt; x.UserID == UserID)
                                      .ToListAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>If the types are in fact different, then you can materialize the collection first before transforming it:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;UserAlerts&gt; userAlerts = await db.UserAlerts
                                      .Where(x =&gt; x.UserID == UserID)
                                      .ToListAsync()
                                      .Select(x =&gt; new UserAlerts
                                          {
                                              Lat = x.Lat,
                                              Lon = x.Lon,
                                              TimeTriggered = x.TimeTriggered,
                                              TimeEnded = x.TimeEnded,
                                              UserID = x.UserID
                                          })
                                      .ToListAsync();;
</code></pre>

<p>This would incur a performance hit if what you're materializing is considerably more data than what you're transforming it into, so be careful.</p>
