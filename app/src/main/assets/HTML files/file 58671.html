<p>I'm not sure that it will work for you, because I still don't understand the relationship between view models and models in your architecure, but try to use this idea:</p>

<p>1). My Window1's xaml has following content :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;       
    &lt;Frame Panel.ZIndex="1"
           x:Name="MainFrame"
           JournalOwnership="OwnsJournal"
           NavigationUIVisibility="Hidden"
           Source="UserControl1.xaml" /&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) UserControl1 has definition of DataContext:</p>

<pre><code> public UserControl1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        DataContext = new MainViewModel();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>3). The code where I extract and modfy the DataContext of the Content of my Frame:</p>

<pre><code>   Window1 window = new Window1();
        //window.Content = uc;


        var aa = window.Content as Grid;

        foreach (var e in aa.Children)
        {
            if (e is Frame)
            {
                Frame f = e as Frame;
                f.ContentRendered += F_ContentRendered;
            }
        }

//only inside of handler of ContentRendered event you can access to the content of your Frame:
  private void F_ContentRendered(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var frame = sender as Frame;
        UserControl1 uc1 = frame.Content as UserControl1;
        MainViewModel mvm = uc1.DataContext as MainViewModel;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>It should work.</p>
