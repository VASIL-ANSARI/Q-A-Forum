<p>I don't think that there is an API for that. I think (or rather, the voices <s>in my head</s> on the internet say) "Empty Trash" is a map to <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/empty-ubuntu-gnome-trash-from-the-command-line.html" rel="nofollow"><code>rm -rf ~/.Trash/*</code></a>. (Actually, that should be true for both KDE and Gnome, but I don't know about XFCE, Slim or XKCD. Of course, if you have XKCD as a windows manager, I don't think you'll ever need to worry about trash.)</p>
