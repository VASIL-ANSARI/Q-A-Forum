<p>The network topology usually does not allow real push notifications. Certainly a browser won't. What you <em>can</em> do is using a special kind of polling strategy that comes close: "long polls". </p>

<p>Basically these are ajax based poll requests that are <em>not</em> immediately answered by the server. The server only sends an answer when some event is available or a defined timeout is reached. In that case the poll will be instantiated again right away by the client. In the mean time the socket stays open, the request does not consume any resources. In effect this allows push notifications. </p>

<p>Also obviously google will spit out tons of hits if you search for "php long poll". </p>
