<p>You need to set the display of the tooltip to <a href="http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/hide/#fixed" rel="nofollow">fixed</a> mode and add a bit of a hide <a href="http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/hide/#delay" rel="nofollow">delay</a> as noted in the documentation so that it doesn't hide while the mouse is "in transit" to the tooltip.</p>

<p>You didn't specify which version you're using, but I'll assume qTip2:</p>

<pre><code>$('.selector').qtip({
    hide: {
        fixed: true,
        delay: 300
    }
});
</code></pre>
