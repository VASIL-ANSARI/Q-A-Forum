<p>You should really be using the csv module, but I can give some advice anyway.</p>

<p>One problem you're having is that when you say <code>print elmCellSize[0:10]</code>, you are always taking the first 10 elements, not the most recent 10 elements.  Depending on how you want to do this, you could keep a string to remember the most recent 10 elements.  I'll show an example below, after mentioning a few things that you can fix with your code.</p>

<p>First note that <code>line.split(',')</code> returns a list.  So your choice of variable name <code>elmCellSize</code> is a little misleading.  If you were to say <code>lineList = line.split(',')</code> it might make more sense?  Or if you were to say <code>lineSize = len(line.split(','))</code> and use that?</p>

<p>Also (although I don't know anything about Python 2.x) I think <code>xrange</code> is a function for Python 2.x which is more efficient than <code>range</code>, although it works exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Instead of saying <code>if (newrow/10) == int(newrow/10)</code>, you can actually say <code>if index % 10 == 0</code>, to check if index is a multiple of 10.  <code>%</code> can be thought of as 'remainder', so it will give the remainder of <code>newrow</code> when divided by <code>10</code>.  (Ex: 5 % 10 = 5; 17 % 10 = 7; 30 % 10 = 0)</p>

<p>Now instead of printing <code>[0:10]</code>, which will always print the first 10 elements, you want to print from the current index back 10 spaces.  So you can say <code>print lineList[index-10:index]</code> in order to print the most recent 10 elements.</p>

<p>In the end you'll have something like</p>

<pre><code>...
lineList = line.split(',') # Really, you should use csv reader
# Open the file to write to
with open('yourfile.ext', 'w') as f:
    # iterate through the line
    for index, value in enumerate(lineList):
        if index % 10 == 0 and index != 0:
            # Write the last 10 values to the file, separated by commas
            f.write(','.join(lineList[index-10:index]))
            # new line
            f.write('\n')
            # print
            print lineList[index-10:index]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm certainly not an expert, but I hope this helps!</p>
