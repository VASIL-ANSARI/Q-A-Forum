<p>If you add any additional data to image data your image will get corrupt. If you are outputting an image you better not to echo anything other than the image. The only way around might be writing whatever you want to write on the image. You can use GD functions to do that. There is another way that I might advice not to, you may add whatever you like to end of the image without getting an error. But thats not guaranteed.</p>

<p>PS: You can still run more code than that apart from echo'ing on the screen.</p>
