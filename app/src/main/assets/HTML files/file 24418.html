<p>To open a command window and execute a command  in it you need to add this to the arguments</p>

<pre><code>startInfo.Arguments = "/C schtasks /create /tn Inc-Andro-BU /tr" +         
                       inbackpath + "/sc minute /mo 10 /ru SYSTEM";
</code></pre>

<p>The /C flags is needed to pass the argument at the CMD. Otherwise the shell will exit immediately without waiting to execute your command - See CMD.EXE /? on a command window</p>
