<p>Couple of things:</p>

<p>1.) Yes, you can create the views using some client BUT perhaps the owner of the tables is not the owner of the view, which leads to </p>

<p>2.) Usually, doing backups of views in mysql includes some "useless garbage" like</p>

<pre><code>create algorithm xxx definer=&lt;USER&gt; sql security view &lt;view_name&gt; as ....
</code></pre>

<p>and that user often includes the IP or machine name the user logged on when creating the view... SO, the view won't create properly. Check that out, might help you.</p>
