<p>1000 lock operations per second are absolutely nothing. This will consume almost no time at all.</p>

  <p>my colleague has already tried using locks and lists and he deemed it too slow</p>

<p>In all likelihood this means that the locked region was too big. My guess is it went something like that:</p>

<pre><code>lock (...) {
 var item = TakeFromQueue();
 Process(item);
 DeleteFromQueue(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work because <code>Process</code> is too slow. It must be:</p>

<pre><code>lock (...)
 var item = TakeFromQueue();

 Process(item);

lock (...)
 DeleteFromQueue(item);
</code></pre>

<p>You will not have any perf problems with that at all.</p>

<p>You can now pick any data structure that you like. You are no longer bound by the capabilities of the built-in concurrent data structures. Besides picking a data structure that you like you also can perform any operation on it that you like such as taking multiple items atomically.</p>

<p>I have not fully understood your needs but it sounds like <code>SortedList</code> might go in the right direction.</p>
