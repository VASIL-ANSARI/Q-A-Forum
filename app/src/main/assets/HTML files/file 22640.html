<p>If you check your fiddle with the inspector you can see that after the JS is initiated there is no data-attr anymore on the image. The problem is all the background stuff you are doing. Not sure how maximage works but it seems that </p>

<p><code>background-size</code>(or if you dont use that doesnt matter) converts the image to a background image inside a .mc-image div. data-href is added to the div as well (which allows you to click it).
if you now use </p>

<pre><code>cssBackgroundSize: false, // We don't want to use background-size:cover for our custom size
</code></pre>

<p>the background image div is converted to an image again and the data-attr is removed.</p>

<p>So either dont use cssBackgroundSize:false and make the div .mc-image clickable (by just removing the children on the data-href call) or take another way around</p>
