<p>You can initialize a reference, but not assign to it, so you need to use the member initializer list for this. It's good habit to use it instead of assignment in constructors anyway as it can be more efficient.</p>

<pre><code>StripManager::StripManager(Strip &amp;stripToManage) : managedStrip (stripToManage)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that having a reference member makes <code>StripManager</code> non-assignable (<code>StripManager a(strip1), b(strip2); a = b;</code> won't compile unless you write a custom assignment operator; even then, since you can't assign references, it's unclear what the semantics should be), which may or may not be a problem depending on your particular situation.</p>
