<p>The <code>arg2</code> is NOT the ID of your item, take a look at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.OnItemLongClickListener.html" rel="nofollow">the official documentation</a> to understand what it is !</p>

<p>The <code>arg3</code> is NOT the ID of your item in the database, but the row ID of the Android ressource (i.e. R.id.xxx), so you can't just use the data given by the parameters of <code>onItemLongClick()</code>.</p>

<p>Knowing this, you can figure out that the line <code>helper.deleteName((arg2+1));</code> is not correct and doesn't mean anything : <code>arg2+1</code> means absolutely nothing for your database.</p>

<p>A solution (not the best I think), should be to include an <strong>invisible</strong> field in your item view, storing the actual <code>_id</code> field of your database. Then, when a long press is detected, you get back this value and pass it to <code>helper.deleteName()</code>.</p>
