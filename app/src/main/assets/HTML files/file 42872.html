<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sets module provides classes for constructing and manipulating <strong>unordered</strong> collections of unique elements. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing standard math operations on sets such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.</p>
