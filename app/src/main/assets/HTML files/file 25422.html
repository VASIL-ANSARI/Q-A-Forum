<p>You need to avoid such queries in big tables. It can cause mysql crash or server dump. And thats not yii problem.
Advices:</p>

<p>1.Use indexes (but carefully sometimes they slowing down queries - COUNT for example).</p>

<p>2.Always make limits in your queries :  <code>SELECT * FROM thistable LIMIT 50</code>.</p>

<p>3.If you using InnoDB for total count use <code>EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM thistable</code>. In myISAM <code>COUNT()</code> works fast.</p>

<p>4.Avoid all joins. Even join on small table(&lt;100 records) can cause 30-100% slow on queries.</p>

<p>I assume that 2nd point is your problem. 
For example: </p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM thistable LIMIT 30</code> => result (32,415,735 all, Query took 0.0184 sec.)`</p>

<p><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM thistable'=&gt; result (31,912,535 all, Query took 215.14 sec.)</code></p>
