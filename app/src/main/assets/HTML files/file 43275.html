<p>It was invalid implementation in generator. It returned null when class was generated already and because of it the proper version were used on some permutations only</p>

<pre><code>public String generate(TreeLogger logger, .....) ...{
    String className = null;
    if (printWriter != null) {
        SourceWriter writer = composer.createSourceWriter(ctx, printWriter);
        ....
        className = composer.getCreatedClassName();
    }
    return className;
}
</code></pre>

<p>when I changed </p>

<pre><code>    String className = packageName + "." + simpleName;
</code></pre>

<p>It started to work as expected.</p>
