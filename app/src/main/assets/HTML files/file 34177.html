<p>Having category_id and post_id as a compound primary key will have better performance than having an extra id as a primary key. This is because making it a primary key will also create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index" rel="nofollow">index</a> on it automatically. If you really want an extra Id column you can improve performance by manually defining an index on category_id and post_id. There is no benefit of having an extra key column though and this is generally a bad practice.</p>
