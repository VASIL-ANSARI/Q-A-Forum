<p>I'm really curious why you are changing the locale manually since it can be driven automatically from device settings, but let's pretend you have done it intentionally :)</p>

<p>What you need to do - is just call <code>setContentView(R.layout.main);</code>. Activity will update UI automatically based on locale settings.</p>

<p>The tricky point here - is that if you have some dynamic data (such as references to buttons, text views, etc), you might need to update your references as well, since old ones will not be relevant any longer.</p>
