<p>I haven't got rid of the java error, but I found out why I was getting a white screen on the .swf!  </p>

<p>It was a stack trace error. </p>

<p>I got rid of this error by adding compiler argument:</p>

<pre><code>-omit-trace-statements=false
</code></pre>

<p>Now my .swf runs fine!  </p>

<p>Still don't know what is causing the java ZipException, looks like a problem with one of the .png graphics files, but I can't see a problem in the .swf.</p>

<p>Because of the ZipException the project won't compile in Flash Develop, so I am left with using mxmlc.</p>
