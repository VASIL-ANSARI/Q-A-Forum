<p>The HTML form urlencodes the file name to %2500 and PHP decodes it again to %00 (percent sign, zero, zero). There is no null byte in your test anywhere, you'd have to name the file with an actual null byte (not possible) or fiddle with the HTTP request manually instead of using the HTML form. Still, current PHP versions are <strong>not</strong> vulnerable to this attack, PHP internally boxes variables in a so called ZVal container and allows null bytes in the middle of a string without any effect.</p>
