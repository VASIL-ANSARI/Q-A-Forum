<p>Don't confuse <code>#include</code>, <code>using</code> and <code>#using</code>. </p>

<p><code>#using</code> is used to import class libraries in C++/CLI, which is something you won't ever need unless you work with .NET libraries (but then usually you are better off just using C#, unless you are writing interop code). </p>

<p><code>#include</code> is for including header files, which is what you normally do in "regular" C++. <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> is a regular standard library header, so you need <code>#include</code> (as in <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><code>using</code> instead is used to bring names in the current scope (either the whole content of a namespace - as in the dreaded <code>using namespace std;</code>) or single names (as in <code>using std::cout;</code>). From C++11 it's also used to enable constructors inheritance and to create type aliases, but for the moment I don't think you need to worry about these uses. </p>

<p>But most importantly: please take the time to <em>first</em> learn the basics of the language from reputable sources before trying random stuff. All this <code>#using</code> mess wouldn't have arisen if you even just looked first at the classic hello would example you can find everywhere on the Internet. </p>
