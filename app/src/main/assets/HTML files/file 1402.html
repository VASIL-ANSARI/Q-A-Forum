<p>When you say:</p>

<pre><code>typedef boost::intrusive_ptr&lt;T&gt; Pointer;
</code></pre>

<p>you are declaring a type which is an intrusive pointer to an <code>int</code> (because <code>T</code> is an <code>int</code> at that point), when the template is instantiated in your code. Your SharedObject class is not an <code>int</code>, so you can't instantiate such an intrusive pointer using <code>this</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> OK, I misunderstood your code,  I'll try again. At:</p>

<pre><code>return Pointer(this); //Ambiguous call here
</code></pre>

<p>this is a SharedObject , as per the error messages, however the pointer is typedefed to a SomeClass I think.  </p>

<p>Your code is incredibly hard to understand  - whatever it is you are trying to do, there must be a simpler way. And you seem to be missing a virtual destructor (and maybe a virtual function) in the base class.</p>
