<p>Seems like you're missing your [onreadystatechange]</p>

<p>When you send an Ajax request, you need to listen for the state change.</p>

<p>Your code is asynchronous, hence listening for state change is required.
xml.open("GET", "setverfile.txt",true); // The true parametter is for async</p>

<p>If you did
xml.open("GET", "setverfile.txt",false); // The false parametter is for non async.</p>

<p>Then your code should work.</p>
