<p>we had very similar problem. What helped for us is to add <code>-lgnustl_static</code> at the end of the  LOCAL_LDLIBS line in Android.mk. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_LDIBS := -lboost_system .... -lgnustl_static
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is because boost libraries depend on STL but don't have it statically compiled in, so it needs to be mentioned explicitly like that. </p>

<p>Also, it seems you don't have to add the <code>APP_STL := gnustl_static</code> line to the <code>Application.mk</code>.</p>
