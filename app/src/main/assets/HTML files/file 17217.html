<p>By default Asynctask uses a serial executor, so a single thread is used to execute all the asynctasks in a single process. But you can change it.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">doc</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting HONEYCOMB, tasks are back to being executed on a single
  thread to avoid common application errors caused by parallel
  execution. If you truly want parallel execution, you can use the
  executeOnExecutor(Executor, Params...) version of this method with
  THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR;</p>
