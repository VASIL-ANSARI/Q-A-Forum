<p>If you're not dealing with a huge XML file, consider DOM parsers for your purpose. I would suggest that you look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilder.html" rel="nofollow">DocumentBuilder</a> class for this purpose. You would actually need to call the different <code>parse()</code> methods (<em>your source can be a file or any other InputSource</em>)</p>
