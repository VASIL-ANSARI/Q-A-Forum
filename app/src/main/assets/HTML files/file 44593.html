<p>Yes, Elasticsearch does not have auto-increment feature for any field. See <a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Auto-incremental-property-td2693582.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>. As you've correctly mentioned, this has to be implemented on the client side (Client of Elasticsearch cluster) by incrementing some static integer.</p>
