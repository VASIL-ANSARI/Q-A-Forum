<p>The answer is in my own inability to test fully. I had an issue with the html in the message of the email I was sending. This must have been throwing up and error and then the PHP failed on the while loop.</p>

<p>Error in the HTML fixed (it was an un-escaped double quote) and everything is sending fine with no errors.</p>
