<p>From your comments, the reason this isnt working is that the result of (On_Hand*price) is erroneous (you are multiplying a number with a string)</p>

<p>On the other hand, if on_hand is an <code>int</code> and price is a <code>decimal/double/float</code> then you can get the correct result by using the following:</p>

<pre><code>CONCAT('$',convert(ON_HAND*PRICE,char))
</code></pre>

<p>if PRICE is a <code>varchar</code> i would strongly suggest to store it as a <code>decimal</code> before continuing. This problem you are experiencing is just the start of headaches you will have if you store prices as <code>varchar</code>s.</p>

<p>if this is not possible, then you can look at the Cast() function to first cast your <code>varchar</code> as a <code>decimal</code> or <code>float</code> before performing the multiplication.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>MySQL appears to be smart enough to convert varchars to floats itself, however it WONT work when there is a '$' sign in the varchar field.</p>

<p>So maybe try doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>CONCAT('$',convert(ON_HAND*Right(PRICE,Length(Price)-1),char))
</code></pre>
