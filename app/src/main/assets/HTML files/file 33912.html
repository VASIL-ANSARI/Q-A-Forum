<p>Try disabling the schema consistency. This is one time thing that needs to happen when you upgrade asp.net identity from version 1.0 to 2.0.</p>

<pre><code>public ApplicationDbContext() : base("MyConnection", throwIfV1Schema:false)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice I added <code>throwIfV1Schema:false</code> as a second parameter. Compile it, try to log in so the DB gets updated, do the migrations if needed and then you can remove it.</p>
