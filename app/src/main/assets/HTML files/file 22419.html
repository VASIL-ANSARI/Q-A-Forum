<p>check your android AndroidManifest.xml file carefully, there may be something wrong like you have given the wrong permission or added one permission twice. If not then add this user permission to your file </p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also check if you have specified the launcher correctly in menifest file </p>
