<p>If you right click on your project and click "Open Module Settings" you should see a tab that says "Dependencies". After you click on the tab you should see a green plus button, clicking on it will give you 3 options. Select "Module Dependency" and from there you can add your jar. It should automatically update the gradle for you.</p>
