<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Although everyone and their mom is apparently riding the <a href="http://jquery.com/"><strong>jQuery</strong></a> bandwagon (I use <a href="http://www.mochikit.com"><strong>MochiKit</strong></a>), there are many libraries which provide the same functionality - the problem set which most libraries solve (async client-server communication, DOM manipulation, etc.) is the same, and there are few that don't have what you will need to get the job done. </p>

<p>The important thing to determine for yourself is whether or not a library will fit your particular style and sensibilities. Wide-spread ignorance about how <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>, the language, actually works, coupled with the negative press resulting thereby, coupled with the now-immense popularity of jQuery leads most people down that road. Thankfully, it isn't a bad road to be on as there are a lot of travellers to keep you company when the abstractions leak and you need help. You probably can't go wrong choosing jQuery.</p>
