<p>The problem is that <code>http://fileserver.com/images/123.jpg</code> is no Class Path Resource.</p>

<p>If you access the image from the file system then file access classes from <code>java.io</code> package.
If you really need to to access the files over http, then you need to download the file first.</p>

<pre><code>Url url = new URL("http://fileserver.com/images/123.jpg");
InputStream is = u.openStream();
...
</code></pre>
