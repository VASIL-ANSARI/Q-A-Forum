<p>It looks like there is a bug in the OpenGL ES 2 implementation. The hint was that when I changed <code>glDrawArrays(GL_POINTS, 0, 200000);</code> to <code>glDrawArrays(GL_LINES, 0, 200000);</code> there is no display problem on the device. The solution (found <a href="http://uncommoncode.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/gl_points-primitive-with-ios-opengl-es-2-0/">here</a>) for using <code>GL_POINTS</code> is to set <code>gl_PointSize = 1.0;</code> in the vertex shader.</p>

<p>EDIT: It's probably not a bug, see <a href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/manglsl/xhtml/gl_PointSize.xml">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The value of gl_PointSize (or the gl_PointSize member of the gl_out[] array, in the case of the tessellation control shader) is <strong>undefined</strong> after the vertex, tessellation control, and tessellation evaluation shading stages if the corresponding shader executable does not write to gl_PointSize.</p>
