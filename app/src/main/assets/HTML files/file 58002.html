<p>I notice you import BeautifulSoup, so you can use BeautifulSoup to help you extract these information.</p>

<pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(l,"html.parser")
print soup.get_text()
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried and it worked, but the sentence in the last tag will also be extracted, you have to cut the result if needed.</p>
