<p>If you're locking on a object stored as a <em>static</em> then the lock should work for all threads in the same Application Domain, but perhaps you need to upload a code sample so we can have a look at the offending lines.</p>

<p>That said, one thought would be to check if IIS is configured to run in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/57fd3d02-9b05-4b3f-8c3a-f326ff895ab8.mspx?mfr=true" rel="nofollow">Web Garden</a> mode (i.e. more than 1 process executing your application) which would break your locking logic. While you could fix such a situation with a mutex it'd be easier to reconfigure your application to execute in a single process, although you'd be wise to check the performance before and after messing with the web garden settings as it can potentially affect performance.</p>
