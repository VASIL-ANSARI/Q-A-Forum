<p>Stick to a standard timezone like <code>UTC</code> or <code>GMT</code> (or whatever you fancy the most) and tell your users their token will expire on <code>2014-08-07 13:36:45 UTC</code>.</p>

<p>You could also tell them how many minutes, hours or days the token will last instead of showing them a full date. It's always nicer to read <code>will last 45 minutes.</code> instead of <code>will last until 2014-08-07 13:36:45 UTC</code>. This way, no matter what timezone the user is, 45 minutes will always last 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Now, you can only guess the user's timezone by their IP address but it'll be just that, a guess. They could be behind a proxy, their ISP could not show you their real location, they could be behind a VPN, etc.</p>

<p>When it comes to dates you don't want to guess, you want to stick with a standard timezone.</p>
