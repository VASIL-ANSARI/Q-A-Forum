<p>As the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/?normalize=1&amp;text=*%5Btext%5D(url)*%0A%5B*text*%5D(url)%0A*%5Btext%5D*(url)%0A%5B*emphasised*+text%5D(url)" rel="nofollow">Babelmark</a> tool demonstrates, all but one of your examples works just fine in most Markdown parses. This appears to be a bug in the Markdown parser you are using. You might consider reporting it to the developers of that project.</p>

<p>Note that the one example you provided which does not work is this one:</p>

<pre><code>*[text]*(url)
</code></pre>

<p>That example should never work as the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link" rel="nofollow">rules</a> state the following (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses <strong>immediately</strong> after the link textâs closing square bracket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means not even a space should be allowed between the parts of the link, although some implementations do allow a single space. Certainly no other characters should be allowed.</p>

<p>However, each item can contain other nested items. For that reason, all of the following are correct:</p>

<pre><code>*[text](url)*
[*text*](url)
[*emphasised* text](url)
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible that the parser you are using has different behavior for the underscore character (<code>_</code>). According to the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em" rel="nofollow">rules</a>, those characters should be interchangeable. Nevertheless, as @user880772 mentioned in a comment, you might want to try using that character rather than an asterisk (<code>*</code>) to see if you can get the desired output as a workaround until the bug is fixed. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>_[text](url)_
[_text_](url)
[_emphasised_ text](url)
</code></pre>
