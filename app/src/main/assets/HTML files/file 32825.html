<p>The only thing controlling the order is the sort descriptor you have:</p>

<pre><code> NSSortDescriptor *firstSort = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"modified"
                                                           ascending:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>So you need to change that. You can make it ascending, but you describe a sort order which isn't directly linked to the date.</p>

<p>Because what you describe is dependent upon the current date you will need to make some modifications so that you have order information stored persistently into the model and which you update each day. You can then add this as your first your sort descriptor to use that, and keep the existing sort descriptor for ordering inside each section. </p>

<p>The information you need to store is as per the comment from @Volker, with a simple index number for each section.</p>
