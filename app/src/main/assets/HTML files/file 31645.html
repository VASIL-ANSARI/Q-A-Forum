<p>Did you actually create the table? It seems like the DATABASE_CREATE script is never executed.
If you have created it once and then changed the statement, make sure it is executed again by incrementing the database version.</p>

<p>DATABASE_VERSION=1, did you have a prior version without the NAME column? Try incrementing the DATABASE_VERSION (maybe add some logging/breakpoints) and see if the DB gets recreated.</p>
