<p>Your problem is your third RewriteRule:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ inner.php?path=$1 [QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>Autopsy:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>^</code> - <em>The string <strong>must</strong> start with the next match</em></li>
<li><code>([^\.]+)</code> - <em>Matches any character that isn't an <code>.</code> (which you need to escape as <code>.</code> in regex is "any character") 1 to infinity times (that's the <code>+</code>)</em></li>
<li><code>$</code> - <em>The string <strong>must</strong> end with the previous match</em></li>
</ul>

<p>..so your redirect in the bottom would only work if the URL had no <code>.</code> in it, eg. <code>/news/blabla/mysite.html</code>.</p>

<p>How to fix it? Just move it on top of the other rules so it tries to match it first. If your change is permanent, you should also change <code>R</code> to <code>R=301</code> to make sure that it sends a <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> instead of <code>302 Found</code> (which doesn't get cached).</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/news/(.*)$ about/news/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^$ inner.php?pathstring=/main/
RewriteRule ^(.+str=.*)$ inner.php?path=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ inner.php?path=$1 [QSA]
</code></pre>
