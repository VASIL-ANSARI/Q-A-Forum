<p>It's possible you have multiple python versions installed on your system. For example if you installed your python from source, and then again with apt-get. Apt-get will install to the default python version. Make sure you are being consistent. </p>

<p>Potentially using pip install setuptools could solve your problem.</p>

<p>Try these commands:</p>

<pre><code>$which python
/usr/bin/python
$python --version
Python 2.7.12
</code></pre>

<p>Making sure that the output matches your expectations.</p>

<p>It may be worth removing previous installations and starting over as this answer suggests:</p>
