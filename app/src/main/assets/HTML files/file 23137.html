<p>A destructor is a method which is automatically invoked when the object is destroyed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructor_%28computer_programming%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>It doesn't destroy objects, but starts working when they are destroyed. For it, you have to use something else.</p>
