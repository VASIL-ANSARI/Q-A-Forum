<p>To use the library, one needs to first build it. I could not manage to build the master branch. So, I decided to use the V0.4 instead. I built the solution in that branch using Visual Studio and it produced the dll and lib files. One can then import the .dll file by using Add_library to add it via Cmake. After Add_library, the include directories need to be added by include_directories command.</p>

<p>I need to generate .a and .so files in the end. I'm working in windows and could not find a way to generate these files, yet!</p>
