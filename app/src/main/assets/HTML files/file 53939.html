<p>This has to do with the change of Aurelia from <code>core-js</code> to home-grown polyfills. The Reflect polyfill is missing and tests fail to run.</p>

<p>This problem is addressed in Aurelia navigation skeleton app by the following import statement in each unit test file:</p>

<pre><code>import 'aurelia-polyfills';
</code></pre>

<p>I solved it by creating a <code>setup.ts</code> (or <code>setup.js</code> resp. to your language) file with just this statement, and then just listing it in <code>karma.config.js</code> at the first place.</p>

<p>for JS e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>jspm  : {
  loadFiles: ['test/unit/setup.js', 'test/unit/**/*.js'],
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>for Typescript e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>files: ['test/unit/setup.ts', 'test/unit/**/*.ts'],
...
</code></pre>
