<p>Following command from visual studio command line solves the problem </p>

<pre><code>Sgen.exe (locationOfTheDllFile)\MyServiceReferences.dll
</code></pre>

<p>But there is another following error occurs rarely (when attempting to load the page very very often)</p>

<pre><code>[System.AppDomainUnloadedException] = {"Attempted to access an unloaded appdomain. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131014)"}
</code></pre>
