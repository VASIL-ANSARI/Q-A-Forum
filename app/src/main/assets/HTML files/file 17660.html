<p>In the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/uiview_class/uiview/uiview.html" rel="nofollow">UIView</a> docs you can see <code>drawRect:</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the time this method is called, UIKit has configured the drawing environment appropriately for your view and you can simply call whatever drawing methods and functions you need to render your content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the drawing you do inside <code>drawRect:</code> is correct as the drawing context is setup correctly etc, this is not the case in your <code>makeRed</code> method.</p>

<p>I would suggest having an ivar <code>shadowColor</code> and then use this inside your <code>drawRect:</code> method. 
Your <code>makeRed</code> would then look like this</p>

<pre><code>- (void)makeRed;
{
  self.shadowColor = [UIColor redColor];
  [self setNeedsDisplay];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then modify the line in <code>drawRect:</code> to</p>

<pre><code>CGContextSetShadowWithColor(context, shadowOffset, shadowBlurRadius, self.shadowColor.CGColor);
</code></pre>

<p><code>setNeedsDisplay</code> is used to tell <code>UIKit</code> that you would like your view to be redrawn, which then results in <code>drawRect:</code> being called again.</p>

<p>You will of course have to initialize <code>_shadowColor = [UIColor blackColor]</code> in the <code>init*</code> method.</p>
