<p>Well first of all, as it's said in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> passing a code to <code>setTimeout</code> is strongly discouraged:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>code</em>: in the alternate syntax is a string of code you want to execute after delay milliseconds (using this syntax is not recommended for the same reasons as using eval())</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I would recommend calling functions using following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(checkAds, 25);
</code></pre>

<p>But, if you still want to use it like you do, you need to define these functions in <code>window</code> context, see <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/613n7xwp/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a>:</p>

<pre><code>window.checkAds = function() {
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It wasn't working because when interpreter dynamically wrapped your code in anonymous function, your functions were be undefined in new context.</p>
