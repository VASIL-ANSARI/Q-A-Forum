<p>You could use this class to do that <code>Windows.System.Display.DisplayRequest</code>:</p>

<pre><code>private Windows.System.Display.DisplayRequest _displayRequest;

public void ActivateDisplay()
{
    //create the request instance if needed
    if (_displayRequest == null)
        _displayRequest = new Windows.System.Display.DisplayRequest();

    //make request to put in active state
    _displayRequest.RequestActive();
}

public void ReleaseDisplay()
{
    //must be same instance, so quit if it doesn't exist
    if (_displayRequest == null)
        return;

    //undo the request
    _displayRequest.RequestRelease();
}
</code></pre>
