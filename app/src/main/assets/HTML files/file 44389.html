<blockquote>
  <p>With swift, isn't it possible to dump functions and variables into a file instead of implementing a singleton?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible. However, the same is possible in Objective-C, with the same pluses and minuses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a good reason (like memory management or something) that I am missing, other than style concerns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two considerations are relevant here:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can make your singleton polymorphic, expose an interface, define several implementations, and pick the specific one at runtime</li>
<li>You can "reset" your singleton by discarding the instance and creating a new one.</li>
<li>If you need concurrency, having a singleton makes it a little easier to implement.</li>
</ul>
