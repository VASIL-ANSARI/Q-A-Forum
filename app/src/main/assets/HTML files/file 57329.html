<p>One solution is to never hard delete any of the objects, but keep a boolean called "is_deleted" in your model. This way, you can count the number of deleted objects, and you can also count specific elements of the deleted objects. You might want to override the <code>delete()</code> fuction, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1534986/how-do-i-override-delete-on-a-model-and-have-it-still-work-with-related-delete">this SO question</a> on how to do this:</p>

<p>Downside is of course that you have to store the elements. Also, sometimes a delete should cascade. You can for instance use a library like <a href="https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-safedelete" rel="nofollow">django-safedelete</a> or <a href="https://github.com/scoursen/django-softdelete" rel="nofollow">django-softdelete</a></p>
