<p>ASP.NET actually generates a class descending from your page using the ASPX markup as a template of sorts. You can find the generated classes source code in the folders under %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\v[FRAMEWORK VERSION]\Temporary ASP.NET File.</p>

<p>My understanding is it generates a class which instantiates the control and wires the event handlers to whatever method applies. This is why things break badly when you, say, make your event handler private -- the descendant class can't access it.</p>

<p>The code generation is pretty expensive up-front; it is partially responsible for that lengthy asp.net warm-up most of us asp.net developers suffer through. But it is very, very efficient once the app gets warmed up as everything is rendering via compiled code.</p>
