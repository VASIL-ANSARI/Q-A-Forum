<p>I am experiencing the same problem.  I think something change in Comodo's timestamp service today. The response status for <a href="http://timestamp.comodoca.com" rel="nofollow">http://timestamp.comodoca.com</a> is currently 
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Content-Type: text/html</p>

<p>This causes a problem for jarsigner as it is expecting content-type to be application/timestamp-reply</p>

<p>You should contact Comodo support at <a href="https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/68/0/time-stamping-server" rel="nofollow">https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/68/0/time-stamping-server</a></p>
