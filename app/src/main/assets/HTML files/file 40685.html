<p>I think you should rethink this part:</p>

<pre><code>var mosquito = mosquitos[i];
setInterval (updateAnimation, 500);
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose you want every new 'updateAnimation' get a different mosquito (mosquitos[0], mosquitos[1] .. mosquitos[i]). But what really happens is something different. Every time you get the same mosquito (mosquitos[i]).
This is because of asynchronous behaviour of setInterval() function.</p>

<pre><code>function updateAnimation () {
  next();

  function next() {
           // every time, mosquito is equal to mosquitos[i]
           // and NOT mosquitos[0], then mosquitos[1] ...
           mosquito.state = mosquito.FLYINGRIGHT1;
           setTimeout (previous, 500);

          function previous()
                  {
                       mosquito.state = mosquito.FLYINGRIGHT;

                  }

      }
   }
</code></pre>
