<p>Don't overthink this.  A form is just an object.  From within Form1 you will create a new object of type Form2.  Form2 can have whatever properties (two ints in your case) that can be set however you wish.  Assuming you are using WinForms, you will probably want to show Form2 via ShowDialog() which is a blocking call.  When ShowDialog() returns, you can then interrogate Form2 (you still have a handle to the object in Form1) about any of its properties.</p>

<p>If this is not enough to get you started, I'm sure someone else will post an entire coded solution.</p>
