<p>Notice that your ranges are exactly 25 apart. If you perform integer division on y, you can use that to index into your count array. There is a special case for y=200 because that would return 8, which is outside of your array size.</p>

<pre><code>if (y &gt;=0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 200)
    ++count[y/25];
else if (y == 200)
    ++count[7];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>As Richard Hodges states in his comment, a shorter, more idiomatic way of writing this would be just:</p>

<pre><code>++count[ std::min(7, y/25) ];
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to include the algorithm header to access this function.</p>
