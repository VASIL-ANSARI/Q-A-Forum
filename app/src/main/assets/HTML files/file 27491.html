<pre><code>self.connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:self.req delegate:self];
</code></pre>

<p>returns immediately because it starts an async operation. You need to parse the data when <code>connectionDidFinishLoading:</code> is called.</p>

<p>Or consider using:</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)sendAsynchronousRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request queue:(NSOperationQueue *)queue completionHandler:(void (^)(NSURLResponse*, NSData*, NSError*))handler
</code></pre>

<p>The completion block will be called when the http operations is complete. Process the data in the completion block and notify any object that needs the data. This is probably a good bet if you do not need the other delegate methods.</p>
