<p>If you need to support only ASCII or ISO-8859-1 then a simple array of widths indexed by the binary character value would be a better choice. If you need to support Unicode then a Map is better since an array would be quite large and sparse (i.e. mostly empty).</p>

<p>Give the 112 pixel width, you must be writing this for an embedded display, so you probably don't care about hyphenation, splitting on syllables, and such niceties.  Depending on how many lines your display has you might want to consider setting a minimum threshold for splitting a word, say 25% of its width.  I.e. if you can't get at least 25% of the letters on the line, break the entire word to the next line and leave whitespace at the end of the previous line.  But that's an aesthetic decision that may not be a consideration given the limited space.</p>
