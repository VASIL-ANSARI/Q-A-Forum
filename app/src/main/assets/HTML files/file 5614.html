<p>As long as you have a column where you keep track of the raw days where a user has visited the site, you can write a query to look for <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/t-sql-programming/find-missing-date-ranges-in-sql/" rel="nofollow">gaps in the data</a>. A specific query would be pretty lengthy to put in here (no doubt someone smarter than me will come up with a short example that proves me wrong), but it's very possible, just a little bit time consuming to write the code to detect.</p>
