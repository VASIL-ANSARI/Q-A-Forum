<p>The first two lines should be valid C++, assuming you've included stdlib.h, and have defined Tree as a class/struct/type somewhere.</p>

<p>The third line will need to be changed, since 'delete' is a keyword in C++ and can't be used as a function name.  Try doing a global replace in the C code and changing all instances of 'delete' with 'delete_from_tree' or something like that.</p>
