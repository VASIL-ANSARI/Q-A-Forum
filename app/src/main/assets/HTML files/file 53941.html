<p>what does <code>GetTodaysMonthAndYear</code> do?  More specifically, when is <code>MonthPickertext.text</code> set?  It looks like this isn't defined during <code>viewDidLoad</code> which means that your <code>resultSet</code> will not be defined.</p>

<p>When you access this function from a button - after the view has fully loaded and everything has been populated, then it will all work.</p>

<p>To make this work within <code>viewDidLoad</code> - try accessing the data that you're going to put into the date fields, rather than the contents of the field</p>
