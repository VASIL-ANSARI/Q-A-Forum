<li><p>Any <code>ArrayList</code> can hold not much than 2<sup>31</sup>-1 elements, due to <code>int</code> typed index of inner array.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an approach called <code>in memory Db</code> which implies that you hold a lot of data in memory for gain fast access to it. But this approach also implies, that:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. you have a lot of memory, available for holding all necessary data (it could be several tens of gigabytes);</p>

<p>b. you db implements compact form of data storage. It means that db will not contain ready java-objects, but fragments of byte-array data, from which you will contstruct objects on demand.</p>

<p>So, you need to reckon, how much memory you will need for all data that you want to load into memory and decide whether this approach eligible or not.</p>
