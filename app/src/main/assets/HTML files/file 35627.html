<p>You have not thought of the case when there is only <em>one</em> child. Make sure your program works right on these two trees, too - one is a min heap, the other is a max heap:</p>

<pre><code>  2     1
 /     /
1     2
</code></pre>

<p>Also learn to set brackets correctly; you have made the classic mistake <code>True and 42 == 42</code>; which is <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Consider handling the two maybe-nonexistant childs the same way.</p>

<pre><code>if left is not None:
  if not &lt;check max heap property for left subtree&gt;: return False
if right is not None:
  if not &lt;check max heap property for right subtree&gt;: return False
return True
</code></pre>

<p>The missing function should compare to the current node <em>and</em> recurse into the subtree if necessary.</p>
