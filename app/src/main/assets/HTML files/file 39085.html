<p>I use Watir and I don't really know C# but since no one else has answered...</p>

<p>In the first example you are defining the 'ie' variable as <code>IE("http://www.example.org")</code>
and then on line 3 you are simply referencing the original 'ie' variable.
So the 'ie' variable still has the value that you gave it in line 1.</p>

<p>In the second example you define 'ie' to equal the first url.
Then on line 3 you are changing the value of 'ie' to the 2nd url.</p>

<p>The console is not printing out the url that your browser is currently on, it is simply printing out the value of 'ie' as you have set it in the code because you are including the uri as part of the value of 'ie'.</p>

<p>If you are gonna 'set' the url in the 'var' you might want to name it something more descriptive to its value, like below:</p>

<pre><code>var ie_example = new IE("http://www.example.org");
Console.WriteLine(ie_example.LocationURL.ToString()); // example.org
ie_example.Close();
var ie_example2 = new IE("http://www.example2.org");
Console.WriteLine(ie_example2.LocationURL.ToString()); // example2.org
</code></pre>
