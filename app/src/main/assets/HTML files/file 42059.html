<p>Cloudhub properties are set using System Properties, thats why you can access them via System.getProperty().</p>

<p>mule-app.properties is special as this properties file automatically gets loaded into the Mule registry so you could access it via the Mule Context. But it would be better to inject them into you Java class from your Mule config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean class="YourJavaClass"&gt;
  &lt;property name="myVar" value="${the.key}"&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

public class YourJavaClass{
   String myVar ...
}
</code></pre>
