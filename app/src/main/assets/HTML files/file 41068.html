<p>The 'read more' links point towards the url for that particular post; changing the destination doesn't make much sense given the context. It sounds like your issue isn't so much about changing the destination of the link <em>per se</em>, rather you need to change the design of the page that it actually links to. If that's the case you should look at either <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates" rel="nofollow">page templates</a> if the destination is a page, or <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Type_Templates" rel="nofollow">custom post types</a> if it's a type of post. </p>

<p>Looking at some of your other questions I gather that you're new to WordPress. Here's a brief summary of how your example is working so that you can hopefully form a better understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>WordPress primarily uses <em>posts:</em> these are specific entries for your site. Depending on the nature of the site, they can be blog posts, reviews, news articles, anything really. Just remember that each post is it's own particular <em>thing</em> inside WordPress</li>
<li>The way a post <em>looks</em> is determined by the <em>template</em> that is used.</li>
<li>The bit of code that you posted is a <em>loop</em>; that one in particular is taking the content of  the variable <code>$query</code> (which in your example contains three posts) and then <em>for each</em> post runs all the functions in between the <code>{}</code> brackets. This is why you end up with three posts/images/links; the function runs three times, once for every post it finds inside of <code>$query</code></li>
<li>Inside the <code>{}</code> brackets, <code>$post</code> refers to that particular post. <code>$post-&gt;ID</code> returns the unique ID number for that post.</li>
<li>The <code>get_the_excerpt()</code> function fetches the excerpt (a short bit of content) for that particular post. You pass it <code>$post-&gt;ID</code>, so that it fetches the excerpt for the correct post.</li>
<li>The <code>post_permalink()</code> function is what figures out what the url to that particular post. Again, in your example you're passing it <code>$post-&gt;ID</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You should read up on <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/the-wordpress-loop-explained-for-beginners" rel="nofollow">The Loop</a>; it forms the basis of how WordPress works. If you can get your head around that you're halfway there.</p>
