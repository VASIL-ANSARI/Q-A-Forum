<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ba0a1yw2.aspx" rel="nofollow">default accessibility</a> of an inner class is <code>private</code>.</p>

<p>Change it to <code>public</code> or <code>internal</code> to gain access outside the encompassing class.</p>

<hr>

<p>An unrelated issue in your code is that you are declaring members with the same name - <code>Resolution</code> and <code>Graphics</code> are both class names and other members (property and field, respectively).</p>
