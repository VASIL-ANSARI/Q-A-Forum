<p>It sounds like you are using multiple threads and that each thread has to be able to access two separate database connections.</p>

<p>The usual way to deal with this is not to write your own code, but to use connection pooling: an underlying set of actual database sockets are managed by some code and you just get lightweight references to them that can be closed and returned to the pool. Two java packages that I would recommend for this are <a href="http://jolbox.com/" rel="nofollow">BoneCP</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0/" rel="nofollow">C3P0</a>. You would then create a pool of connections for database 1 and database 2.</p>

<p>This way, each thread need only request a connection from pool 1 or pool 2 (depending on the database it needs), do whatever it wants to do, and then <code>close()</code> the connection when done. The pool will automatically create a number of actual sockets depending on load and will manage all the synchronization between threads for you.</p>
