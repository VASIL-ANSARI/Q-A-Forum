<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tabh47cf%28v=vs.80%29.aspx">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid ambiguous results when strings in separator have characters
  in common, the Split operation proceeds from the beginning to the end
  of the value of the instance, and matches the first element in
  separator that is equal to a delimiter in the instance. The order in
  which substrings are encountered in the instance takes precedence over
  the order of elements in separator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for the first case ".." and "..." are found on the same position and their order in separator is used to determine the used one. For the second case, ".x" is found before "x." and the order of elements in separator does not apply.</p>
