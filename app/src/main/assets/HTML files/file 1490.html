<p>The built-in Date object will allow you to format the date in the format defined by the user's system - this may or may not include AM/PM (it may not be in English either). You can format it yourself, of course, using something like <a href="http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/html/formatting_time_using_javascript.php3" rel="nofollow">this</a>. For complete control, use a <a href="http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/" rel="nofollow"><code>strftime()</code></a> library.</p>
