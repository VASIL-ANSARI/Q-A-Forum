<p>The only thing you need to modify in your code is this part in line 17 of your HTML  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input data-bind="value: price" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>into </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input data-bind="value: $data.row().price"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you bind the 'price' initially, you were binding it to the price attribute of RowReservation object. When the 'row' value changed, the value of 'price' attribute was not updated. Therefore it still shows the original price. </p>

<p>I changed the binding so that it is showing the price attribute of 'row'. So when 'row' is changed by selecting different item in the combobox, the price is updated to the price of the newly selected row.</p>

<p>Basically you have</p>

<pre><code>// RowReservationObject

{'row': 
    {'rowName': 'Standard',
     'rowID': 1, 
    'price': 19.99 },   // --&gt; this is what I'm binding against now
'rowID': 1 
'price': 19.99}  // -- this is what you were binding against before
</code></pre>

<p>If you change the variable names a bit it might become clearer to you.
I hope I'm making sense.</p>
