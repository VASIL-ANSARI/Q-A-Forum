<p>It seems to me like you want to set the opacity of the image itself to 0 and put a background image on its parent container:</p>

<pre><code>.envira-gallery-item-1 .envira-gallery-item-inner { 
    background: url('1-2-1.jpg') !important; 
}
.envira-gallery-item:hover img { 
    opacity: 0 !important; transition: opacity .2s; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since Envira adds a heavy styling on its galleries, you will need to add <code>!important</code> to most CSS rules.</p>
