<li>Process the list into a map so that <code>masterList.get("bunny") = 4</code>, etc.</li>
<li><p>Write your own <code>Comparator</code> with</p>

<pre><code>int compare(String a, String b) {
  return masterList.get(a) - masterList.get(b);
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Any solution has to be O(# of items in the largest list) in the worst case because you will have to search the entire large list just to find the positions of the items in the list you are sorting.</p>
