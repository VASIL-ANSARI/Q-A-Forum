<p>Global variables can contain any data type. The first shown code is likely not working because  the document isn't loaded when you fetch the value for <code>element</code>, while the second code is working because the document is loaded by the time <code>check()</code> is called.</p>

<p>If you want to use global variables, try this:</p>

<pre><code>var element;
var test = "Changed!";

window.onload = function() {
    element = window.document.getElementById("subtitle");
    check();
}
</code></pre>
