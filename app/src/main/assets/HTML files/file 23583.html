<p>Let me guess - you are calling <code>AppendCards</code> rapidly several times in a row and are getting the same numbers? This is because you are creating a new <code>Random</code> instance inside this method - move that out and reuse the same <code>Random</code> instance (e.g. by making <code>random</code> an instance variable).</p>

<p><code>Random</code> is using the current time as a seed value to determine the sequence of random numbers to generate - if you call <code>AppendCards</code> quickly (as in when the app is deployed) the time is the same still and the same number is generated. When you debug this in Visual Studio the problem goes away because when you step through time passes.</p>
