<p>It looks like you are trying to build the Sohpus library: a C++ implementation of Lie Groups using Eigen. I ran into the same problem and it seems to be an MSVC problem. I found this <a href="https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Sophus/commits/master" rel="nofollow">fork of the Sophus library</a>. This should compile using MSVC.</p>
