<p>Generally speaking, using singletons is more and more considered as a bad practice <em>(one reason is they make unit-testing harder, if not impossible)</em>.</p>

<p>To illustrate that : both symfony and Zend Framework, for their next major version (2.0) are trying to remove as many singletons as they can from both frameworks.</p>

<p><br>
That being said, singletons should be used when it makes sense to have one and only one instance of a given class ; does it make sense in your case ? Up to you to decide ;-)</p>

<p>If you don't want to call your singleton over and over again, you might want to store it in a local variable -- I suppose it might be seen as some kind of <em>(maybe "premature" / "useless")</em> optimization.</p>

<p>For instance, instead if having this kind of code :</p>

<pre><code>Singleton::getInstance()-&gt;method();
Singleton::getInstance()-&gt;method();
Singleton::getInstance()-&gt;method();
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have :</p>

<pre><code>$s = Singleton::getInstance();
$s-&gt;method();
$s-&gt;method();
$s-&gt;method();
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how much you'll gain from that, though...</p>
