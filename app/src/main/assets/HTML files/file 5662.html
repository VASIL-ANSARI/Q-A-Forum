<p>But In Java whole program is not written with using a single Class. And it is constants(public static final fields) that are like global variables.
And my advice is for you not concentrate on each of this single part of the java, what good about the java is the what it deliver as a whole. Because that's when you see the impartance of each of this features of java.</p>
