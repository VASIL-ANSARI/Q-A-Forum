<p>You're allocating your cylinder and sphere on the stack, then calling delete on pointers to them. This will destroy your objects twice. Once when you call delete, and once when they go out of scope (main ends).</p>

<p>Don't call delete on objects that you didn't create with new. Especially don't call delete on the address of stack objects.</p>
