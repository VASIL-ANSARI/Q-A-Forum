<p>I think you should change the sender part like this.    </p>

<pre><code>    @IBAction func newCardButtonPressed(sender: AnyObject) {

    self.labelText.text = "Pressed"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If your connections are not set properly your app also crash. Delete them and reconnect it.From Utilities/connections inspector.</p>
