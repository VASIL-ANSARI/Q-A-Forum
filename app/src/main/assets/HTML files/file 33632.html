<p>There are only a few different types of spaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>properties</li>
<li>railroads</li>
<li>chance / community chest</li>
<li>utilities</li>
<li>other single ones like go, jail, parking, tax</li>
</ul>

<p>For example you could have a <code>Property</code> class where each instance of the class has a different name/colour/price. You wouldn't have to make 22 different classes, just have 22 instances of the same class with different names.</p>

<p>Note that having class instances that represent spaces you can land on is only one way to implement a game like that. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't choose that option.</p>
