<p>I don't know if there is a good free SMS provider but i can certainly set you on your way on developing SMS applications.</p>

<p>First of all check out this very good tutorial: <a href="http://www.developershome.com/sms/smsIntro.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.developershome.com/sms/smsIntro.asp</a>.</p>

<p>I think all you need for a starters is your own SMS modem and a prepaid card to start testing out the SMS protocol.</p>

<p>As for the SMS gateway i would suggest trying out Clickatell. We were very pleased with it when we first used it, back in early 2009.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
