<p>For security reasons I would advise you not to forward any sensitive data through GET/POST parameters!
Even if they are encrypted, there might be a way for attackers to encrypt it and bring a lot of damage to you.</p>

<p>You should store the price of the product in a database. When the user selects a product you forward to sth. like</p>

<p>$form  = '&lt;form action="/buy.php?id=34"&gt;'</p>

<p>And in buy.php you then retrieve the price and additional informations from the database.</p>

<p>My advise is to read or at least have a look at <a href="http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/" rel="nofollow">PHP Security Guide</a></p>
