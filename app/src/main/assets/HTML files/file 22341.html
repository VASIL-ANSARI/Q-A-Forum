<p>Have you taken a look at the samples provided in the SDK?  If not, you'll find one called "Bluetooth Chat".  It provides the basis for everything you'll need.  I used it some time ago to do what you're trying to do.  Rip out what you don't need and add what you do, and you're off to the races.</p>

<p>I'd provide sample code except I don't have it anymore, sorry.  In any event, you'll find Bluetooth Chat to be a very complete example.</p>
