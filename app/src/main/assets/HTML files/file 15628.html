<p>This should be entirely possible in both PHP and Python. Basically, you want to issue an http request to the site in question and then analyze the response that you get back. Take a look at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" rel="nofollow">PHP's cURL</a> or <a href="http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Python's Pycurl</a> to sort out how to issue those http requests and how to process the responses.</p>

<p>Once you have the response back, it's just a matter of matching the pattern against some reliable pattern for blocked sites. My first guess is that you could look for <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://10.10.34.34?type=Invalid Site</code> within the response, however you would have to check more blocked pages to see if they all include that string. You might end up needing to broaden the check to a specific regular expression if, for instance, the IP or type querystring param varies from one blocked site to another.</p>
