<p>You don't need to seek each time you read from or write to the FileHandle. Your code could be simplified as follows:</p>

<pre><code>NSData *buffer;

NSFileHandle *outFile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleWithStandardOutput];

do {
    buffer = [inFile readDataOfLength: kBufSize];
    [outFile writeData:buffer];
} while ([buffer length] &gt; 0);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why you're reading in 128 byte chunks, but if that isn't necessary then you could eliminate the loop and do something like this instead (assuming your input file is not so huge it exceeds the maximum for an NSData object):</p>

<pre><code>NSFileHandle *outFile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleWithStandardOutput];
buffer = [inFile readDataToEndOfFile];
[outFile writeData:buffer];
</code></pre>
