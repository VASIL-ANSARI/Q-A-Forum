<p>First, make sure that your system is in development mode. Open <code>config/config.php</code> and confirm that APPLICATION_MODE is set to <code>in_development</code>:</p>

<pre><code>define('APPLICATION_MODE', 'in_development');
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have that covered, go to activeCollab and you'll have Developer toolbar available in the lower right corner of the application interface, next to activeCollab powered button (it has a red bug icon). Use this tool to clear cache, rebuild images etc.</p>

<p>PS: You can also clear all files from <code>/cache</code> folder, just in case.</p>
