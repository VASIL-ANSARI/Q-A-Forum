<p>For /lib and /vendor, you need to load them manually by mentioning the name.</p>

<pre><code># vendor/assets/foo.css.scss

# application.css
/= require 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>Also, for CSS, I prefer not to use <code>require_tree</code> but to require them one by one, as it's hard to control the order of requiring in tree. And the order does matter in CSS.</p>
