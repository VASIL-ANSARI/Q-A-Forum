<p>Are you sure that you're spawning an instance of the derived <strong>Blueprint class</strong> and not the parent C++ class from GameMode? </p>

<p>Also check that when you're trying to access the member variable, that you're casting the instance to the <strong>Blueprint class</strong> and not the C++ class.</p>

<p>If you're not already doing it, it might be a good idea to append <code>_BP</code> or something similar to all Blueprint derived classes to ensure you always know which version you're dealing with.</p>
