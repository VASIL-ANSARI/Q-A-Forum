<p>To trigger an event simply call the relevant event function in jQuery on the element, with no handler function defined, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#2").click();
</code></pre>

<p>Or there is also <code>trigger()</code>, which accepts the event type as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$("#2").trigger('click');
</code></pre>

<p>However it's worth noting that <code>Id</code> attributes beginning with numbers are invalid, so you will most likely have to change your Ids for them to work properly.</p>

<p>I've updated your fiddle to fix the IDs and show the above code working <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/RoryMcCrossan/x9Hfj/1/"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
