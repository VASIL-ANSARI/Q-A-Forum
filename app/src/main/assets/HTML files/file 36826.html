<p>First, don't do this. This will bring many problems upon you and make life much harder for you and your users. Anyway, python is very dynamic so you can do that.</p>

<p>Setup your package like that:</p>

<pre><code>yourpackage/
    __init__.py
    decorators.py
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>decorators.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code># List all decorators you want to publish. Use english names here.
__all__ = ['apple', 'orange', ...]

# Here come implementations named in english
def apple(...):
    ...

...
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>__init__.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Whatever over submodules export or just []
__all__ = [...]

from . import decorators

# Get locale somehow
LOCALE = ...

# This translation function could be as complex as you wish
# I use a lookup in hard-coded dict
TRANSLATIONS = {
    'fr': {'apple': u'pomme', ...},
    ...
}
def _translate_name(name):
    # If something is not translated we use default english name,
    # could be easily changed to raise error
    return TRANSLATIONS.get(LOCALE, {}).get(name, name)

# Generate dynamic attributes to current module and add them to __all__
import sys
this_module = sys.modules[__name__]

for name in decorators.__all__:
    translated = _translate_name(name)
    setattr(this_module, translated, getattr(decorators, name))
    __all__.append(translated)
</code></pre>

<p>Managing <code>__all__</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> is optional. This is to allow <code>from yourmodule import *</code>.</p>
