<p>You need to use <code>push_1</code> or <code>push_2</code> to move something by one or two of your defined grid positions. Obviously if the both ul's are in the same grid block then they will both move. You will need to separate anything that needs pushing in to another container.</p>

<p>The grid system is really useful when you have a proper understanding of how it works, I think you should get a good foundation about what goes on under the hood, one of the best tutorials for this is - <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/mastering-the-960-grid-system/" rel="nofollow">Mastering the 960 grid system</a></p>

<p>As an aside I can also highly recommend this online tool to help you when creating custom grids - <a href="http://grids.heroku.com/" rel="nofollow">online grid generator</a></p>
