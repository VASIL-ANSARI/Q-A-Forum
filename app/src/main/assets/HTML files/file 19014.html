<p>You aren't getting ERRORS, you're getting NOTICES.... in this case, you are echoing the value of $title when $title hasn't been defined... PHP can still run, but it's letting you know that this is something you should fix... </p>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>echo $title;
</code></pre>

<p>use </p>

<pre><code>echo (isset($title)) ? $title : '';
</code></pre>

<p>or define default '' values for these variables you're being warned about before trying to read from the database</p>

<p>And learn how to execute database queries that don't leave you open to SQL injection attacks</p>
