<p>I experienced a similar issue, when trying to nest a GADBannerView in a nib in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>nib</li>
<li>custom View Controller</li>
<li>UIView</li>
<li>custom View class</li>
<li>which then instantiated the GADBannerView in code</li>
</ul>

<p>A workaround I found was to uncheck the "Extend Edges ... Under Top Bars" checkbox in the view controller's nib's attributes inspector.</p>

<p>This of course means that the navigation controller shouldn't be translucent or you'll get some ugly fades behind the navigation controller.</p>
