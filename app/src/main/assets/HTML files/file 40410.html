<p>just change the type of the arguments in f1 into pointer variable.</p>

<p>void f1(char *ara, char *arb)</p>

<p>because while giving char it will take only one character as it has only one byte to store the character.</p>

<p>when you convert it into character pointer, it will have 4 bytes to store the string.</p>
