<p>The synchronized method "chat(...)" synchronizes on it's instance object whereas the synchronized(m) synchronizes on the "m" object - so they are synchronizing on two different objects.  Basically it's making sure that some other servlet object isn't messing with the same Member instance at the same time.</p>
