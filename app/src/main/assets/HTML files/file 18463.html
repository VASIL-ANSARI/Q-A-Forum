<p>Set up API versions, keep your current version as say version 1 and then add a v2 something like</p>

<pre><code>/current/api?id=x....
/version2/api?id=x...
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to update your api to support new functionality, and then you can set up a sunset plan for your out dated versions.</p>

<p>This way you can let your customers move over to your new system without it being an emergency.</p>
