<p>You declare (twice actually) a variable called virtualAlien (of type Virtual_Aliens). However, you never assign it anything (while using it all over the place.</p>

<p>You declaration needs to look like:</p>

<pre><code>Virtual_Alien virtualAlien = new Virtual_Alien();
</code></pre>

<p>This is assigns it to a new instance of the Virtual_Alien class, allowing you to use it later on. If you need parameters that aren't available until later, put the instantiation at the point when all needed information is available, and add null checks around any use of the variable that could happen before the instantiating code is called.</p>

<p>The romaingAlien member appears to have a similar problem.</p>
