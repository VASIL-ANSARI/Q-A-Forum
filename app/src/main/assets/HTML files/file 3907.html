<p>D have separate value and object semantics :</p>

<ul>
<li>if you declare your type as <code>struct</code>, it will have value semantic by default</li>
<li>if you declare your type as <code>class</code>, it will have object semantic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, assuming you don't manage the memory yourself, as it's the default case in D - using a garbage collector - you have to understand that object of types declared as <code>class</code> are automatically pointers (or "reference" if you prefer) to the real object, not the real object itself.</p>

<p>So, when passing vectors around in D, what you pass is the reference/pointer. Automatically. No copy involved (other than the copy of the reference).</p>

<p>That's why D, C#, Java and other language don't "need" moving semantic (as most types are object semantic and are manipulated by reference, not by copy).</p>

<p>Maybe they could implement it, I'm not sure. But would they really get performance boost as in C++? By nature, it don't seem likely.</p>
