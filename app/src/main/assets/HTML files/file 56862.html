<p>Exporting things from an entry point file does not make them available to the global scope. You have two options - either explicitly add the functions to the <code>window</code> object, like so:</p>

<pre><code>window.functionA = functionA;
</code></pre>

<p>Or configure your build to output as a library:</p>

<pre><code>// webpack.config.js - abridged
module.exports = {
    output: {
        library: "myModule",
        libraryTarget: "umd"
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know how the latter interacts with your entry point being set to an array of files - you may have to make a single entry file (<code>main.js</code> or something) that imports all of the functions and then re-exports them contained in an object, or something like that.</p>
