<p>Are you mixing two different versions of Spring?  Can you include the output of <code>mvn dependency:tree</code> here?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Based on the output of <code>mvn dependency:tree</code>, I can see that adding the dependency <code>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-consul-all:1.0.1.RELEASE</code> normally depends on <strong>Spring Boot 1.3.5.RELEASE</strong>, but you are including an older <strong>Spring Boot 1.2.3.RELEASE</strong> version in your POM.</p>

<p>Can you update your POM to use a consistent 1.3.5.RELEASE version of Spring Boot?  If possible, try to remove any explicit dependency declarations for Spring Boot and Spring Framework in your POM , and let <code>spring-cloud-starter-consul-all</code> include them for you.</p>
