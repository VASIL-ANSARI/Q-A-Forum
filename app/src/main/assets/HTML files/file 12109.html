<p>I'm sorry, your code is not syntactically valid. </p>

<p><code>2</code> and <code>3</code> should be declaration names. Like <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>. </p>

<p>To use the comma operator, you have to parenthesize <code>1, 2, 3</code>. </p>

<p>I will forgive you this accident and continue to explain.</p>

<p>If you use the comma operator, which is used as <code>operand1 , operand2</code>, it will give you the value (or lvalue) of <code>operand2</code>. So you initialize <code>b</code> to <code>6</code> (as in <code>(4, 5), 6</code>, since the comma operator is left associative). </p>
