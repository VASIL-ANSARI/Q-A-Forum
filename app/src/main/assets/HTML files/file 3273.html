<p>As far as i can see your logger is no different than ostringstream. It just takes what is given and outputs it to the string stream. If you want to use it like this, you can write a destructor for Logger which outputs the string to cout.</p>

<pre><code>Logger::~Logger()
{
    std::cout&lt;&lt;getcurrentDateTimeAsString()&lt;&lt;" "&lt;&lt;oss.str()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But of course, this will make no sense if a Logger* is created and used throughout the program.</p>
