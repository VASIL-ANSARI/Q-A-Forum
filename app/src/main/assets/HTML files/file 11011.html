<p>Im quite sure that the <code>Info.plist</code> file does not need to be in binary format to work. Does work if you just leave it as standard XML file?</p>

<p>I have seen this error message when the <code>CFBundleResourceSpecification</code> key was missing, should probably have the value <code>ResourceRules.plist</code>. It also seams to happen if the <code>CFBundleExecutable</code> key is missing.</p>

<p>A good way to see which keys that are used in a resulting app bundle is to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new fresh iOS app in Xcode</li>
<li>Configure minimum version, platform, orientations etc.</li>
<li>Build the app</li>
<li>Expand the "Product" group in the project tree and choose "Show in finder" on the app</li>
<li>Choose "Show Package Contents" on the app bundle</li>
<li>Open the <code>Info.plist</code> file and inspect it</li>
</ol>

<p>Use <code>plutil</code> if you want to convert to resulting binary plist to XML format.</p>
