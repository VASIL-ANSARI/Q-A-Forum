<p>The site is showing your global ip address (the one you use to connect to internet). <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> shows the client address, wich i'm guessing is your own machine, not going through internet at all. That's why it's showing you an local ip address, instead of a global one.</p>

<p>Bottomline: You request the remote server (whatismyip.com) with your global address, but request your local server with your local address (127.0.0.1 if it's on the same machine).</p>
