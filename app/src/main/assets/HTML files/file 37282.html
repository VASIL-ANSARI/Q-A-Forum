<p>You're using HTTP codes inappropriately.  </p>

<p>The redirect headers (301, et al) are intended to indicate that the requested content does exist and is reachable, it's just not at the location requested any more.  If you've unpublished a document then it's not accessible from any location.  Sending a 3XX redirect code in this case is wrong because you're misleading the browser and other user agents such as Google's bots.  </p>

<p>You should be sending a code that indicates that the content is no longer available (410 Gone, 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found) and display an error page.  That error page could be a copy of the home page if you want, but I'd advise against that for usability reasons.  It's better to tell people that content is no longer available than just redirect to the home page. </p>

<p>Incidentally, 302 no longer means "moved temporarily", it now means "found".  The correct HTTP code for temporary redirects is now 303 ("See other").  </p>
