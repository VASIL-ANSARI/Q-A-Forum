<p>I am assuming that the windows threading code you have shown isn't set in stone. I couldn't work out what you are trying to do with them. SInce you only have one mutex, (at least that what it looks like), all your threads will be blocked most of the time. </p>

<p>To quote from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11563502/intel-tbb-run-a-function-in-a-parallel-thread">Intel TBB run a function in a parallel thread?</a>:</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/uploads/81/91/Latest%20Open%20Source%20Documentation/Tutorial.pdf" rel="nofollow">TBB tutorial</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks targets threading for performance.
  Most general-purpose threading packages support many different kinds
  of threading, such as threading for asynchronous events in graphical
  user interfaces. As a result, general-purpose packages tend to be
  low-level tools that provide a foundation, not a solution. Instead,
  IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks focuses on the particular goal of
  parallelizing computationally intensive work, delivering higher-level,
  simpler solutions.</p>

<p>OpenCV uses TBB internally (if you build it with TBB) so you look at the source to see how things are done. Since 2.4.3 OpenCV has an inbuilt parallel_for_ construct (which uses TBB). You can find out some more about it at <a href="http://answers.opencv.org/question/3730/how-to-use-parallel_for/" rel="nofollow">http://answers.opencv.org/question/3730/how-to-use-parallel_for/</a></p>
