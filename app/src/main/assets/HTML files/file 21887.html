<p>I finally got this problem solved, thanks to @tcaswell ... I am inexperienced, so I'm not quite sure, in the end, what worked, but I will try to explain:</p>

<p>Short answer: Updating to latest matplotlib (to 1.2 from 1.0.1) seemed to be the solution.</p>

<p>Long answer: Updating matplotlib was not easy!  I tried a bunch of things, so I'm not sure what ended up working, but here's a general outline:</p>

<p>As of Feb. 9, 2013, apt-get install only gets version 1.0.1.  So, I uninstalled and installed from source as described on <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html" rel="nofollow">matplotlib page</a>.</p>

<p>When I tried this, the code compiled but my figure windows would not show up.  This was due to a backend problem, not recognizing GTK properly (or something like that).  To fix it, I customized the setup.cfg file for building matplotlib</p>

<pre><code>&lt;line 58&gt; gtk = True
&lt;line 57&gt; gtkagg = True
&lt;line 74&gt; backend = GTKAgg
</code></pre>

<p>Then I built and compiled as outlined on the above page.</p>

<p>NOTE:  I did a WHOLE bunch of other things, so I am not sure if the above is the minimal solution. </p>
