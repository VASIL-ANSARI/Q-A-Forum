<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements004.htm" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> for your homework, it isn't considered cheating (not at least more than asking in Stack Overflow):</p>

  <h2>Format Models</h2>

<pre><code>Element   Specify in TO_* datetime functions?     Description
MM        Yes                                     Month (01-12; January = 01)
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>nov</code> is clearly not a number between 1 and 12, thus the error.</p>

<p>And please learn to not disregard the error messages (you didn't even think about sharing it here): they're here to help.</p>

<hr>

<p>As about the <em>using sysdate in table causing error</em> title, you're confused. The default value of your column is not used: you assign a explicit value. If you want the default value, you have to leave the column out. That also means that you have to provide a column list in your query (which is anyway a good practice because your app will not break when you add new columns).</p>
