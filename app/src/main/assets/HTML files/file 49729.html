<p>This isn't currently possible with Jil, it can only deserialize complete JSON documents.</p>

<p>Speaking hypothetically: I'm not sure this would actually be any quicker either, because Jil would have to be able to stash its state (to subsequently resume) when it ran out of input.  Right now most of that state is on the stack, moving it out to the heap may cost more in runtime than you'd save.</p>
