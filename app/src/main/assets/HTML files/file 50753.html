<p>Usually one will define fiscal quarters specifically as a field on a calendar table, since often they don't operate as expected - 4-4-5 or 4-5-4 accounting, for example.</p>

<p>If you are just looking at calendar months, the use of a CASE WHEN expression and the MONTH() function might work. You'll need to figure out what the "starting" month is for that specific fiscal year, then use that to convert the MONTH() to a fiscal month 1 - 12, then CASE WHEN fisalMonth in (1,2,3) ... etc.</p>

<p>Really though - use a calendar table. See Aaron Bertrand's article here:
