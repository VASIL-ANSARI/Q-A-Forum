<p>In such cases, I usually either</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a ShowDialog function that does what I want (e.g. return the value) or</li>
<li>Just let the result be a property in the dialog. This is how the common file dialogs do it in the BCL. The caller must then read the property to get the result. That's fine in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also combine these methods, by making the result value a property in the dialog and creating a ShowDialog method that returns that property value, either as ByRef as you want or as a return value, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>I'll add this as a usage instruction, for example (sorry, no VB over here, and you said C# is welcome):</p>

<pre><code>using (var dlg = new DeptPicker()) {
    if (dlg.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK) {
        myTextBoxOrWhatEver.Text = dlg.TargetResult;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the dialog itself, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>void okButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TargetResult = whatever; // can also do this when the selection changes
    DialogResult = DialogResult.OK;
    Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't use the new ShowDialog implementation in this sample though.</p>
