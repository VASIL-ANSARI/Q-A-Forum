<p>I would normally expect this to be a client-side issue (however - check Pascal's answer). The clients will have a defined timeout value and would bail out on an operation taking too long.</p>

<p>e.g. in <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/" rel="nofollow">HttpClient</a> you can define the connection timeout, and the read timeouts separately (see <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/preference-api.html" rel="nofollow">the configuration guide</a>). </p>

<p>If the method truly takes 5 mins or more, I would look at how to break that operation down into more discrete operations, each taking a shorter period of time. Or do the processing in the background, and give the client a ticket such that they can receive their results at a later time without maintaining a connection. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you <em>may</em> be able to set an infinite timeout, but I wouldn't recommend this, since your client ideally should be able to identify when your server isn't responding due to problems/misconfiguration etc.</p>
