<p>Off the top of my head: you can use <code>PLINQ</code> to improve the search response time (if your machine is multi-core)</p>

<pre><code>var result = data.AsParallel()
    .Where(c =&gt; c.Contains(query));
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, as <strong>@Tim Schmelter</strong> pointed out, you should use a database table.</p>
