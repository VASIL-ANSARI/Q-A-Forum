<p>By Default your Views have access to the User Object.</p>

<p>You can check on the View if User.IsInRole("myDeleteRole").</p>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>@if(User.IsInRole("MyDeleteRole"))
{
&lt;input type="subtmt" value="Delete"&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if this is the best way, but its what i have done in the past</p>

<p>I guess another way would be to write seperate Views depending on what rights a user has. that way you could do the logic on the controller and send the user to the specified view</p>

<pre><code>if(User.IsInRole("MyDeleteRole")
{
return View("MyDeleteView", vm)
}
else
{
return View("NoDeleteView", vm)
}
</code></pre>
