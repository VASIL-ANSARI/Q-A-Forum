<p>Begin request happens before the user is fully authenticated in the request life cycle.</p>

<p>I solved this issue by adding a cookie if the user is in a role ("Admin" in your case) when the request is authenticated then you can check for this cookie on begin request and initialise the profiler.  </p>

<p>It wont't work the first time but should every time after that.</p>
