<p>Either I don't understand your intention, or the solution is trivial:</p>

<pre><code>group = "A A A B C C".split()
value = [0,20,25,5,6,17]
df = DataFrame(zip(group, value), columns='group value'.split())
df

     group   value
0    A       0
1    A       20
2    A       25
3    B       5
4    C       6
5    C       17

g = df.groupby('group')
g.sum()[(g.sum() &gt;=10)['value']]

     value
group   
A    45
C    23
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you are assuming that you can select stuff within the groupby object. As far as I know, you can't. But you can do that in the resulting object, <strong>after</strong> you apply your aggregation function.</p>
