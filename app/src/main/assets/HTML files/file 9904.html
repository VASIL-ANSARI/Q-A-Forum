<blockquote>
  <p>This problem occurs because when you
  set the UniqueValues query property to
  Yes, a DISTINCT keyword is added to
  the resulting SQL statement. The
  DISTINCT keyword directs Access to
  perform a comparison between records.
  When Access performs a comparison
  between two Memo fields, Access treats
  the fields as Text fields that have a
  255-character limit. Sometimes Memo
  field data that is larger than 255
  characters will generate the error
  message that is mentioned in the
  "Symptoms" section. Sometimes only 255
  characters are returned from the Memo
  field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Workaround:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To work around this problem, modify
  the original query by removing the
  Memo field. Then, create a second
  query that is based on both the table
  and the original query. This new query
  uses all the fields from the original
  query, and this new query uses the
  Memo field from the table. When you
  run the second query, the first query
  runs. Then, this data is used to run
  the second query. This behavior
  returns the Memo field data based on
  the returned data of the first query.</p>
