<p>Any chance you'll be upgrading to SQL2005 soon? If so, you could probably leverage their TRY/CATCH model to more easily accomplish what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>The variables exposed in the catch can give you the object throwing the error, the line number, error message, severity, etc.  From there, you can log it, send an email, etc.</p>
