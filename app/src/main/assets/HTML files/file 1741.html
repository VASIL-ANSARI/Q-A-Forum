<p>As far as the "Real World" is concerned, it's probably fair to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>enough programmers know that multiplication/division take precedence over addition/subtraction, as is mathematically the convention</li>
<li>hardly any programmers can remember any of the other rules of precedence</li>
</ul>

<p>So, apart from the specific case of <code>*/</code> vs <code>+-</code>, I'd really just use brackets to explicitly define the precedence intended.</p>
