<p>pubsub problems solved (although exe still not running).</p>

<p>So if you look at comments <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/ticket/312" rel="nofollow">here</a> (especially comment #15 by sebastian.hilbert) it mostly solves the problems with some tweaking.  </p>

<p>The necessary tweaks.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Change the names on the hook files to hook-pubsub.core.py and hook-pubsub.setuparg1.py.</li>
<li>Internal to those files you should get rid of references to wx.</li>
<li>Enable the hook files.  You can do this one of two ways.  The easy way is to drop these new hook files into 'pyinstaller-2.0\PyInstaller\hooks' which is where pyinstaller looks for hooks by default.  The clean/nice way to do this is to put these hooks into their own folder and add that folder as hookspath in your spec file.  </li>
</ol>

<p>NB: It was not clear to me how to add a hookspath.  In your specfile, in the call to Analyze, there is a hookspath arg.  It wants a list not a string.  So you want to do something like hookspath=['path1', 'path2', etc].  </p>

<p>NB2: Additionally if you ask for "path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__))" you will get the directory for pyinstaller not the location where your spec file lives.</p>
