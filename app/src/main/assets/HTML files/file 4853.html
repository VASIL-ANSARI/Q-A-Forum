<p>Your <code>x</code> only exists within the scope of the assignment, so it's already gone by the time you get to <code>&gt; 2</code>. What is the point of this anyway? Are you trying to write deliberately unreadable code?</p>

<p>Your best way to get around this is to declare <code>x</code> in a scope that will remain valid throughout the <code>if</code> statement. Seriously though, I fail to understand what you're doing here. Why are you creating a variable that is supposed to disappear again immediately?</p>
