<p>You need about 2.5 megs, so just using the heap should be fine.  You don't need a vector unless you need to resize it.  See <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#multidim-arrays" rel="nofollow">C++ FAQ Lite</a> for an example of using a "2D" heap array.</p>

<pre><code>int *array = new int[800*800];
</code></pre>

<p>(Don't forget to <code>delete[]</code> it when you're done.)</p>
