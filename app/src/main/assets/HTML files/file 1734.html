<a href="http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/ext/filter/logical_filters.c?view=markup" rel="nofollow">http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/ext/filter/logical_filters.c?view=markup</a></p>

<p>and is actually done in /trunk/ext/standard/url.c</p>

<p>At a first glance I can't see anything that purposely rejects non-ASCII characters, so it's probably just lack of unicode support. PHP is not good in handling non-ASCII characters anywhere. :(</p>
