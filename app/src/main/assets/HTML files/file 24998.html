<p>After many days of tinkering, I solved my own problem.  I just thought I'd post it here in case anybody else develops the same problem I did and needs the answer.</p>

<p>First, I have to take credit for my own mistake.  I was attempting to use jQuery knob for a purpose other than the one it was intended for.  I really only wanted it to display the progress of an upload.  I had no intention of using it to input anything so I put it in a standard div.  It worked fine in the div for everything other than the numeric upload percentage.  I couldn't get it to display a number in the center of the circle.</p>

<p>The problem is that it wasn't intended to be in an div at all.  It wouldn't accept an 'input' value because it wasn't an input field.  Once I assigned the .knob to an input field everything fell right into line.</p>

<p>For anybody that reads this later and laughs, I'm glad I amused you.  For anybody that it helps, well, that's good too.</p>
