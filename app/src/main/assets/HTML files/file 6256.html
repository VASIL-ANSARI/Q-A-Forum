<p>I'm not entirely certain about how to do this in Google Maps completely, but you can get the details of a place (including the all important longitude and latitude) very easily through the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/" rel="nofollow">Geocoding API</a>.</p>

<p>For example: <a href="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=WC1&amp;sensor=false" rel="nofollow">http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=WC1&amp;sensor=false</a> </p>

<p>Although you are able to put addresses, rather than postcodes in there. You could then use this information with your own database of places. For example, you can download the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/" rel="nofollow">GeoNames</a> database and use something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3922404/how-to-efficiently-find-the-closest-locations-nearby-a-given-location/3922471">this answer</a> to find the closest places in your database.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use something like the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foursquare-api/web/api-documentation" rel="nofollow">FourSquare API</a> to get a list of places in the area. You could even use the service to pull features like the tips or who is around. When I was looking for the Geocode API, I stumbled upon the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/" rel="nofollow">Google Places API</a>. I haven't used it and it's in developer preview at the moment, but the documentation looks interesting at least.</p>

<p>You might want to just check the TOS on whatever service you use. I remember at one stage that you couldn't use the map API if you're not displaying a map on the page, etc.</p>
