<p>You undoubtedly had another version of Python installed, independent of the Apple-supplied system Pythons, which was migrated. If you used python.org installers, that Python would be in <code>/Library/Frameworks</code>. If you use a third-party package manager, like MacPorts or Homebrew, it is likely somewhere else. You can use <code>type python</code> to find out where you are picking up Python from and then either upgrade it or remove it. Do not try to remove the Apple Pythons in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks</code>. With Yosemite, Apple ships 2.7.6.  You can either upgrade the additional Python, for example, by downloading and installing the latest Python 2 from python.org (currently 2.7.9), or follow the instructions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/how-to-uninstall-python-2-7-on-a-mac-os-x-10-6-4/">here</a> to remove it.</p>
