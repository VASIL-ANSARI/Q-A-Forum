<p>Answering to a second part of the question - what containers support registration overriding.</p>

<p><strong>Ninject</strong>.</p>

<p>See Bind()/Unbind() methods.</p>

<p>I tried also Autofac but seems that the registration becomes frozen after it being built. So seems that it may not be also possible with Autofac.</p>
