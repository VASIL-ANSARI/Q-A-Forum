<p>You need to handle the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff865381(v=office.15).aspx" rel="nofollow">Send</a> event of the MailItem class which is fired when the user selects the Send action for an item. </p>

<p>Also you may find the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff865076(v=office.15).aspx" rel="nofollow">ItemSend</a> event of the Application class which is fired whenever an Microsoft Outlook item is sent, either by the user through an Inspector (before the inspector is closed, but after the user clicks the Send button) or when the Send method for an Outlook item, such as MailItem, is used in a program. Note, if the event procedure sets the Cancel argument to true, the send action is not completed and the inspector is left open.</p>
