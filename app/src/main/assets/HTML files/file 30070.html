<p>Two possibilities:</p>

<p>1)  What does curataTabla() do?  I don't see this method - it's possible you have a bug in this code which causes the position to remain set.</p>

<p>2)  Are you sure Human first is selected?  It's also possible that the computer is always going first, and just happens to be choosing this location every time.</p>

<p>Hard to debug without more code.</p>

<p>Also, check this code:</p>

<pre><code> //cod nou
    if(jocnou.isPressed()){

        mGameOver=true;

        incepeJocNou();
        //mBoardsButtons[0].setText("");

        mGameOver=false;
        }

    if(!mGameOver){
</code></pre>

<p>Everytime new game is selected, you set mGameover to true, create a new game, then set it to false.  That means that everytime you do a new Game, you're actually doing a new game AND a move, not just a new game.  I'm not sure this is where the bug comes from, but it could be leading to unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>I think you should try breaking the New Game onClickListener and normal ClickListernes into two separate listeners and see if that resolves this.  My guess is that you're getting unintended behavior because you're dual purposing one listener.</p>
