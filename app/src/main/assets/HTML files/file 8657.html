<p>I see no problem in what you explain. If you could fill the grid data using <code>url: 'JsonData.asmx/GetData'</code> it should continue to work inside of the form. You should only verify the font size which you use in the form to have good look together with the grid.</p>

<p>If you need reload data in the grid you can use <code>$("#grid_id").trigger('reloadGrid',[{page:1}]);</code> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3807623/jqgrid-paging-question/3808014#3808014">here</a>).</p>

<p>One other possible problem which you could have: one should create jqGrid once. If you for example need create the form once which contain one grid and later change the for contain to have another grid you could have to use <a href="http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki%3amethods#add_on_grid_methods" rel="nofollow">GridUnload</a> method. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232038/jqgrid-add-new-column/4232168#4232168">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ok-soft-gmbh.com/jqGrid/RecreateGrid.htm" rel="nofollow">the demo</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4920323/jqgrid-gridunload-griddestroy/4920612#4920612">here</a>.</p>
