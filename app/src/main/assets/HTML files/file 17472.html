<p>Yes, you can have as many RadAjaxpanel controls as you like.  Note, however, RadAjaxPanel functions differently than the UpdatePanel.  Only one RadAjaxPanel posts back at a time; however, you can call the client-side API ajaxRequest("arg"); method to refresh the other.  I've never had an issue where one panel disappears... we'll probably need to see some code in order to debug.</p>

<p>You can also use the RadAjaxManager (or proxy) to define the AJAX controls that should be updated when one control causes a postback.  This way, you can link the updates to all when the button clicks happen.</p>
