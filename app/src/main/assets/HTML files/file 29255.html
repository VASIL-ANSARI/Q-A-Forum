<p>I was unable to find information on precisely when and what goes to private memory versus javascript memory.  However I can answer this: "would having the chrome debugger open impact this" ... YES.  </p>

<p>Having the developer tools opened causes the browser to gather/retain/display a lot more information about each and every XHR that is being made.  This data is not gathered/retained when the developer tools are closed (as most know since it is sometimes bloody annoying when you open the dev tools to late and it missed that one request you cared about).</p>

<p>You can open the dev tools, trigger the GC, then close the dev tools, opening them only again to trigger the GC when you want to take the metric.  Also you can use this sucker chrome://memory-redirect/ to keep track of the growth without opening the dev tools.</p>
