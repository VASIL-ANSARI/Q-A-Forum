<p>This appears to be an issue with <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html#instant-run" rel="nofollow">Instant Run</a> being incompatible with something in your code - potentially a library that generates code.</p>

<p>You can disable Instant Run and it should fix this problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Instant Run > Uncheck "Enable Instant Run"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to keep Instant Run you can just UnCheck "Restart Activity on Code Changes"</p>
