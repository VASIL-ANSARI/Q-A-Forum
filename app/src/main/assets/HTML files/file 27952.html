<p>Parameters in SQL queries are always replaced as fixed values.
In other words, strings are always replaced as strings, not as column names.</p>

<p>To customize column names in your query, you must not use SQL parameters but do the replacement in Python:</p>

<pre><code>cursor.execute('SELECT %s FROM song WHERE title = ? AND artist = ?' % (query),
               (title, artist))
</code></pre>
