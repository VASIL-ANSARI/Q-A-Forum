<p>Ok, I'll try to guess. Are you running a development server? As I can see it is Apache-licensed, so you are free to do whatever you want, including running it on your server and letting others use web-applications hosted on it.</p>

<p>Now everything depends on particular application's licensing terms. If its licence allows you to run itâyou can run it. That's it.</p>

<p>Speaking about GPL, it has a funny flaw: when you are running a web-application you are not distributing the application and thus you can overcome GPL restrictions. That's why <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html" rel="nofollow">AGPL</a> exists.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: you mentiond <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/terms" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> in your comment. Basically you shouldn't care about it, because you've got a software (<code>dev_appserver</code>), you've got a license with it and this license explicitly allows you to do whatever (almost) you want.</p>

<p>If you are really worried about this Terms, look at 4.4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source software licenses for components of the Service released
  under an open source license constitute separate written agreements.
  Open source software is listed in the Documentation. To the limited
  extent <strong>the open source software licenses expressly supersede this
  Agreement</strong>, the open source license instead governs Customer's
  agreement with Google for the specific included open source components
  of the Service, or use of the Service (as may be applicable).</p>
