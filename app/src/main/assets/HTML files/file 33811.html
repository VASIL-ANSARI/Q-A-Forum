<p>Add a negative lookahead <code>(?!/)</code> in your regex to check that there is no further <code>/</code> after matching the odds. In your case its picking odd number of <code>/</code> from the <code>//</code> or <code>///</code>, hence didn't work.</p>

<pre><code>String regex = "^/(//)*(?!/)";
                       ^^^^^ here
</code></pre>
