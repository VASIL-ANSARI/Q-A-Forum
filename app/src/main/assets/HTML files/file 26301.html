<p>The window.alert function and the jQuery UI dialogue are not related; the popup is just html. 
The easiest solution to switching to a dialogue is to do the following:</p>

<ul><li>put a blank div in your html</li>
<li>initialize it with jQuery UI with autoOpen set to false</li>
<li>instead of calling alert, replace the html of the blank div with the contents you would put in the alert and then show the jQuery dialog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before getting to my example, I have some general advice: don't ever put more than a single function inside an html tag. In general, try to keep your JavaScript and your html separate, as it'll make your (and anyone working with your code's) life easier. And since you're using jQuery, it's better to avoid JavaScript inside tags altogether by using the <code>.on()</code> function and binding your functions programmatically.</p>

<p>So I worked on your fiddle a bit, and got the jQuery UI dialog working. I also removed all the javascript from your html.</p>

<p>Lines 1-23 bind function to the form's onsubmit, the textbox's onfocus and onblur, and initializes the jQuery UI dialog (docs <a href="http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<p>Starting from Line 504, I've modified the alert to use the jQuery UI dialog.
I did this by setting the old alert text as a variable and replacing the newlines with html linebreaks so they show up properly in the dialog. And then I inserted the content into the dialog and opened the dialog.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/asifrc/JHRtX/9/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know if it all makes sense to you, or if you have any questions :)</p>

<p>P.S. When you use jQuery <code>$('#pellscore').val()</code> is way shorter than <code>document.getElementById('pellscore').value</code> ;)</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>So here's the problem with your current setup: you're using (and relying on) a ridiculously old version of reveal.js. My guess is that you googled "jquery reveal" and came across <a href="https://github.com/zurb/reveal" rel="nofollow">this link to zurb's version of reveal.js</a>. If that's how you got it, (and most definitely if you got it from somewhere else) you probably didn't notice that a) it hasn't been updated in two years,  b) it uses jQuery 1.4.4, which is three years old, or c) the the bold notice that states that it won't be updated anymore.</p>

<p>Either way, the reason your page breaks is because jquery.reveal.js makes a call to <code>.live</code>, which is deprecated since jquery 1.7 and completely removed as of 1.9 .</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>I hate the idea of patching something that's two years old, but unless you want to rewrite a bunch of code and try integrating the <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js" rel="nofollow">current version of reveal.js</a> (<a href="https://raw.github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/master/js/reveal.js" rel="nofollow">source</a>), I recommend the following quick fix:</p>

<p>Open up jquery.reveal.js, go to line 20, and replace <code>.live</code> with <code>.on</code>, e.g.
from</p>

<pre><code>$('a[data-reveal-id]').live('click', function(e)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>$('a[data-reveal-id]').on('click', function(e)
</code></pre>

<p>That should fix your problem. I tried it locally and it seemed to work. Let me know if it works for you :)</p>
