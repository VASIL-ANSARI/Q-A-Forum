<p><strike>I've not used the module, but it seems like mouse events are thrown for mouse <em>raises</em> as well.</strike></p>

<p>You'll need to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Store the mouse state for next time</p></li>
<li><p>Each iteration, test whether the mouse state for button 0 has gone up â down</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The mouse state is returned by <code>myMouse.getPressed</code>.</p>

<p>So something like:</p>

<pre><code>oldMouseIsDown = False

while True:
    ...

    mouseIsDown = myMouse.getPressed()[0]
    myMouse.clickReset()

    if mouseIsDown and not oldMouseIsDown:
        print myMouse.getPos()

    oldMouseIsDown = mouseIsDown
</code></pre>
