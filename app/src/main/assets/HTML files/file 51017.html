<p>The problem was the rate at witch the force is being applied.</p>

<p>In the PC the Update() function get's called very fast and therefore the AddForce is called constantly piling up a good amount of force.</p>

<p>In the Phone, the FPS are fewer and the Update function is called less often, then the force added is piling up more slowly. </p>
