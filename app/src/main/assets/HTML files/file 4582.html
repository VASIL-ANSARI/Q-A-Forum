<p>Just use a normal <code>type="submit"</code> input or button and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> combination (been around forever), like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="mypage.htm" method="post"&gt;
  //fields..
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Click to submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript, handle the <code>submit</code> event of the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>...so you capture the submit, do something with JavaScript is enabled (AJAX submission for example), but it's not <em>not</em> enabled, it degrades gracefully and will submit to the server/do a full page refresh.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have the reverse problem that it's already like this and you <em>don't</em> want the submit behavior, then don't use a submit button...but I advise against this, since your site <em>should</em> degrade gracefully for JavaScript disabled users.</p>
