<p>So what happens in this program is:</p>

<p>a = 0, b = 1</p>

<p>c is set to their sum, = 1</p>

<p>a is set to b, = 1</p>

<p>b is set to c, = 1</p>

<p>a = 1, b = 1</p>

<p>c is set to their sum, = 2</p>

<p>a is set to b, = 1</p>

<p>b is set to c, = 2</p>

<p>a = 1, b = 2</p>

<p>c is set to their sum, = 3</p>

<p>a is set to b, = 2</p>

<p>b is set to c, = 3</p>

<p>a = 2, b = 3</p>

<p>c is set to their sum, = 5</p>

<p>a is set to b, = 3</p>

<p>b is set to c, = 5</p>

<p>a = 3, b = 5</p>

<p>... And so on. You should get the idea :)</p>
