<p>well after tampering around i finally found the cause to all this.
it seems the android mediarecorder appends the moov atom to the end of the recorder video yet when streaming with the mediaplayer the file must have its moov atom in the begining.</p>

<p>so there u go for anybody struggling with recorder videos not streaming back</p>
