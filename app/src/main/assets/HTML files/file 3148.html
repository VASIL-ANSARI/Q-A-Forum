<p>In my experience, having developed cross-platform applications with both PyQt and PyGTK, you should consider moving to PyQt. It comes with a browser widget by default which runs fine on all platforms, and support for non-Linux platforms is outstanding compared to PyGTK. For PyGTK, you will have to be prepared building PyGObject/PyCairo/PyGTK, or even the full stack, yourself on Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
