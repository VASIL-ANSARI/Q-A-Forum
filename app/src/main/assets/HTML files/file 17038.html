<p>It is perfectly thread-safe for what you're doing, in fact this is what it's designed for. The description of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html"><code>BlockingQueue</code></a> (which is the interface implemented by <code>LinkedBlockingQueue</code>) states:</p>

<blockquote>

  achieve their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms
  of concurrency control.</p>
