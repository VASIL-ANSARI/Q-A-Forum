<p>As it turns out, this problem was dependent on the <code>/k</code> parameter that the method added to each command call. The <code>/k</code> flag tells the console to keep the output open, causing things like consistent timeouts using this asynchronous method, clogging system memory, and preventing <code>process.WaitForExit()</code> from returning. Instead, I am now using the <code>/c</code> flag before each command call and am successfully reading the output from each command. In calling <code>AsyncCommandCall(command, null, 100)</code> 1000 times in a row looping through three commands (An <code>echo</code>, a <code>dir</code>, and a <code>psexec</code>), there were 0 timeouts and 0 failed reads.</p>
