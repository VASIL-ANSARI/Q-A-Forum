<p>Found it and fixed it.  The <code>pathname</code> getter/setter simply was undefined for <code>HTMLAnchorElement</code> in <code>env.js</code>.  </p>

<p>I submitted <a href="https://github.com/envjs/env-js/pull/34" rel="nofollow">a pull request</a>, but unfortunately the project looks all but abandoned.  I also couldn't figure out how to build it out to a single file.  It appears perhaps someone has taken it upon themselves to break it apart into <code>require.js</code> modules.  Not a battle worth fighting for my use case.</p>

<p>So for anyone else who hits this issue, I have the code you need below.  It belongs in the <code>HTMLAnchorElement.prototype</code>.  In my copy of <code>env.js</code> 1.2, this prototype begins on line 8075.  I added the following at line 8118.</p>

<pre><code>get pathname() {
  var uri = Envjs.urlsplit(this.href);
  return uri.path;
},
set pathname(val) {
  var uri = Envjs.urlsplit(this.href);
  uri.path = val
  this.href(uri.urlunsplit(uri));
},
</code></pre>

<p>FYI, my particular issue is resolved with <a href="https://github.com/guardian/sbt-jasmine-plugin/pull/18" rel="nofollow">this pull request</a>.</p>
