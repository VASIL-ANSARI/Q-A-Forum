<p>Store the score in your view controller instance, or subclass the SKView and store it there. This will retain any object for the lifetime of the view.</p>

<p>If you need the scores to be persisted between app restarts, use <code>NSUserDefaults</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://koboldkit.com">Kobold Kit</a> actually makes stuff like this easy with no custom subclasses. The view has (and any node can have) a <code>KKModel</code> object which is a key/value storage for both integral types (float, int, etc via <code>KKMutableNumber</code>) and arbitrary objects. </p>

<p>So you can persist and access your highscores object <strong>from any node</strong> by tying it to the view:</p>

<pre><code>[self.kkView.model setObject:highscores forKey:@"highscores"];
</code></pre>

<p>The kkView property is shorthand for writing <code>(KKView*)self.view</code>.</p>

<p>There's <strong>absolutely no need to use or benefit in using singletons</strong> for objects whose lifetime is tied either to the scene or the view. They belong to either the scene or the view, period.</p>
