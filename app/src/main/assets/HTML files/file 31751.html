<p>You need to use the correlated subquery and for the error it clearly says there should be one column from your subquery </p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  g.id,
  g.title,
  g.developer,

  (SELECT 
    COUNT(*) 
  FROM
    reviews 
  WHERE games_ean = g.ean) AS Numberofreviews 
FROM
  games g
  INNER JOIN reviews r 
    ON g.ean = r.games_ean ;
</code></pre>
