<p>There is no such thing as "Old" on an insert trigger, because the old row didn't exist.  You are only inserting a new row.  </p>

<p>I think what you want is</p>

<pre><code>for each row

insert into Likes (FirstID,SecondID)
select hs.id, new.id
from HighShooler hs
where hs.grade = new.grade
and hs.id != new.id
</code></pre>
