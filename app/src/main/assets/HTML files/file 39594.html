<p>Strange placement of the icon, as it should normally be on the same div that holds the image, something like what Fancybox <a href="http://fancybox.net/" rel="nofollow">http://fancybox.net/</a> does.</p>

<p>In your case, the  is completely independent of the wrap for your image, hence the location wont match exactly the place in the corner you want it to be.</p>
