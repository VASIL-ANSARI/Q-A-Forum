<p>I had this problem when behind a firewall.
I got around it by going to Xcode > Contents > Applications > Application Loader > Contents > MacOS > itms > java > lib  - Open net.properties with TextEdit and change the line 
<code># https.proxyPort=443</code>
 to <code>https.proxyPort=80</code>.  This enables the application to use the HTTP port for HTTPS. Worked straight away after this. Hope this helps. </p>
