<p>I would create the dictionary with the full story texts as the keys and the document numbers as the values. Then just check if the user inputed phrase is in one of the keys and then get the document number like this:</p>

<pre><code>for key in story_document_dict:
  if phrase in key:
    return story_document_dict[key]
</code></pre>
