<p>Back in the day...</p>

<p>Really, this is going way back. I don't remember that there was a way to control the property name appearance directly. You could make sure your property descriptors had categories and those categories would be bold.</p>

<p>Also (and I don't think this is still true in "later" versions of Windows), you could return true from your property descriptor's <code>ShouldSerializeValue</code> method...and it would cause the PropertyGrid to display the property <em>value</em> in bold.</p>

<p>Also seems like you could identify <em>one</em> of your properties as the object's default property (in the object's type descriptor). Seems like there were differing behaviors depending on the version of Windows...after XP, I think this would float the property to the top...but maybe XP and before it would make the property name bold...but I could be misremembering. I've slept more than once since then.</p>

<p>With the property grid, I seem to remember running into the argument that doing any more formatting might interfere with all the complex layout the grid was already doing on the object's behalf. Back then, I was using the property grid to format hierarchical objects...and I remember being impressed with it's capabilities despite it's relative lack of formatting control.</p>

<p>Of course, after spending time in WPF, you can't help but feel like you can affect anything and everything, yes?</p>
