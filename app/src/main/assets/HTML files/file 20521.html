<p>I'm not completely familiar with <code>xpath</code>, but you should be able to just check the length of <code>cols</code> (as long as it isn't a really strange object that looks like a sequence in other ways):</p>

<pre><code> if len(cols) &gt;= 5:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Another common python idiom is to just try it and see.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    c.writerow([cols[0], cols[1], cols[2], cols[3], cols[4]])
except IndexError:
    #failed because `cols` isn't long enough.  Do something else.
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, assuming <code>cols</code> is a <code>list</code>, you can always make sure that it is long enough:</p>

<pre><code>cols.extend(['']*5)
</code></pre>

<p>which will pad your columns with empty strings so that you have <em>at least 5 columns</em> (usually more). </p>
