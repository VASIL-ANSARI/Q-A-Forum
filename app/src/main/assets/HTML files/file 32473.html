<p>Figured it out finally, although i'm not sure what it was exactly. My guess is, I was trying to post as a text post and not a link post.</p>

<pre><code>    FB.api(
        '/kidtask/feed/',
        'post',
        {
            name: 'whatever',
            link: 'http://url',
            actions: { name: 'Vote Now', link: 'http://url' },
            description:"\u003Cbr/\u003E",
            picture:"http://imageurl",
            caption:"\u003Cbr/\u003E",
            properties: [{"text":"test 1","href":"http://url"},{"text":"test 2","href":"http://url"},{"text":"test 3","href":"http://url"}]
        },
</code></pre>
