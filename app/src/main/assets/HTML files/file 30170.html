<p>No. Because it's array-backed, it can't be larger than 2^31-1. This applies to all <code>Collections</code> if you want the <code>size()</code> and <code>toArray()</code> methods to work. </p>

<p>You'll need to store lists of lists, but I bet there's a library that can do it. I haven't used that part of it, but <a href="http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/#big" rel="nofollow">Fastutil has big data structures</a> in addition to its primitive data structures.</p>
