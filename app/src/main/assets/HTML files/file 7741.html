<p>You would just create 2 rows, and add a column.  example:</p>

<pre><code>owner_id | user_from | user_to | mailbox_folder | Message
1          1           2         Sent             Hi
2          1           2         Inbox            Hi
</code></pre>

<p>Other columns: a unique row id, timestamps, subject line, etc...</p>

<p>Your mailboxes would then be built off of the owner_id column, and each user has their own copy to move/delete as they choose.</p>

<p>To add conversations, you could add a column, or another table.  If it's a new message, get a new conversation id, otherwise use the same ID.  Query by timestamps.</p>
