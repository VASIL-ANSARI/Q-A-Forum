<p>It sounds like your force exited thread is not exited cleanly. A cleanly exited thread should have all its context destroyed and not leaving any residue. The pthread can be either joinable or detached, which type of thread creation you use? After your force exit happen, does your "Client" object destroyed? What about the logic that creates the thread, does it handle exception of a zombie thread? Answer all theses question yourself and handles all these details.</p>
