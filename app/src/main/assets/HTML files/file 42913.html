<p>In the Solution options (right click the Solution in the Solution window and select Options) you can configure multiple startup projects in the Run - Startup Project section.</p>

<p>Testing this with Xamarin Studio 5.8 running two console apps, using Run - Start without Debugging, seems to work but debugging two console apps fails. Also you do not seem to be able to debug an ASP.NET app with a separate client app, but you can run both together without the debugger.</p>

<p>If you need to debug both then running two instances of Xamarin Studio will allow you to do that.</p>
