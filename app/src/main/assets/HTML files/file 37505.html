<p><strong>PyPDF2</strong> is compatible with Python 3.4, so that's not the problem.</p>

<p>In which Python version do you have pip installed? Even though you're on <code>python34</code>, if pip is installed to a different version it will download libraries to that version.</p>

<p>In any case, you can always install by downloading from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&amp;name=PyPDF2&amp;version=1.23" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>, then running <code>setup.py install</code>.</p>

<p>Still, the only possible explanation I have is that the current Python version you're on does <em>not</em> have PyPDF2 installed. See if you can import PyPDF2 from any of the other versions.</p>
