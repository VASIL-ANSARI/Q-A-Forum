<p>The option with the best support would be javascript local storage. It is supported by all browsers vs web SQL isn't. Cookies only allow 4kb so that won't be good. Local storage allows up to 5mb of storage. It is simple to store and retrieve items I will give you a link to a page that shows how or just google local storage. Another thing local storage is javascript. Another thing would be browser caching to store the actual page files and images in the browser cache. This option has its downfalls since the user can disable the cache and set how much data can be cached plus the cache data allowed is shared between all websites which means once the cache is gone you can't store anything.
