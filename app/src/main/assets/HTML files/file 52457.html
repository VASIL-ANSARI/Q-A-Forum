<p>The fields are arrays of <code>char</code>.  You have to copy the <code>char</code>s into the array.  Try something like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcpy" rel="nofollow"><code>strcpy()</code></a>, as you did in line 5.  You can't just assign a "string" like that.</p>

<p>Line 1 works because it's an initialization, not an assignment.  The compiler gives it the value provided when it allocates space for it on the stack.</p>

<p>If the fields were of type <code>char *</code> (say you declared <code>char *name</code>), you could assign it with a string literal.  But the meaning is different:  It would make <code>name</code> point to the string literal <code>"magadh"</code>.  You could not modify the contents of this string since it was a string literal.  For example, the following would result in undefined behaviour:</p>

<pre><code>char *name = "magadh";
name[0] = 'n';  /* &lt;-- undefined behaviour */
</code></pre>

<p>One reason this bad (other than C says it is) is that you don't know where the compiler puts the <code>"magadh"</code> in memory.  It is allowed to put it in the code text section, which is not writable.</p>

<p>Notice the difference with the following:</p>

<pre><code>char name[30] = "magadh";
name[0] = 'n';  /* &lt;-- this is OK */
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>name</code> here resides on the stack as a local variable.  It is an array of <code>char</code>, which is given its value (initialized) when the array is allocated.  You can modify it because you are allowed to modify local variables, since they are on the stack.</p>

<p>In C, there really are no "strings". They are just contiguous <code>char</code>s somewhere that (hopefully) end in a null terminator <code>'\0'</code>.  If you want to "assign" one (as in your line 2 and 3), you have to explicitly say to copy <code>char</code>s from source to destination, beginning to end.  This is what the <code>strcpy()</code> library function is for.</p>
