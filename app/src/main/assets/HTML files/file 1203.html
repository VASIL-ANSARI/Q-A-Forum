<p>From your php script, you could launch another script (using <code>exec</code>) to do the processing. Save status updates in a text file, which could then be read periodically by the parent thread.</p>

<p>Note: to avoid php waiting for the <code>exec</code>'d script to complete, pipe the output to a file:</p>

<pre><code>exec('/path/to/file.php | output.log');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you can fork a script using the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.php" rel="nofollow">PCNTL</a> functions. This uses one php script, which when forked can detect whether it is the parent or the child and operate accordingly. There are functions to send/receive signals for the purpose of communicating between parent/child, or you have the child log to a file and the parent read from that file.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php" rel="nofollow">pcntl_fork</a> manual page:</p>

<pre><code>$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
     die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
     // we are the parent
     pcntl_wait($status); //Protect against Zombie children
} else {
     // we are the child
}
</code></pre>
