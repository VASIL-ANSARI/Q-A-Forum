<p>It sounds like you really want to use a QTreeView with a custom QAbstractItemModel. Yes, that may look a bit scary, if you have never done this before, but the key advantage is that in this approach, the view will ask you for item data, if and when it is needed, without you having to pre-fill it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, do consider the advice given by Michael Boone: Instead of deleting all child items, then re-adding them, why don't you just check whether child items have already been added (optionally updating them, if required)?</p>
