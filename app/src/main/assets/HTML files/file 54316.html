<p>Here's how I do it:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint location = [touch locationInNode:self];
    [self handleTouchedPoint:location]; // Cleans 'touchesBegan' method by carrying over needed code elsewhere.
}

/** Handle touches. */
- (void)handleTouchedPoint:(CGPoint)touchedPoint {
    SKNode *touchedNode = [self nodeAtPoint:touchedPoint];

    // Detects which node was touched by utilizing names.
    if ([touchedNode.name isEqualToString:@"God"]) {
        NSLog(@"Touched world");
    }
    if ([touchedNode.name isEqualToString:@"Tiles"]) {
        NSLog(@"Touched map");
    }
    if ([touchedNode.name isEqualToString:@"Player Character"]) {
        NSLog(@"Touched player");
    }
    if ([touchedNode.name isEqualToString:@"Test Node"]) {
        NSLog(@"Touched test node");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. 'Test Node' is an SKSpriteNode created within my Player class (which is also a SKSpriteNode) to test if touches still work on it. They do.</p>
