<p><p>It seems that you mean you have to run this code block again and again just for evaluating result that is already choosed. If this is the truth, and you can't split the showOpenDialog() thing with if...else... thing, you can define a varible belong to your class, which name can be "IsChoosed"(boolean), and then doing like this: </p>

<pre>

    if(IsChoosed == <b>false</b>) {
        result = jFileChooser1.showOpenDialog(this);
        IsChoosed = <b>true</b>;
    }

</pre>
