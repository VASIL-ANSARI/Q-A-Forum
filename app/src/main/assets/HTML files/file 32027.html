<p>I don't seem to be able to open your JS bin to do some sort of profiling but looking at your code doing recursion within a foreach loop is probably the source of the problem. </p>

<p>I think you should look at triggering the fixsizes() after the window has stopped resizing (using a timeout/similar) and also look into manipulating the widths of the images off the DOM using <code>detach()</code>.</p>
