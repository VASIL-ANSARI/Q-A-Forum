<p>Your code should work as long as <code>number</code> isn't zero. To handle that case as well, simply do a type check like this:</p>

<p><code>if (typeof req.object.get('number') !== 'number')</code>. </p>

<p>It seems like you are confusing java and javascript. Javascript does not have ints or integers, only numbers. Javascript variables do not have types and all variables can be <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. </p>
