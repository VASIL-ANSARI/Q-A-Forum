<p>The standard C++ library doesn't define any access to thread priorities. To set thread attributes you'd use the <code>std::thread</code>'s <code>native_handle()</code> and use it, e.g., on a POSIX system with <code>pthread_getschedparam()</code> or <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code>. I don't know if there are any proposals to add scheduling attributes to the thread interface.</p>
