<p>You can use your own forms, but it is better to use django forms because it provides more customization and flexibility.</p>

<p>It is easy to change the type of "widget" rendered with very little code change when you use django forms. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class MyForm(forms.Form):
    my_field = forms.ChoiceField(choices=CHOICES) #choices can be a tuple
</code></pre>

<p>Would render as a checkbox field.
If you want to render the same as a Radio button, all you would have to do is:</p>

<pre><code>class MyForm(forms.Form):
    my_field = forms.ChoiceField(widget=forms.RadioSelect, choices=CHOICES)
</code></pre>

<p>You would have to manually change the entire code if you have your own form. </p>

<p>You can also do some custom field level validation on the server side in one pass (Example, check if username is unique) - You can achieve the same in a custom form, but you will have to handle every scenario yourself. </p>

<p>Also, django has <code>ModelForms</code> which would be a replica of the Model object - that tremendously reduces the amount of work that needs to be done for validation, and form processing. </p>
