<p>The easiest method is to get a proper certificate, with a correct DN and signed by a public CA, on each machine on which you are deploying the service. It's bureaucratic and annoying and probably costs real money, but it is definitely <em>easiest</em> overall.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you have to configure the clients to have a verifier that doesn't actually verify. That's dangerous, since <strong>anyone at all</strong> (including random hackers, organised criminals and dodgy government agencies) can make a self-signed certificate and there's no practical way to detect that they have done so. Except by going through and distributing to <em>every</em> client the entire list of server certificates that will <em>ever</em> be used (allowing the verifier to do its check using the club doorman technique: âif you're not on the list, you're not coming inâ).</p>

<p>The verifier is technically going to be some kind of instance of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager.html" rel="nofollow"><code>X509TrustManager</code></a>.</p>
