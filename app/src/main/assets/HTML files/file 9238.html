<p>You need to give your animation context. for example when you have this block</p>

<pre><code>$('.arrowUp').click(function(){
    $('#thumbsContainer').animate({top: '-='+93+'px'}, {duration: 1000});
    cont++;
    arrowsThumbs();
});
</code></pre>

<p>your asking it to animate #ThumbsContainer but there are multiple ones. You might want to do something like</p>

<pre><code>$('.arrowUp').click(function(){
    $(this).parent('#thumbsContainer').animate({top: '-='+93+'px'}, {duration: 1000});
    cont++;
    arrowsThumbs();
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>I would abstract it a bit more than that obviously, but i hope this gives you a better idea of why its not working</p>
