<p>You can only upload a .ipa file to diawi for distribution.</p>

<p>You can find the steps to create an IPA file from the link below</p>

<p>Also try building with AdHoc provisional profile. If the issue persists then try refreshing the page and do the upload again.</p>

<p>In my past experience diawi has shown some browser specific issues also. So try using different browsers also.</p>

<p>Hope it helps....</p>
