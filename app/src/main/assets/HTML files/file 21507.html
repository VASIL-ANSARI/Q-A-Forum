<p>Since some ADT-Version you have to set which libraries / projects should be exported too.</p>

<p>Project-Propiertes -> Java Build Path -> Order and Export -> Check your Sources and other Libraries you are using.</p>

<p>Do these Export-Settings for your Core- and Android-Project.</p>

<p>Then it should work fine on Android.</p>
