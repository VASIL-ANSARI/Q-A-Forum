<p>All by itself without any other PHP code on the page, it is useless and will almost certainly cause an error.</p>

<p>In most cases however, you have a function or control structure somewhere on the page and this is just a closing brace.</p>

<p><strong>E.g.</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
      if (someCondition) {
?&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;Some title only shown if PHP condition is met.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
</code></pre>
