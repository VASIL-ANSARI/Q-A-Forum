<p>More important than the question of atomic vs. nonatomic is that getters aren't guaranteed to be pure or idempotent. Calling a getter multiple times may not be equivalent to calling it once. For example, <code>someNSEnumerator.nextObject</code> will return a different result every time you call it. So such an optimization is not possible in the general case.</p>

<p>However, with regards to "faster," I doubt either code snippet will be appreciably faster. The correct answer is to profile and see if it makes any difference if this code is running often enough to be worth the trouble.</p>
