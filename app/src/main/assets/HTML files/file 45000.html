<p>It looks like you want an instance per thread.</p>

<p>There or out of the box solutions for this, the DI containers like Guice, spring and many other.</p>

<p>If you really want to do this yourself, you could use a map the keep an instance per thread.</p>

<pre><code>public class Abc {

    private static Map&lt;Long, Abc&gt; instances = new HashMap&lt;Long, Abc&gt;();

    //hiding the constructor
    private Abc() { }

    public static Abc getInstance() {
        Long threadId = Thread.currentThread().getId();
        if (!instances.containsKey(threadId)) {         
            instances.put(threadId, new Abc());
        }
        return instances.get(threadId);
    }

}
</code></pre>
