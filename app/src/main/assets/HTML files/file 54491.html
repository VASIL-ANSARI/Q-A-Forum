<p>your addValue method looks like it is incorrect. it only modifies the root, then character will be equal, so it returns. In particular d is never modified.</p>

<p>On a more fondamental level, a BST would be appropriate to look for a character in a tree, not for looking for a String. If you want to look for a word, you can use a Trie instead (which is not a binary tree).</p>
