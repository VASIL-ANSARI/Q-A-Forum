<p>To have a bundle for the blog : OK, to have a bundle for blog articles and an other one for the comments that's very very bad. So, you can create a setting page for your bundle of course, and you can have the core of your application who is creating the links between each of this pages. </p>

<p>But if you need settings on your page which is on different bundles, your application has a bad structure. To a functionality, use services, to a set of functionality which are linked together, use a bundle.</p>

<p>---- EDIT
Your bundles have to have a setting page in his its own bundle. You can add them easily with twig but you will always need to do this template yourself (and that's normal) to create your setting's page. If you have a parameter used by more than one bundle, you can just register this parameter in the same place and cut your template to have a block for each parameter, and just include the one you need on your full template. </p>

<p>But that's weird, in my opinion, one setting page per bundle is a good way, and redundant parameter is bad, because today you want the same setting to sort the comments for blog and forum, but tomorrow, perhaps you would like to have a difference between them.</p>

<p>That's my point of view, not the "solution" ;)</p>
