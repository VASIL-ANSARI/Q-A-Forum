<p>The only way that I can think to do this would be to create different apps with separate names and Bundle IDs for each country, and then set each app to only be available in the country that you created it for. This is, however, against Apple's Guidelines (see comment below).</p>

<p>Realistically, you should develop one app that supports multiple languages and locations and make it available in the countries you intend to provide content for. </p>
