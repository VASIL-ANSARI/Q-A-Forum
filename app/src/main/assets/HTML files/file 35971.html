<p>It is explicitly stated that with in-process SLAB, all configuration is performed in code, while when using the SLAB out-of-process, all configuration is performed in an xml config file.
So, what you need is not supported out of the box and you can only do it by writing all the plumbing yourself, an example of which I am yet to encounter. It is obvious that SLAB is primarily meant to be used out-of-process so it can use Event Tracing for Windows infrastructure (which it won't do if you use it in-process). However, the last docs I encountered state that the out-of-process SLAB is not yet considered production-ready... quite strange from Microsoft.</p>
