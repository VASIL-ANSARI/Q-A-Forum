<p><code>GROUP BY</code> on multiple columns is possible. Depending on the result you want, you have to apply extra <code>GROUP</code> functions to the rest of your data. In your case it looks like you want the first <strong>column1</strong> index, and unique combinations of <strong>(column2,column3)</strong></p>

<p>The following query should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MIN(column1) AS column1,column2,column3
FROM table1
GROUP BY column2,column3
ORDER BY MIN(column1) ASC;
</code></pre>
