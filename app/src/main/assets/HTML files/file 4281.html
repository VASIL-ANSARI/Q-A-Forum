<p>I had a similar problem with the <em>UIDatePicker</em> not matching my requirements exactly (in my case I needed a datepicker without a year wheel). Having a look at the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIDatePicker_Class/Reference/UIDatePicker.html" rel="nofollow">UIDatePicker reference</a>, it doesn't look like you can disable the today entry, so you might be forced to do what I did.  </p>

<p>I used a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIPickerView_Class/Reference/UIPickerView.html" rel="nofollow">UIPickerView</a> and re-implemented the date selection functionality I needed with that.  There are a few things you will need to do to implement your custom date picker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Reference/UIPickerViewDataSource_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">UIPickerViewDataSource</a> to set up row titles, dimensions and row counts.</li>
<li>Implement a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIPickerViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/UIPickerViewDelegate.html" rel="nofollow">UIPickerViewDelegate</a> to handle events from your custom picker.</li>
<li>Make sure you update your day wheel when the month wheel changes so you get appropriate days for each month.  UIDatePicker does this pretty seamlessly. With limited time, I just reload the picker when the month changes so the day counts match up.</li>
</ul>
