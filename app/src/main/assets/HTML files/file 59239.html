<p>You may know the <code>open()</code> function. With this function you can open a file like this: </p>

<pre><code>open('text.txt', 'a')
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter 1 is the file and parameter 2 is the mode (r for read only, w for write only and a for both and appending)</p>

<p>So to read the open file line by line :</p>

<pre><code>file = open('text.txt', 'a')
lines = file.readlines()
for line in lines:
    name, pass = line.split(',')
    if name == 'whatever':
    #...
</code></pre>

<p>And finally to write to the file you've got the <code>write()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>file.write(name + ',' + pass)
</code></pre>

<p>I think that will help you to complet your programme. :)</p>
