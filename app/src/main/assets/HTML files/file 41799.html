<p>The reason the image button is not aligned, is because the content inside it is larger than text, there are two solutions to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decrease the height of the image inside the button </li>
<li>Increase the height of the text buttons by manually calculating the height of the image button and matching it (which can be achieved by <code>height:100px</code> in <code>.mybuttons</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding the second problem (same width), set <code>width: 90px;</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>.myButton</code> can achieve same width across buttons (change the 90 to whatever number you feel is best).</p>
