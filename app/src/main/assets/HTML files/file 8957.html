<p>You can't simply create a string from arbitrary bytes - the bytes must be encodings of characters in the encoding you are using (in your case, the default encoding). If you use bytes that don't map to a character, they will be mapped to <code>'?'</code>. The same is true in the other direction: If you have a string with characters which do not map to bytes, the <code>getBytes()</code> method will map them to <code>(byte)'?'</code>.  I think one or both of this happened here.</p>

<p>If you are using JPG or a similar lossy image format, it will change the bytes of your image during saving.</p>
