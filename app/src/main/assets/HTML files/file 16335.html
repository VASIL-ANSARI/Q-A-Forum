<p>You'd have to execute a dynamically concatenated SQL string, which unfortunately would compromise whatever benefits parametrized SQL had afforded you to begin with.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1325044/dynamic-sql-passing-table-name-as-parameter">this post</a>.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @SQL varchar(250)
SELECT @SQL = 'Select * From ' + @TableName + ' Where ' + @param + ' = 1'
Exec(@SQL)
</code></pre>

<p>Not advisable, if you can predetermine the table name through some other means instead.</p>
