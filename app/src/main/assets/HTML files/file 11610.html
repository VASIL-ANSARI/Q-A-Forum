<p>That's because there isn't a clean solution...they're all hacks. see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111204163859/http://abcoder.com/css/css-equal-height-columns" rel="nofollow">abcoder</a></p>

<p>You can use javascript/jquery,</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
    var maxheight = Math.max.apply(null,$('.col').map(function () {
        return $(this).height();
    }));
    $('.col').height(maxheight);
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mnbayazit/4gLWB/" rel="nofollow">js fiddle</a> -- uses <code>box-sizing</code> so that I could put some padding on the columns, but isn't strictly necessary.</p>

<p>Or you can wrap all your divs in another div, and then use a vertically-tiled background on the containing div to give the appearance that they're separate columns, even though the inner divs don't extend all the way down.</p>

<p>Tables or emulated tables (using CSS) will also work.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> there may be some solutions involving CSS3 these days, however. This answer is from 2011, so use your judgement.</p>
