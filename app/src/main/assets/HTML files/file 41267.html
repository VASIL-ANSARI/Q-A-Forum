<p>The compiler doesn't know that the values inside the <code>switch</code> cannot exceed 3 or be less than 0.</p>

<p>Hence, you have to tell the compiler what to do in situations where it is. The easiest way is to add a <code>default</code> clause to your <code>switch</code>. I prefer an <code>Exception</code> over returning a default value, since it makes clear that actually something went wrong:</p>

<pre><code>case 3:
{
    ...
}
default:
{
    throw new Exception("I totally didn't expect this.");
}
</code></pre>
