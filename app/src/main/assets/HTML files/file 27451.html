<p>You have two types of annotations, but you are only setting the image when the annotation is originally created. Thus, if an annotation for a bar scrolls off the map view and another annotation for a club scrolls on, it might reuse the bar's annotation view for the club.</p>

<p>There are two ways of fixing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use different <code>reuseIdentifier</code> parameters for each of the two types of annotation views; or</p></li>
<li><p>Set/reset the annotation view's <code>image</code> regardless of whether your call to <code>dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier</code> succeeded in returning a value or not.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Unrelated, but your <code>viewForAnnotation</code> method should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You might want to use <code>isEqualToString</code> instead of <code>isEqual</code> when checking for <code>@"Bar"</code> vs <code>@"Club"</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to return <code>nil</code> if neither of those <code>if</code> clauses return true (this should never happen, but nonetheless you have a potential path in this routine in which you neglect to return any value). I would guess that this would have been brought to your attention if you ran the code through the static analyzer ("Analyze" on Xcode's "Product" menu).</p></li>
<li><p>A more subtle observation, but I'd probably not rely upon the annotation's <code>subtitle</code> for determining which annotation view to employ, but rather either</p>

<ul>
<li><p>have two annotation subclasses, one for bars and one for clubs; or </p></li>
<li><p>have a custom property in your existing <code>Annotation</code> class that indicates whether it's a bar or club (and I'd probably use an <code>enum</code> for that).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At some future date, you might want to use the callout's subtitle for something other than "Bar" vs "Club" (e.g., maybe the address of the bar/club?), and the current model seems to conflate a UI attribute (i.e. what shows up in the callout) with a state property (i.e. a variable that controls which annotation view type to use). Not a big deal, but just an suggestion.</p></li>
