<p>It's been a long time since I've coded C, and I'm sorry to answer and not comment (not enough points), but perhaps <code>mysql_fetch_field_direct()</code> (<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-fetch-field-direct.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-fetch-field-direct.html</a>) might be of help?</p>
