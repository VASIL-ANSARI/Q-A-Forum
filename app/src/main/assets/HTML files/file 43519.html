<p>One option would be using the <code>--rerun-tasks</code> flag in the <a href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_command_line.html" rel="nofollow">command line</a>. This would rerun all the the test task and all the tasks it depends on.</p>

<p>If you're only interested in rerunning the tests then another option would be to make gradle clean the tests results before executing the tests. This can be done using the <code>cleanTest</code> task. </p>

<p>Some background - the Java plugin defines a clean tasks to each of the other tasks. According to the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>cleanTaskName</em> - Deletes files created by specified task. cleanJar will delete the JAR file created by the jar task, and cleanTest will delete the test results created by the test task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, all you need in order to re-run your tests is to also run the <code>cleanTest</code> task, i.e.:<br>
<code>gradle cleanTest test</code></p>
