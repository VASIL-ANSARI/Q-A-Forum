<p>I confirm it's a bug in Hibernate Search. Here is the JIRA I just created: <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2301" rel="nofollow">https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2301</a> .</p>

<p>I already wrote a fix but I have to go and doesn't have the time to clean it up; I'll post a PR later today.</p>

<p>Thanks for spotting this issue!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> we fixed it in 5.5.4.Final: <a href="http://in.relation.to/2016/06/29/Polishing-Polishing-And-More-Polishing-Hibernate-Search-5-5-4-Final/" rel="nofollow">http://in.relation.to/2016/06/29/Polishing-Polishing-And-More-Polishing-Hibernate-Search-5-5-4-Final/</a></p>
