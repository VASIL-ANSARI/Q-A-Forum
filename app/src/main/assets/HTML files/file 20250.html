<p>There is no well-defined way, as far as I'm aware, to create an object without invoking it's constructor. This is regardless of whether you have access to its public interface or not, though you could implement a private or protected constructor if you want to restrict who can invoke it. There is otehrwise no restrictions on creating new instances of a class from its own internal methods, in fact it is quite common to define a private constructor and a static public method that create instances of said object if you want to restrict under which conditions said object can be created.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can allocated sufficient memory for an object and reinterpret_cast a pointer to that memory to a pointer of the type you want. This usually works for POD's, but since many implementations (if not all) of polymorphic inheritance in c++ adds a pointer to a vtable to polymorphic instances this approach will usually, if not always, fail for those.</p>

<p>In short, create a private constructor and have a static method invoke it and then do any other work that you need is my recommendation.</p>
