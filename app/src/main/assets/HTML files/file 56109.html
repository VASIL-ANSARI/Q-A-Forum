<p>First, it is an internet myth that the Sieve of Atkin is faster than the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The Sieve of Atkin is faster under certain constraints, but the Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster in general and is the sieve chosen by mathematicians who actually use it to investigate prime numbers.</p>

<p>Second, when the sieve gets too large to fit in memory you can <em>segment</em> the sieve. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10249801/448810">this answer</a> for details.</p>
