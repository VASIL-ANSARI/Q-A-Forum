<p>Generally, you shouldn't; instead create an <code>activity_resources</code> table. That table can allow multiple rows to reference the same activity, and use each row to store a separate resource.</p>

<pre><code>activity:
- identifier field (often an auto-increment, but perhaps "serial" in this case)
- fields for "fixed" activity data, such as: name, perhaps date started;
  basically any values all activities are expected to have in fixed quantities.

activity_resources:
- activity identifier
- resource value|data
</code></pre>

<p>If resources can be shared among multiple activities, instead have a <code>resources</code> table (that holds resources), and use the <code>activity_resources</code> table to for an M:N relationship; in this case, the table's rows will instead reference activity AND resource tables.</p>
