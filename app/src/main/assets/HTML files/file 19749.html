<p>How have you used <code>trim()</code>? It should work, by specifying what characters to trim;</p>

<pre><code>select trim(trailing '.' from `your_column`)...
</code></pre>

<p>Edit,</p>

<p>You're not referencing a column when you use <code>trim()</code>, you're pointing to a string. Remove the single quotes, or replace them with ticks (`).</p>
