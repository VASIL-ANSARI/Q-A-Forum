<p>For historic reasons, <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>, so <code>True</code> is an instance of <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>The correct way to "solve" this depends on exactly what you consider the problem to be.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want <code>True</code> to stop being an <code>int</code>, well, too bad. That's not going to happen.</li>
<li><p>If you want to detect booleans and handle them differently from other ints, you can do that:</p>

<pre><code>if isinstance(whatever, bool):
    # special handling
elif isinstance(whatever, (float, int)):
    # other handling
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want to detect objects whose specific class is exactly <code>float</code> or <code>int</code>, rejecting subclasses, you can do that:</p>

<pre><code>if type(whatever) in (float, int):
    # Do stuff.
</code></pre></li>
<li>If you want to detect all floats and ints, you're already doing that.</li>
</ul>
