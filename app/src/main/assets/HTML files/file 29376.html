<p>To see if it is installed, run:</p>

<p><code>php -i | grep pcntl</code></p>

<p>If it is present and enabled then the pcntl function are likely disabled, which appears to be the default in newer PHP 5.x installs.  To check, run:</p>

<p><code>php -i | grep disable_functions</code></p>

<p>If you see a list of pcntl_* functions, you'll need to edit your php.ini file (inside of XAMPP) and comment out the line <code>disable_functions=</code></p>

<p>I'd recommend you use <a href="http://php-osx.liip.ch/">this distribution</a> of PHP for OS X, which has current versions and I can confirm does have the <code>pcntl</code> extension.</p>
