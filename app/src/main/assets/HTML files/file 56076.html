<p>The two dates are the same - only the format differs (one is 2pm UTC the other is 10am with an offset of -4 hours = 2pm UTC too).</p>

<p>So I suppose that what you want is to have the second string in UTC time zone too. In that case you can simply set the timezone of the second DateFormat:</p>

<pre><code>DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX", Locale.ENGLISH);
dateFormat.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"));
</code></pre>
