<p>This basically means that index can be used for <code>where</code> clauses where the conditions are connected by <code>AND</code> but not <code>OR</code>.  So, an index on <code>a, b</code> and be used for:</p>

<pre><code>where a = 10 and b = 100
</code></pre>

<p>However, it cannot be used if you replace the <code>and</code> with an <code>or</code>.</p>

<p>The concept of "span" means, in essence, common subclauses.  So, MySQL might be smart enough to use the index for:</p>

<pre><code>where (a = 10 and b = 100 and c = 'a') or
      (a = 10 and b = 100 and c = 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>The index works because these have a common subclause.</p>

<p>However, the index could not be used for:</p>

<pre><code>where (a = 10 and b = 100 and c = 'a') or
      (a = 10 and c = 'b') or
      (b = 100 and c = 'c')
</code></pre>

<p>There is no common set of columns in the clauses that is also in the index.</p>
