<p>Can you please inform me how many records into you order_line table so we can figure out what appends ? Normally CommandTimeout has no effect when the command is executed against a context connection (a SqlConnection opened with "context connection=true" in the connection string).CommandTimeout is the cumulative time-out (for all network packets that are read during the invocation of a method) for all network reads during command execution or processing of the results. A time-out can still occur after the first row is returned, and does not include user processing time, only network read time.</p>

<p>For example, with a 10 second time out, if Read requires two network packets, then it has 10 seconds to read both network packets. If you call Read again, it will have another 10 seconds to read any data that it requires. (Copy from msdn). You need more explanation, bro ?</p>
