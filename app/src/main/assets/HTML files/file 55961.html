<p>In django, migrations that have not run previously, run in the order of the migration number, as displayed in the migration file name. When you try adding a new field without a <code>null=True</code>, the database throws an error as it expects some value for that column, for the existing rows. </p>

<p>Now since you know that this migration cannot be run, you create another one with <code>blank=True, null=True</code>. but, django still runs the migrations in order, again trying to run the first migration before running the second. So, you will always have to delete a wrong migration before running migrate</p>
