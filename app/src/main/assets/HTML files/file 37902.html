<p>The problem is that you are trying to start an activity from another thread which conflicts with the UI thread that it need to be called from there. also it is unnecessary to call the <code>screen.startAnimation(animFadeout);</code> within another thread.</p>

<p><strong>solution:</strong></p>

<p>you need to use your listener of the animation to start activity when the animation is done.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onAnimationEnd(Animation arg0) {
    startActivity(new Intent(getApplicationContext(),BMIcalculator.class));

}
</code></pre>

<p>and start the animation in the queue post of the <code>LinearLayout</code> so it is run synchronously </p>

<pre><code>screen.post(new Runnable() {

        @Override
        public void run() {
            screen.startAnimation(animFadeout); 

        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Dont use <strong>thread</strong> just to start an animation it is really unnecessary.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong></p>

<p>You are not really using the animation that you created but you supply the id of the linear layout it should be the animation.</p>

<pre><code>animFadeout=AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(getApplicationContext(),R.anim.fade_out);
</code></pre>
