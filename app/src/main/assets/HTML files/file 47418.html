<p>You need to pass a callback to <code>Trello.get</code>.  It doesn't return anything meaningful, but instead passes the value to the callback:</p>

<pre><code>Trello.get("members/me/boards", { fields: "id, name"}, function(err, boards) {
  console.log(boards); // got them!
  console.log(err); // if something went wrong, this will be non-null
})
</code></pre>
