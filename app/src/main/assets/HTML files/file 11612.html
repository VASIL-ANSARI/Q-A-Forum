<p>You want:</p>

<pre><code>  $sub = array();
  foreach ($data as $i =&gt; $c):
        $sub[$i] = $c;
  endforeach;
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>  $sub = array();
  foreach ($data as $i =&gt; $c) {
        $sub[$i] = $c;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Your code is invalid beacause you cannot use statements (like <code>foreach</code>) as array argument.</p>

<p>What's more, your code just copies one array into another, I don't want what's the purpose. I think you should read some good PHP manual.</p>
