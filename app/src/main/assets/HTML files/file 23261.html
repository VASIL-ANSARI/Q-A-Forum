<p>keyPaths is the bit you're missing. When you say Photos is always nil, I guess you don't really get any meaningful data? To get the places you need to specify the keyPath of @"results" on your <code>responseDescriptor</code>.</p>

<p>In a similar way, you can get the <code>html_attributions</code> by using it as the keyPath on another set of mappings and response descriptor.</p>
