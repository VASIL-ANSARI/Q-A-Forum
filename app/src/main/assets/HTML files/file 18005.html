<p>The IRC server generally does not send empty strings.</p>

<p>If you want a command to be issued once the BOT is in the channel, you should be sending it as soon as you know it's in the channel, which is at the end of the <code>/NAMES</code> list, or once you receive the <code>TOPIC</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, the syntax for PRIVMSG is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>PRIVMSG &lt;NICKNAME&gt; :&lt;MESSAGE&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Without the space after the <code>:</code>. If the recieving end is set to respond to <code>.command</code> but gets <code>&nbsp;.command</code>, that may be the problem. </p>
