<p>The events object is only known to the server and its ejs parser.</p>

<p>The client does not receive the events object in the code you provided.
It only receives an "ol" list.</p>

<p>Your could include the events object in map_head.ejs with code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var events=&lt;%- JSON.stringify(events); %&gt;;
</code></pre>
