<p>Your condition <code>if artists[x-1]==artists[x]:</code> will always be false if the first 2 artists entry are not equals since you override x with 1 for every loop iteration. Writing in the file will then never happen.</p>

<p>When using range iteration, the variable gets incremented automatically so no need to do it yourself.</p>
