<p><code>Socket</code> has a <code>getInputStream()</code> method. You would use the returned <code>InputStream</code> and read <code>myShortStreamSize</code> of bytes from it into a <code>byte[]</code>, convert that into a int/long representing your payload size and then read into another, larger, <code>new byte[payloadSize]</code>, the payload itself.</p>
