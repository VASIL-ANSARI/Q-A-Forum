<p>Please avoid to make deployment target as 4.3. use this link currently no device using 4.3. its waste of time </p>

<p>you can do with only native code or xib if you want do app with deployment target as 4.3. </p>

<p>because auto layout doesn't support 4.3 and 5.0</p>

<p>stroyboard not support 4.3</p>
