<p>I'm not nearly as comfortable with android layouts as I would like but I think it may be because of what's inside your ScrollView. You set ScrollView's parameters to wrap_content which means it will be as large as its children require. But the nested TableLayout uses fill_parent so ScrollView "inherits" that and fills up the entire screen. Once again, I make no guarantees that this is actually correct.</p>
