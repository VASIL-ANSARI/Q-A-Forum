<p><code>printf("result = %d\n", (int)res);</code>  is printing the value of res (a pointer) as a number. 
Remember that a pointer is an address in memory, so this will print some random looking 32bit number. </p>

<p>If you wanted to print the value stored at that address then you need (int)*res - although the (int) is unnecessary.</p>

<p>edit: if you want to print the value (ie address) of a pointer then you should use <code>%p</code> it's essentially the same but formats it better and understands if the size of an int and a poitner are different on your platform</p>
