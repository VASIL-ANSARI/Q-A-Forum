<p>You could create a spy object on your descendant class, call the implemented method and later ensure the not implemented one was called with <code>verify</code></p>

<pre><code>AbstractClass myInstance= Mockito.spy(myClass);
myInstance.myImplementedMethod();
Mockito.verify(myInstance).myMethod();
</code></pre>
