<p>If you are using python there are good chances you are not aiming at software performance, but you care more about being rapid and agile in development.</p>

<p>Said that, I think the comparison method is quite fair as long as your code is smart enough to avoid bias for one solution.</p>

<p>For instance, a possible improvement for the <code>yield</code>-based version could be removing the <code>range</code> function ad use the <code>xrange</code> function instead. The difference (in python 2.x) is that <code>range</code> builds a list of values (so it must allocate space in memory for it) while <code>xrange</code> builds an iterable object ranging on the given values.</p>
