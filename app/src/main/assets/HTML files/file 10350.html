<p>If you're downloading your file in HTTP,
you can use this method :</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7fy67z6d.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7fy67z6d.aspx</a></p>

<p>So you'll have to split your file in multiple temp file and then merge them.</p>

<p>But you'll have to be sure  that this feature is enabled on the server side (I don't know if it is by default).</p>

<p>And as some said, you'll gain in performance, that's why Free Download Manager is so useful : it download multiple parts of your file in the same time.</p>

<p>To do this with multi threads :</p>

<pre><code>class FileDownloader{
int Start;
int Count;
string PathTemp;
string Url;
FileDownloader(url,start,count){
url = Url;
Start =start;
Count = count;
PathTemp = Path.GetTempFileName()
}
void DoDownload(){
//do your thing with stream and request and save it to PathTemp
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is your code to initialize your downloader list :</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;FileDownloader&gt; filewonloadersList = new ListFileDownloader&gt;();
System.Net.WebRequest req = System.Net.HttpWebRequest.Create("http://stackoverflow.com/robots.txt");
req.Method = "HEAD";
System.Net.WebResponse resp = req.GetResponse();
int responseLength = int.Parse(resp.Headers.Get("Content-Length"));
for(int i = 0;i&lt;response.Length;i = i + 1024){
filewonloadersList.Add(new FileDownloader("http://stackoverflow.com/robots.txt",i,1024));
}
</code></pre>

<p>And your program will initialize X FileDownloader in a list (didn't put this logic here, I'm focusing on the thready stuff)</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Thread&gt; threadList = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();
foreach(FileDownloader aFildeDownloader in filewonloadersList)
{
    Thread aThread = new Thread(aFildeDownloader.DoDownload) //this method will be called when the thread starts
    threadList.Add(aThread);
    aThread.Start();
}


foreach(Thread aThread in threadList)
{
    aThread.Join();//will wait until the thread is finished
}
//all the downloader finished their work now you can go through your downloader list and concatenante the temps files
</code></pre>
