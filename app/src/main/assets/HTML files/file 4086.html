<p>The grid is modifying your data source directly, so the changes will be applied to "data".
The "onCurrentCellChanged" event is fired when the user changes the active/selected cell, and gets {row:currentRow, cell:currentCell} as a parameter.  To get to the cell data, you can use <code>data[args.row][grid.getColumns()[args.cell].field]</code>, assuming you are using the column.field to access the data and not a custom formatter that gets the data in some other way.</p>
