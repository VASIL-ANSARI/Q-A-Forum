<li>This is an expected behavior. The view animation does not really scale the view bounds. It only scales the image of it. Use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ObjectAnimator.html" rel="nofollow">ObjectAnimator</a> for this purpose. if you are supporting pre honeycomb i recommd Jake Wharton's <a href="http://nineoldandroids.com/" rel="nofollow">9olddroids</a> library </li>
</ol>

<p>2.As I see from here, you are trying to repeat the same animation infinitely by restarting.</p>

<p>you may do it by adding :</p>

<p><code>android:repeatCount="infinite"</code></p>

<p>and also you can use this to obtain  more seamless result :</p>

<pre><code> android:repeatMode="reverse"
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
