<p>As it says at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method
  if the data size is large or unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.stdout" rel="nofollow">file objects</a> to read the text as it is produced:</p>

<pre><code>output = p.stdout.read()
</code></pre>

<p>As long as no other pipes (e.g. stderr) fill up while you are reading, the process shouldn't be blocked.</p>
