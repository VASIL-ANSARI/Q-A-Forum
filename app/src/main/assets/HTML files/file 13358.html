<p>One event can report many touches. So you are sometimes getting "Ended!" once, because only one <em>event</em> arrived and only one touch event handler call was made - but it reported both touches ending. If you are manually handling multiple simultaneous touches (fingers), it is up to you to track each touch individually and check every touch in every event to see how many of your touches are being reported and decide what to do.</p>

<p>Apple has sample code showing how to do this by maintaining a CFDictionaryRef:</p>
