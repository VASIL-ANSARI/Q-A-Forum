<p>There is a method on <code>NSFileManager</code> that lets you easily look at mounted volumes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>- (NSArray*) mountedVolumeURLsIncludingResourceValuesForKeys:option</code> - Returns an array of URLs that identify the mounted volumes available on the computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know how this deals with stalled mounts though. You will also need to find out if these mounted volumes are network volumes or disk images.</p>

<p>If you want notifications when volumes come and go, you can use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">File System Events API</a>. It is a bit more low level but you can basically ask it to 'notify me when the structure under <code>/Volumes/*</code> changes.</p>
