<p>It doesn't look like you ever call <code>RecognizeSaidSomething()</code> from <code>SreSpeechRecognized()</code>. You create the event args:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>var said = new SaidSomethingEventArgs { Verb = 0, Phrase =
  e.Result.Text };</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn't appear that you do anything with it.</p>

<p>The <code>foreach</code> loop below that doesn't seem to serve any purpose, you test for the phrase then just break out of the loop. You don't set any variables or call any functions in that loop that I can see.</p>

<p>Then there is a <code>for</code> loop that appears to do something similar to the <code>foreach</code> loop (just in a different manner). It searches for matches to the recognized phrase, but then doesn't do anything with what it finds. It just returns.</p>

<p>I would think somewhere in the <code>SreSpeechRecognized()</code> event handler you want to call <code>RecognizeSaidSomething()</code> and pass it the <code>SaidSomethingEventArgs</code>.</p>
