<p>Short answer is yes - that is my approach. Do remember though that depending on the device OS, the data stored could be less secure. </p>

<p>I don't know if you can 100% eliminate risks, but you can reduce them.</p>

<p>I have two keys. </p>

<p>LOCALKEY which is a random hash, stored locally on the device.</p>

<p>SERVERKEY which is a hash of LOCALKEY and kept on my server.</p>

<p>When LOCALKEY reconnects to the server, the server will hash LOCALKEY and use it to find SERVERKEY. </p>

<p>If SERVERKEY is not found, then either someone has manually created a key, or its a first time connection.</p>

<p>And why do I make SERVERKEY? Why not store LOCALKEY on my server?</p>

<p>It is an added layer of security/privacy... I have worked for a client in Germany who explained some of the efforts Germany have to ensure a respect for privacy. By hashing a hash, you can 100% hand on heart say there is no direct copy of device data held on your server - and if you server is ever hacked, the ability to trace the source of the hash is at best, limited.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>
