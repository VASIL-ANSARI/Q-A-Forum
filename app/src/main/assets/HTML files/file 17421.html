<p>can you please try this plugin <a href="http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/</a></p>

<p>you can see that they have used the rating in multiple occasions, incase if your page is dynamic i would suggest you to follow a naming standard for your rating by an incremental variable and assign that as a name for the radio button in the above plugin </p>

<p>hope it helps</p>
