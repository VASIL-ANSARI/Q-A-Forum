<p>There is no difference at all, using <code>originalList.addAll(subList)</code> will do exactly the same because <code>addAll()</code> method creates an array copy of <code>subList</code> in memory and does not point to the same reference. Perhaps there was some intermediate operation in the <code>Stream</code> which was cleared and author forgot to clean-up the code.</p>

<p>Use <code>originalList.addAll(subList)</code> as there is no need to create a stream and collect it to <code>List</code>, it's just unnecessary operations. </p>
