<p>Yea, you are right, this is how works Android, by saving different pictures in particular folders (l,m,h and xh -dpi). </p>

<p>Where is your problem? </p>

<p>You want to keep images for all screen resolutions? Its too many of them.
Can you write more specific what you want achieve?</p>

<p>If you have a problem in layouts.xml, just check:</p>

<pre><code>android:scaleType="..."
</code></pre>
