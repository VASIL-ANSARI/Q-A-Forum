<p>It may help if you include the code you have for the form.</p>

<p>You'll need to include the output of this in your <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag (generated in <code>tornado.web.RequestHandler.get()</code>):</p>

<pre><code>self.xsrf_form_html()
</code></pre>

<p>If the input field is named upload_file, you can do this in the handler which handles the POST:</p>

<pre><code>file = self.request.files['upload_file'][0]
uploaded_content_type = file['content_type']
uploaded_filename = file['filename']
local_file_path = '/some/path/on/server/uploaded.file'
output_file = open(local_file_path, 'w')
output_file.write(file['body'])
output_file.close()
</code></pre>
