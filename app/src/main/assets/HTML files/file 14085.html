<p>There can be a number of things wrong with this, it is not clear from your code but look into the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that the information from <code>$this-&gt;EventoObreiro-&gt;find('all');</code> is actually sent to the view. You can do this using <code>&lt;?php echo debug($obreiros); ?&gt;</code>. If it is not sent you should verify your controller code [maybe even edit your post and add it for clarity.]</p></li>
<li><p>I don't see any <strong>Usuario</strong> in your Array so maybe try using <code>$obreiro['EventoObreiro']['key']</code> instead of <code>$obreiro['Usuario']['key']</code></p></li>
</ol>
