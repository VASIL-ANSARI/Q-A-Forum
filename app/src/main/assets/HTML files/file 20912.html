<pre><code>SELECT Players.* 
FROM 
(SELECT id_game 
    FROM Players 
    WHERE id_player = 55 
    ORDER BY id_game DESC 
    LIMIT 2) 
AS A JOIN Players ON Players.id_game = A.id_game 
WHERE id_player &lt;&gt; 55
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT. LIMIT in subqueries is not implemented in mysql yet (original post), the proposal alternative by mysql itself it is to use a query like this one, tested this time.</p>
