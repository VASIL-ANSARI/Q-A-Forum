<p>The solution to this error is pretty obvious in hindsight but the feedback from the run-time was so unhelpful that I ended up trying a lot of different things before finding the answer.</p>

<p>It's likely that <code>UnhandledException</code> is simply the first symbol from the CRT to be required at program start-up. It is an indicator that a different version of the Visual C Run-Time DLL (from a VS2015 preview) is expected by something in the project (hence the <code>__vcrt_</code> in <code>__vcrt_UnhandledException</code>).</p>

<p>In this case, it's ODE that needs to be rebuild against VS2015 RC. More generally, make sure to rebuild <em>everything</em> when upgrading to a newer version of MSVC2015.</p>
