<p>The problem is that the connections are not loaded i.e. the NIB is not loaded yet. You should probably declare a property that you can set and later in <code>viewDidLoad</code> set the property to the text field.</p>

Based on the log output, it looks like your outlets aren't connected properly. At least, <code>playerText</code> isn't connected properly as it is <code>nil</code>. You will have to recheck that connection.
