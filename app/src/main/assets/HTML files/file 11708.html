<p><code>PRIOR</code> is a part of condition, not of <code>CONNECT BY</code> clause. You need to qualify each parent field with it. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM emp
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp.type = emp.parenttype AND PRIOR emp.ID = emp.ParentID
START WITH emp.ID = ??? AND emp.type = ???
</code></pre>
