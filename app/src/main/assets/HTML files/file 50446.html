<p>Nope, it's showing you the source of the constructor is being called by <code>this(weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks)</code>... and that's the <em>single-parameter</em> constructor which just assigns to the <code>salary</code> variable.</p>

<p>Think of the code as being like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Constructor X
public Employee(int weeklySalary, int numberOfWeeks)
    : this(weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks)
{
}

// Constructor Y
public Employee(int annualSalary)
{
    salary = annualSalary;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the documentation as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The expression <code>this(weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks)</code> in constructor X indicates a chained call to constructor Y.</p>
</blockquote>
