<p>I think this is the wrong forum for this kind of questions but anyway.</p>

<p>First try:</p>

<p>1) Remove the initialization of the quizScores
2) Initialize the seed using srand(time(NULL)); Remember to include time.h
2) Make a double for loop for initializing the elements using rand()%100. This will give random numbers between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>With the menu, I would suggest using a while look and query for actions using getchar()</p>
