<p>I haven't had a chance to test this yet, but this might be what you're looking for. It's possible that you need to dynamically add the trigger at Page_Init. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Init()
    {
        AsyncPostBackTrigger trigger = new AsyncPostBackTrigger();
        trigger.EventName = "SelectedIndexChanged";
        trigger.ControlID = GridView1.UniqueID.ToString();
        UpdatePanel1.Triggers.Add(trigger);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Try adding that to your code-behind contemporary to Page_Load() and removing the trigger from your mark-up.</p>
