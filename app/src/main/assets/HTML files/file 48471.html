<p>In <code>btnCancel_Click</code> you must pass the cancellation request to your worker object; otherwise, it will never be notified. The <code>BackgroundWorker.CancelAsync()</code> does not do anything just simply sets the <code>BackgroundWorker.CancellationPending</code> property, notifying <em>the consumer of the BackgroundWorker</em> (the UI, not the executed task) that your task has been cancelled.</p>

<p>So what you need:</p>

<pre><code>MyObject myObject;

// This method is executed on the worker thread. Do not access your controls
// in the main thread from here directly.
private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    myObject = new MyObject();

    // The following line is a blocking operation in this thread.
    // The user acts in the UI thread, not here, so you cannot do here
    // anything but wait.
    myObject.DoWork();

    // Now DoWork is finished. Next line is needed only to notify
    // the caller of the event whether a cancel has happened.
    if (backgroundWorker1.CancellationPending)
        e.Cancel = true;

    myObject = null;
}

private void btnCancel_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   if (backgroundWorker1.IsBusy)
   {
       backgroundWorker1.CancelAsync();

       // You must notify your worker object as well.
       // Note: Now you access the worker object from the main thread!
       // Note2: It would be possible to pass the worker to your object
       //        and poll the backgroundWorker1.CancellationPending from there,
       //        but that would be a nasty pattern. BL objects should not
       //        aware of the UI components.
       myObject.CancelWork();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And how should you implement the notification:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyObject
{
    // normally you should use locks to access fields from different threads
    // but if you just set a bool from one thread and read it from another,
    // then it is enough to use a volatile field.
    private volatile bool isCancelRequested;

    // this will be called from the main thread
    public void CancelWork()
    {
        isCancelRequested = true;
    }

    // This method is called from the worker thread.
    public void DoWork()
    {
        // Make sure you poll the isCancelRequested field often enough to
        // react to the cancellation as soon as possible.
        while (!isCancelRequested &amp;&amp; ...)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
