<p>Caveat: I've never used timidity.</p>

<p>It would appear that timidity needs a configuration file, and I expect that there is a hardcoded (or possibly autoconf manipulated) default location for the configuration file. Clearly, this won't work on the iPhone since your application bundle will be installed in it's own sandbox.</p>

<p>Looking here:

<p>It would appear that using the timidity utility you can pass in a configuration file (-c) or a path to search (-L). You will need to call the equivalent functionality in your port and at runtime use something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *bundlePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath];
</code></pre>

<p>To pull out the location of where you've put the config file and soundfont files.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
