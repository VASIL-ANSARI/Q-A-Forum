<p>You can do the following: </p>

<pre><code>//Get your string   
String dt=q.showquestionpapeda(i);
// First split on basis of '/'
String [] firstSplit = dt.split("/");
// Get the second element consisting of "Answer1,Answer2,Answer3" string and split based on ","
String [] secondSplit = firstSplit[1].split(",");

//get the radio group and set the text of first second and third radio button
RadioGroup rbtnGrp = (RadioGroup)findViewById(R.id.radioGroup1);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; rbtnGrp.getChildCount(); i++) {
    // setting the text on the three children with three strings in the array
    ((RadioButton) rbtnGrp.getChildAt(i)).setText(secondSplit[i]); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set the text outside loop for each of them individually. Hope this helps.</p>
