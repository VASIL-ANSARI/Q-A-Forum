<p>If you want to avoid the conversions, you could create setter methods, instead of using the property setter:</p>

<pre><code>void SetProperty(int value);
void SetProperty(String value);
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to go wild, you could create a <code>PropertyValue</code> type with implicit conversions from ints, strings and whatever types you want, and use that as the property type. It'll make the setter behave like you want, but you're going to have a problem with the getter. If you really want to save those conversions, use the first solution.</p>
