<blockquote>
  <p>Bundles must continue to support any devices previously supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The only option</strong> for you is to create a new bundle ID and submit your app with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Removing your app from the store, and uploading the update with a
  different bundle ID, will allow you to narrow the range of devices
  your update supports. However the update will be listed on the store
  as a separate app.</p>
