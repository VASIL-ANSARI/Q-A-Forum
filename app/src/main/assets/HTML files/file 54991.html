<p>If you use the default output formatter (TextOutputFormat) Hadoop will call the <code>toString()</code> method on the object when it writes it to disk. This is expected behavior. The <code>context.write()</code> is being called, but its the output format that's controlling how the data appears on disk.</p>

<p>If you're chaining jobs together you would typically use <code>SequenceFileInputFormat</code> and <code>SequenceFileOutputFormat</code> for all of the jobs, since it makes reading the output from one job into a subsequent job easy.</p>
