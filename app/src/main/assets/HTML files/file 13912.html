<p>Your program doesn't have any output, so there would be none.</p>

<p>It also never initializes the <code>sTest</code> pointer to point at some valid memory, so the results are totally undefined. This program invokes undefined behavior, and should/might/could crash when run.</p>

<p><em>IF</em> the pointer had been initialized to point at a valid object of type <code>struct test</code>, the fields of that structure would have been changed so that at the end of <code>main()</code>, <code>ID</code> would be 3. The changes done inside <code>changePointer()</code> are done on the same memory as the changes done in <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>An easy fix would be:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void)
{
   struct test aTest;
   sTest = &amp;aTest;    /* Notice the ampersand! */
   sTest-&gt;start = true;
   changePointer(sTest);

   return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that C before C99 doesn't have a <code>true</code> keyword.</p>
