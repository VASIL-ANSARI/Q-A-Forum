<p>It will depend on the version of select2 that you are using.
The html structure changed in one of the versions.  </p>

<p>Here is Fiddle example:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/LpjcqbLu/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/LpjcqbLu/</a></p>

<p>I just put the 'error' class on the select box.</p>

<pre><code>.error + .select2-container, 
.error + .select2-container + .select2-container .select2-dropdown {
    border: 3px solid red !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In earlier versions, the dropdown was not close to the select box (in the dom), so you would have to do a javascript solution to apply the error class directly.</p>
