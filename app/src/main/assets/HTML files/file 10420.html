  <p>In python, <code>list.index(a)</code> will return any index for which <code>a == list[index]</code> is true. But I need to find the index for which <code>a is list[index]</code>, and do so as quickly as possible (speed is vital).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if <code>list.index()</code> worked that way, you wouldn't get much benefit from that.  Since there is no character type in Python, you should store your characters as integers, not as one-character strings.  Integers are compared the same way for <code>==</code> and <code>is</code>.</p>

  <p>I have some text in which I must be able to insert/remove characters very quickly. Therefore, I use a list of the characters (about a million) instead of a string.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Storing characters in a list is <em>not</em> a way to allow for fast insertions and deletions.  A Python list is a dynamic array, not a linked list, so that adding or removing items is O(n).  For example, if you want to remove the <code>5</code> in <code>range(10)</code>, items <code>6</code> to <code>9</code> need to be moved to the left by one position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, after any given insert/remove operation at an index, I must very quickly know how many newline characters precede that index.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would suggest that you keep the indices of newline characters in a separate data structure, and update this every time you add or remove a newline character.  Otherwise you will always have to scan the entire list up to the current point.</p>

<p>Due to Python beeing a very high-level language, I doubt that you can get really good performance for your problem in plain Python, though.</p>
