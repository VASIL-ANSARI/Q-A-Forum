<p>I'm not sure if I understand perfectly your question, but if you just need to write a class for it. You can do that in different ways.. </p>

<p>1) if you want a class that is specific for float values, you could do something like this, is really simple but is just to show you an example..</p>

<pre><code>class MyFloat{
    float _num;
public:
    MyFloat(float f = float()) : _num(f){}
    float getMyFloat() const{ return _num; }
    void setMyFloat(float b) { _num = b;}
};
</code></pre>

<p>2) if you want to have a class which will solve or handle whatever data type, then you will be looking in a template class that will look like this..</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class MyFloat{
    T _num;
public:
    MyFloat(T f = T()) : _num(f){}
    T getMyFloat() const{ return _num; }
    void setMyFloat(T b) { _num = b;}
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your implementation, you just create an object using your class, in this case MyFloat..</p>

<pre><code>vector &lt;MyFloat&gt; num; // this will be an object that could handle float values or any type     depending which class you choose to use
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it helps, even tho your question was not too clear.. :)</p>
