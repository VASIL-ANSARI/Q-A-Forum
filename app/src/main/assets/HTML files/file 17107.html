<p>First of all, your HTML is not valid. The <code>paraclass</code> attribute must be renamed to <code>data-paraclass</code> in case you're developing with HTML 5, or add a namespace if you're developing with XHTML.</p>

<p>Second, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is not thought to be displayed as a list. Therefore I'd like to encourage you to use the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element, since it is designed especially for this purpose and supported by all browsers.</p>
