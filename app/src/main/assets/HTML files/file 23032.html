<p>The crop method you're using in this line:</p>

<pre><code>        Intent cropintent = new Intent("com.android.action.CROP");
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't supported by all android devices. I have this same problem and I'm working on solving it for myself as well, now.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Your problem might just be you forgot camera:</p>

<pre><code>        Intent cropintent = new Intent("com.android.camera.action.CROP");
</code></pre>
