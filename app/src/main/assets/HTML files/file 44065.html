<p>You can't have things like <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> inside a script. To the parser, that means the script has ended. So it includes an automatic <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> because that's the proper thing to do!</p>

<p>Solution: don't put <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> in your script. Write <code>&lt;\/div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Oh, and remove the <code>type=""</code>, which is wrong.</p>
