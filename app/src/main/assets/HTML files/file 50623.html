<p>I think what you need is not usually done using shell script.</p>

<p>You can write a <code>c code</code> to generate your input, which in this case is numbers from 1-10000. Let that file be testGenerator.c. Then, run this on your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>gcc testGenerator.c
./a.out &gt;input
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a file, named <code>input</code> which will have numbers from 1 to 10000, which is of course the o/p of testGenerator.c.</p>

<p>Then, if your program, in which you want input is compiled into <code>a2</code>, as I can see, you can run it as:</p>

<pre><code>./a2 &lt;input &gt;output
</code></pre>

<p>and you will get the required output in the file <code>output</code>. If you don't write <code>&gt;output</code> here, you will see o/p on terminal.</p>

<p>Also, when you are running this script, you are actually running the <code>a2</code> 10000 times and giving a number as command line argument, which is very different from taking input from <code>stdin</code> which of course, <code>scanf</code> does.</p>
