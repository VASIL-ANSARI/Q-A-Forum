<p>I want to sum up the comments in an answer now that everything seems to be resolved.</p>

<p>Calls between Firefox and Chrome do work as expected, but Jay was having problems when trying to run Chrome and Firefox on the same computer and make a call. This works on the machines that I have tested, but based on the error pasted in the question, it looks like one of the browsers was failing to acquire the camera; we've occasionally <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=151246" rel="nofollow">seen issues</a> with the browsers not acquiring/releasing the camera correctly, so that's likely the cause of the problem he was seeing. We will continue to try to reproduce this on different platforms and file a bug with the browsers.</p>

<p>Jay confirmed that calling between two different computers did work correctly.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was able to reproduce this on Windows. Here's the Firefox bug: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=918938" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=918938</a></p>
