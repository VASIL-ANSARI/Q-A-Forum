<p>AFAIK, REMOTE_USER is only set when the "Authorization Required" header is set and the user authenticates using http auth.</p>

<p>Most single sign on services use oAuth type tokens to log users in.  I don't think they will set the SERVER variable.</p>

<p>In either case, using http authentication isn't recommended, because it's not possible to log someone out if you notice suspicious activity.  And users can't log themselves out except by shutting the browser.</p>

<p>I'd recommend strongly that you stick with session based authentication and authorization.</p>
