<p>The code overall looks ok. </p>

<p>The only thing missing is <code>ons.bootstrap()</code>. I'm guessing you accidentally removed it at some point. Add that and you should be ready to go.</p>

<p>Here's a working <a href="http://codepen.io/IliaSky/pen/YWqpzV?editors=1010" rel="nofollow"><strong>demo</strong></a> of your code with <code>ons.bootstrap()</code> added.</p>

<p>On a sidenote - since you don't seem to be using angular right now you might be interested in checking out <a href="https://onsen.io/v2/" rel="nofollow">Onsen 2</a>. It has both an angular and a pure js version.</p>
