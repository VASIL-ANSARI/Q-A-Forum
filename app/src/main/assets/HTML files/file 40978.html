<p>Never mind, I'm an idiot. I'm pretty sure that this is not a mistake even rookie video editors could make (I am not even a rookie) but after rotating the video, due to the aspect ratio, there were black bars added to the side of the portrait video and that's why the video wouldn't fill the screen's width - because the black bars were there! Turns out that after cropping the black bars, the video stretches perfectly - just like before, but with the black bars gone!</p>
