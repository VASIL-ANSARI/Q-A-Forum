<p>After analyzing the logcat, there appears to be two problems: </p>

<ol>
<li>The requested URL was not found, that its an HTTP 404</li>
<li>You are trying to convert the received response from the http server to a Json Object. In this case since the URL was not found the server has returned an XML structure and hence can't be converted to a Json Object. </li>
</ol>

<p>These are very first problems that you'd need to address. </p>
