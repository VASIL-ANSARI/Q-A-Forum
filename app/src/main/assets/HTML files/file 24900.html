<p>Calling unchekAll() method of multiselect plugin seems to be the easiest way. As i cannot see your code, maybe you are not calling it the right way:</p>

<pre><code>$("select").multiselect("uncheckAll");
</code></pre>

<p>But now, where to call this method?</p>

<p>For cross browser consistency, i think the right way is to use the onbeforeunload handler, which is fired in all browsers as i'm aware of. So, this snippet should work in all case:</p>

<pre><code>window.onbeforeunload = function(){$("select").multiselect("uncheckAll")};
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this fix your issue?</p>
