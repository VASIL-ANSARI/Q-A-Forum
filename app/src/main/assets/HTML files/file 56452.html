<p>For some reason you're putting <code>\:</code> where <code>-</code> should be. Also, instead of <code>\s</code> you can be more specific and just use a space. You can be more specific with those kinds of things because you know exactly what the format is. Your other big problem is that you're only using <code>\w</code>, which only matches one alphanumeric character, when you should use <code>\w+</code>, matching the whole word. Lastly, your actual error is coming from the fact that you're passing in a file object instead of the string containing its contents, i.e. <code>f.read()</code>. Here's some code that should work:</p>

<pre><code>import re

f = open("wa_chat.txt", 'r')
match = re.findall(r'(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4}) (\d{2}):(\d{2}):(\d{2}): (\w+) (\w+):', f.read())
print match #or do whatever you want with it
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>match</code> will be a list of tuples since you wanted to use grouping.</p>
