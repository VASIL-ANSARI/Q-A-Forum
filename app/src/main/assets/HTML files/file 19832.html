<p>You aren't specifying the interval which happens to default to 1 minute, so it assumes you want to run the job every minute.</p>

<p>Try   </p>

<pre><code> ITrigger trigger = TriggerBuilder.Create()
    .WithDailyTimeIntervalSchedule
      (s =&gt; 
         s.WithIntervalInHours(24)
        .OnEveryDay()
        .StartingDailyAt(TimeOfDay.HourAndMinuteOfDay(13, 0))
      )
    .Build();
</code></pre>

<p>The default should be to run every day, so the OnEveryDay() isn't really needed. </p>

<p>Not sure why you are seeing local and UTC, as all my times are displayed in UTC.</p>
