<p>You can't autobox a primitive array to an "wrapper" array: an array is a totally different type! There are some quite clear use cases for autoboxing primitives.  Those use cases don't exist for arrays.</p>

<p>Your method signature asks for at least one <code>Object</code>, and you supplied one: <code>int[]</code>.  Your method signature also allows you to provide an array, which you do with <code>Integer[]</code>.</p>

<p>It's also worth pointing out that all varargs methods can be invoked with arrays of the parameter type, which is what you're doing with <code>Integer</code>.  Since <code>int</code> isn't an <code>Object</code>, your compiler treats the <strong>array</strong> as an <code>Object</code>.</p>
