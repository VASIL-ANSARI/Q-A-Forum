<p>You changed one rule: the one that links the program <code>main</code> from the object files.  And when make did that link, you can see it used <code>gcc</code>.</p>

<p>You didn't do anything to change the built-in rules that make is using to compile the object files, so they use the default (the value of the variable <code>CC</code>) which is <code>cc</code>.</p>
