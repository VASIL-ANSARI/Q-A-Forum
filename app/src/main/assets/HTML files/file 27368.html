<p>No, it could not throw <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. With JDBC4, if the <code>Driver</code> isn't registered, you'll just get an exception stating that no registered driver exists for that url. Something like</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for &lt;your url&gt;
    at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source)
    at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source)
    at ru.expbrain.flib.Main.main(Main.java:15)
</code></pre>

<p>The javadoc for <code>DriverManager.getConnection(String)</code> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DriverManager attempts to select an appropriate driver from the
  set of registered JDBC drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
