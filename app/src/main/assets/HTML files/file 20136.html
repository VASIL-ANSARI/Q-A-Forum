<p>All C++ input streams have a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream/get" rel="nofollow"><code>get</code></a> function that can be used to get one character at a time. And output streams have a corresponding <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream/put" rel="nofollow"><code>put</code></a> function.</p>

<p>Simply replace where needed.</p>

<p>Of course, the normal input and output operators <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> can be used as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to work on the arrays directly, that's easy as well, once you learn how to handle pointers. Then just pass the input and output arrays to the function, and when getting a byte use e.g. <code>left[c] = *input++;</code> and when writing use e.g. <code>*output++ = c;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can also use a standard C++ container such as <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector" rel="nofollow"><code>std::vector</code></a> for storage of the data. In this case you use e.g. <code>std::vector&lt;char&gt;</code>, and use iterators to get and set single characters.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is all actually very basic stuff, and things you should learn yourself quickly. Just read more about pointers, arrays, the C++ <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io" rel="nofollow">standard I/O functionality</a>, and the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container" rel="nofollow">standard containers</a></p>
