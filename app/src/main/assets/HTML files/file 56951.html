<p>I can think of one workaround, though I'll admit it's not the most elegant thing in the world.</p>

<p>For any worksheet that you want to save settings for, first create a binding for the "WorksheetName!A1:XFD1048576".  You will get an ID back, and this time it's unique and persisted in the document</p>

<pre><code>Office.context.document.bindings.addFromNamedItemAsync("WorksheetName!A1:XFD1048576", "matrix", function (result) {
    if (result.status == 'succeeded'){
        console.log('Added new binding with ID: ' + result.value.id);
    }
    else {
        console.log('Error: ' + result.error.message);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now create settings based off of that ID (or some mapping telling you that Sheet1 = id AFD43243DDR3232, with settings ____).</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>
