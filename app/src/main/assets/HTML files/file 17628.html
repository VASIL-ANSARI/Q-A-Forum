<p>Resolved this, but I think it is a very stupid way to achieve the result, so I am not happy with how Bootstrap handles toggles. I really don't think there is a need to loop though every <code>.accordion-group</code> to re-apply droppable attributes every single time someone opens OR closes a section.</p>

<p>Going to re-do it with just a button and a div for each section.</p>

<p>Here is the solution:</p>

<pre><code>$('#host-groups').on('shown', function() {
    $('#host-groups').find('.accordion-group').each(function() {
        $(this).attr('id').droppable();

    });
});

$('#host-groups').on('hidden', function() {
    $('#host-groups').find('.accordion-group').each(function() {
        $(this).attr('id').droppable();

    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>/facepalm</p>
