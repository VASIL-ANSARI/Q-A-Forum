<p>Never saw a problem with your second case, except the fact that in <strong>second</strong> case you didn't define a TYPE of the variable.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I think I missuderstood your question: </p>

<p>The member <code>variable</code> is a part of the base class definiton. You can not access a <em>public</em>  member of a class out of any method. That is it.</p>
