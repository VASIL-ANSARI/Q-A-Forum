<p>Create a new repository in GitHub for you new app, if you haven't already. Make that new repository as origin to your new repository:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin &lt;github_url&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the remote already exists, you might have to <code>git remote set-url origin &lt;github_url&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now, push to the repo.</p>
