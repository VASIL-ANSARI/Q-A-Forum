<p>Well the keyboard isn't going away because it doesn't expect to have to. The new UITextField is just becoming the first responder while the other resigns. If you don't want a textField to become the first responder if another is already, you're going to have to cut it off before it gets the chance to. I would try to implement textFieldShouldBeginEditing and figuring out the logic there. </p>

<p>I'm not in love with the way this looks but this should do something along those lines. </p>

<pre><code>func textFieldShouldBeginEditing(textField: UITextField) -&gt; Bool {
    for subView in self.view.subviews{
        if(subView.isKindOfClass(UITextField)){
            if(subView.isFirstResponder()){
                subView.resignFirstResponder();
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
