<p>Your declaration of your map is misplaced, it is not currently visible to <code>findCustomer</code> and <code>deleteCustomer</code> methods. Don't you have a compile error in these 2 methods?</p>

<p>You should declare it as a field above the 3 methods, like this:</p>

<pre><code>  private static Map&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = new HashMap&lt;&gt; ();

  public static void addCustomer(){
       // Customers
    customers.put ("ID1", new Customer ("Jonathan", "Mifsud", "Test Address", 21345678, "L001"));
    customers.put ("ID2", new Customer ("David", "Aguis", "2nd Address", 21456778, "L002"));
    customers.put ("ID3", new Customer ("Frank", "Mamo", "example Address", 21987653, "L003"));
  }

  public static void findCustomer(){
      //retrieve Customer Details
    System.out.println("Customer with ID1 is " + customers.get("ID1"));
  }

  public static void deleteCustomer(){
      //remove Customer Details
    System.out.println("Customer Deleted is ID3 " + customers.remove("ID3"));
  }  
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that putting everything static might not be wise, especially if you start working with a state.</p>
