<p>It seems like you are trying to implement some kind of scheduling.</p>

<p>You could try implementing one using one of SQL Server services called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189237.aspx" rel="nofollow"><em>SQL Server Agent</em></a>. It may not be fit for <em>all</em> kinds of response to time events, though, but it should be able to manage certain tasks.</p>

<p>You would need to set up a SQL Server Agent <em>job</em> for it.</p>

<p>A job would need to consist of at least one <em>job step</em> and have at least one <em>schedule</em> to be runnable. Perhaps, it would be easiest for you at this point to use the <em>Transact-SQL</em> type of job step.</p>

<p>A Transact-SQL job step is just a Transact-SQL script, a multi-statement query. In your case it would probably first check if there are rows matching the current time. Then, either for every matching row separately or for the entire set of them, it would perform whatever kind of operation Transact-SQL allows you to perform.</p>
