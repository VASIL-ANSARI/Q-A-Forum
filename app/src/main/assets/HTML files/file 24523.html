<p>The properties in <code>Enemy</code> are all <code>static</code>, which means there is only one of each of them shared between the whole application. So the next enemy, that dies straight away, will be using the life of the previous one, which is already dead.</p>

<p>Remove the <code>static</code> modifier from the <code>currEnemyLife</code>, <code>currEnemyBullets</code> and <code>currEnemyFuel</code> properties.</p>

<p>Then you'll need to change the way you modify these values in <code>Bullet</code>, as you can no longer access them directly through <code>EnemyAI</code>. I don't know much about Unity3D but after doing a little reading I think you'd need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var enemy = otherObject.GetComponent&lt;EnemyClass&gt;();
enemy.currEnemyLife -= 50f;
// etc...
</code></pre>
