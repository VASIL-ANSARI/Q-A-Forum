<p>As mentioned in the comments by @toumir, first uninstall all <code>Microsoft.Practices.*</code> packages (check your packages.config to be sure they're all uninstalled).</p>

<p>Since you're trying to use Unity with Prism 6, the <strong>only</strong> package you have to install is <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Unity/">Prism.Unity</a>. This will automatically bring in all other packages needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unity</li>
<li>CommonServiceLocator</li>
<li>Prism.Wpf

<ul>
<li>Prism.Core</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It's a good practice to only add the most specific package, as with the new project files (.NET Core, ASP.NET 5, Win10 UWP) the old packages.config file is replaced by a project.json file and NuGet v3 will take care of <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/consume/ProjectJson-Dependency">better dependency resolving</a>. As of today it's not used yet for WPF, but that shouldn't keep you from doing it "right".</p>

<p>For new <a href="https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/tree/master/Documentation/WPF">documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism-Samples-Wpf">samples</a> on Prism 6, please head over to the Prism GitHub repositories.</p>
