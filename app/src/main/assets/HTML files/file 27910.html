<p>You shouldn't be swallowing <em>all</em> types of exceptions with a <code>rescue =&gt; e</code>. That line of code should almost never exist. Your exception handler should only capture the types of exceptions it can meaningfully recover from.</p>

<p>Change your Parent so that it doesn't swallow all exceptions, and then catch them in your Child class:</p>

<pre><code>class Parent

  def commit
    # ...
  end 

end

class Child &lt; Parent
  def commit
    begin
      super
    rescue UniqueError =&gt; e
      # ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
