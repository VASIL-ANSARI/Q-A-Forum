<p>I don't think you can since FileWebRequest refer to request using the file:// uri scheme. This scheme does not involve a specific protocol (as far as I know) like http:// uri scheme involving HTTP protocol which includes headers to partially download content.</p>

<p>If you are trying to open a remote file, you may consider the use of a specific protocol like FTP which may allow you to do want you want instead of file uris.</p>
