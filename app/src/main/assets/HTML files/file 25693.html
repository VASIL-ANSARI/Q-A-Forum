<p>A new record will not obtain an id previously associated with a deleted record. <code>ABRecordID</code>s are unique in that regard. But they are not necessarily consistent over time, a couple of things can cause the id to change. The user turning on or off iCloud may cause the id to change, as may restoring the device from itunes.
That said, <code>ABRecordID</code> is still your best bet for getting a unique id for a contact. You just need to double check that things line up when using it. Apple suggests the following in the address book programming guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recommended way to keep a long-term reference to a particular
  record is to store the first and last name, or a hash of the first and
  last name, in addition to the identifier. When you look up a record by
  ID, compare the recordâs name to your stored name. If they donât
  match, use the stored name to find the record, and store the new ID
  for the record.</p>
