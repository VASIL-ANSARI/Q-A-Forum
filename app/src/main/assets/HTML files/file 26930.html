<p>Homework assignment?</p>

<p>You already have code that runs SQL queries when you are adding employees into your database. To show all the employees in your database you want to do something similar to your addEmployee method, but instead of running an INSERT sql command you want to SELECT</p>

<pre><code>        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(YOURCONNECTIONSTRING))
        {
            connection.Open();
            using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employees", connection))
            {
                using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                {
                    while (reader.Read())
                    {
                        for (int i = 0; i &lt; reader.FieldCount; i++)
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine(reader.GetValue(i));
                        }
                        Console.WriteLine();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
