<p>Is the "stop" instance variable a property?  If not, there's no particular point in setting it during the finalizer - nothing is referencing the object anymore, so nothing can query the member.</p>

<p>If you're actually releasing a resource, then having Dispose() and the finalizer perform the same work (first testing whether the work still needs to be done) is a good pattern.</p>
