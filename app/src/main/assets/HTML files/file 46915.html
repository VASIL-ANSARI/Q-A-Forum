<p>As you wrote in your comment, the many-to-many relation table has PK defined on both FK keys, so it's impossible to put there same combination twice. I would first consider if this situation should really be possible in your business model. If it should, then one way you can go is manually declaring your intermediate table and giving it artificial PK (just autoincremented int for example).</p>

<p>Then in EF you will have two one-to-many relationships (from <code>Symbol</code> and from <code>Image</code> to Intermediate table which you can call whatever - like <code>ImagesInSymbol</code> or so).
Using these collections will be less convenient but will work. And as a bonus you will be able to set another properties on this relation later (like <code>DateCreated</code>, <code>Status</code> etc).</p>
