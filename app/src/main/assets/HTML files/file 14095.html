<p>You can add a UIControl to your imageView to perform whatever selector you want in response to a single touch. Just set the background color to clear, the frame to imageView.frame, add the control as a subview of your imageView and say </p>

<pre><code>[myControl addtarget:self action:@selector(whateverYouWantToDo) forControlEvents:UIConntrolEventTouchUpInside];
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<pre><code>UIControl *myControl = [[UIControl alloc] initWithFrame:imageView.frame]; 
[myControl setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]]; 
[myControl addTarget:self action:@selector(doWork) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; 
[imageView addSubview:myControl]; 
</code></pre>

<p>then just implement the doWork method to do whatever you're trying to do. I may have misunderstood your question but if you want to perform an action when the user touches an image in your scroll view this is the way I've done it.</p>
