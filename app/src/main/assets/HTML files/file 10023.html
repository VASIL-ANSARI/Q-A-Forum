<p>Ok the technique I found is actually coming from Cocoa, so it's objective-C but you can definitely do the same in C++. </p>

<p>The solution is simply to use a PasteBoard (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/PasteboardGuide106/Articles/pbConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008101-SW1" rel="nofollow">developer.apple.com documentation</a>).</p>

<p>In the hope it helps someone ... </p>
