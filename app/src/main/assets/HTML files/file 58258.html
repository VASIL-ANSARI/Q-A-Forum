<p>Hahahah yes...angularjs is just javascript</p>

<p>You need to find out what library is parsing the cookie on the back end..if you're using express, for example, you're probably using cookieParser...you can just console.log(req.cookie), and you can see all the cookies that are sent.</p>

<p>You can set a cookie pretty simply like this document.cookie="jwt=asdlfasdf".</p>

<p>If you are setting the cookie on the server though, which you probably are, your browser will automatically set that when it receives the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header...you can read more about the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie</a></p>
