<p>You want to use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/" rel="nofollow"><code>std::string</code></a>.  It has the methods you are looking for.  It even has a <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/compare/" rel="nofollow"><code>compare</code></a> method.</p>

<p>A char array isn't an object with any methods associated with it, it's just data.</p>
