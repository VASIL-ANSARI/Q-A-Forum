<p>I would recommend  you to use either maven or gradle build system which has clear demarcation between source and test code and how it has to be used in build <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html" rel="nofollow">life cycle</a>. That means you will be able to use any test classes while "test" phase and ignore after that. You can also manage test dependencies accordingly.  </p>
