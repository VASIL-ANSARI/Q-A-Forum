<p>DataReceived is executed on a different thread.  I had problems with really fast data and this event caused me problems.  Because of that, I created one thread and read the data myself:</p>

<pre><code>while (this.serialPort.IsOpen)
{
    int b = this.serialPort.ReadByte();
    if (b != -1)
    {
        // data is good here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But like the others said, without any code sample, there isn't much we can help you with.</p>
