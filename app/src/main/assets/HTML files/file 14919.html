<p>You have a 32-bit value that you want to squeeze into the range [0,1). That requires you to be able to represent <code>2^32</code> different values in that range.</p>

<p>A <code>float</code> has 2^32` possible values <em>in total</em>. In other words, a float can never ever ever do what you need. If you return a double, you <em>might</em> be able to do this (I haven't run the numbers to determine it exactly), but otherwise, you'll have to write your own datatype which does exactly what you need.</p>

<p>But if you store that value into a float, you're going to lose precision, because it simply doesn't have enough precision in the [0,1) range to satisfy your requirements.</p>
