<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83132/what-causes-the-error-cant-execute-code-from-a-freed-script">What causes the error &quot;Can&#39;t execute code from a freed script&quot;</a></p>

<p>That error message occurs when code created by the child frame (which has since been closed) is accessed.  This means, at least, that you can't keep JavaScript functions around after the window they came from was closed; I'm not certain that applies to data objects as well, but it might.  If so, then simple storage of JavaScript objects in the top window won't work.</p>

<p>It should be possible to work around this problem by ensuring that you completely detach the data from the child window before storing it.  This can be done by having the storage function (which must be created by the parent window alone) JSON encode that data, and store the encoded string.  Retrieval would be less finicky, since the retrieved object doesn't need to be kept around longer than the child window that retrieved it.</p>
