<p>You're never populating the <code>DataSet</code> - you're <em>creating</em> a SQL command, but never executing it. You're not querying the database at all.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether you really need a <code>DataSet, to be honest - you could potentially just use a reader returned by [</code>ExecuteReader<code>][1]. Personally I'd go in that direction, as I'm not a big fan of</code>DataSet`. (Alternatively, I'd use an ORM to avoid all this low-level work...)</p>

<p>(Note that you should use <code>using</code> statements for your writer, command etc.)</p>

<p>If you really need a <code>DataSet</code>, you probably want to look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>SqlDataAdapter</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(command);
adapter.Fill(ds);
// Now your DataSet will have data in it
</code></pre>
