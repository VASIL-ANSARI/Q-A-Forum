<ol>
<li><p>if you define a variable like $var = array(); it will wipe the previous array.</p></li>
<li><p>sessions are available throughout your domain/sub-domain, so as long as you have called session_start() before you access the session variable you're covered.</p></li>
<li><p>when you say public property are you referring to the class or the method? If you want to access the method inside itself to refer to it like $this->myFunction = $object; if you want to access the method outside itself but inside the class you do it using SELF::$object = new myFunction();</p></li>
</ol>

<p>see this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151969/when-to-use-self-vs-this">When to use self vs $this?</a>
and this: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php</a></p>

<p>hope this helps.</p>
