<p>Scope in Javascript is by function. The yStart you use in the mousedown function is different than the yStart you use in the mouseup function. The mouseup function's yStart will always be zero because it is the yStart that is defined at the beginning of your script, outside the event binding. You should get rid of the "var" before yStart in your mousedown function, so instead of creating a new local variable by that name, it writes the new value to yStart and it can be used in the other function. You should also get rid of the "var" declaration in the mouseup function for the same reason.</p>
