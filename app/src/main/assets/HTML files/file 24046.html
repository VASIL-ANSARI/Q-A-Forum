<p>I can just assume some properties about your program.
When you call: </p>

<pre><code>bPos.X &lt;= p1Pos.X + p1Pos.Width
</code></pre>

<p>this checks for the center of your ball. This will not reflect the ball on its surface but on it's center point.</p>

<p>If that wasn't the strange behaviour you tried to fix, could you please clearify the behaviour you encountered? </p>
