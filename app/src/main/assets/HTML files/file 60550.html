<p>When you write <code>SELECT INTO</code> statement, the structure of the new table is defined by the attributes of the expressions in the select list, so you won't be able to get the indexes of the source table this way.</p>

<p>you should write create index in your query
<code>CREATE INDEX NewIndex ON [Results Table] (field1, field2)</code></p>
