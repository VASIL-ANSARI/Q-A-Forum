<p>I would take a look at the Step Function (<a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/animate/</a>).  Depending on the collection/object you are animating, this might be a solution to your problem.  Another good article to read is <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1856-Using-jQuery-s-Animate-Step-Callback-Function-To-Create-Custom-Animations.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1856-Using-jQuery-s-Animate-Step-Callback-Function-To-Create-Custom-Animations.htm</a>.  Hope that helps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Step Function The second version of
  .animate() provides a step option â a
  callback function that is fired at
  each step of the animation. This
  function is useful for enabling custom
  animation types or altering the
  animation as it is occurring. It
  accepts two arguments (now and fx),
  and this is set to the DOM element
  being animated. </p>
  
  <p>â¢now: the numeric value of the
  property being animated at each step
  â¢fx: a reference to the jQuery.fx
  prototype object, which contains a
  number of properties such as elem for
  the animated element, start and end
  for the first and last value of the
  animated property, respectively, and
  prop for the property being animated.
  Note that the step function is called
  for each animated property on each
  animated element. For example, given
  two list items, the step function
  fires four times at each step of the
  animation: </p>
  
  <p>$('li').animate({   opacity: .5,<br>
  height: '50%' }, {   step:
  function(now, fx) {
      var data = fx.elem.id + ' ' + fx.prop + ': ' + now;
      $('body').append('' + data + '');   } });</p>
