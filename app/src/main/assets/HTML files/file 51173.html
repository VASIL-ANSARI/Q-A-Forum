<p>The issue you are experiencing is due to the fact that <code>model.config</code> is shared among all of your model instances, since it's created at extend time and not at create time of each model instance. This is a JavaScript concept, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3638034/483616">this SO answer</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You want each model to have it's own instance of <code>config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>config: DS.attr({
  defaultValue() {
    return {
      url: '',
      connections: 5,
      request_timeout: 2000,
      //etc...
    };
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>Also, one thing to keep in mind is that since <code>config</code> is a POJO, you will not have binding if you try to create observers or computed properties based on attributes within <code>config</code>.</p>

<p>I suggest using one of the following alternatives:  </p>

<li><a href="http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin.html" rel="nofollow">http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin.html</a> embedding models (which would require a unique id for each config -- uuid) </li>
</ul>
