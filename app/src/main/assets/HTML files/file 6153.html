<p>You could use a handler for this.  Make a <code>Runnable</code> with the task to complete after 3 seconds or when the user does the task.  Post it for 3 seconds and remove callbacks if the user does whatever.  The code same below shows how to properly use the <code>Handler</code> but isn't looping to allow the user to make the action you'll have to figure that out on your own :)</p>

<pre><code>Runnable action = new Runnable(){

    public void run(){
       //...
    }
};

mHandler.postDelayed(action, 3000);
if(userDone){
  mHandler.removeCallbacks(action);
  mHandler.post(action);
}
</code></pre>
