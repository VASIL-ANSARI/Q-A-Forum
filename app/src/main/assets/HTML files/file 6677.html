<p>I would omit the INotifyPropertyChanged in a business layer. </p>

<p>If I need to, I can derive children and make them INotifyPropertyChanged, or I can make a "model" class and it can contain an instance to my business objects.</p>

<p>This also helps to separate my business layers from my other layers (presentation, data access, etc.) as well as allowing me to use said objects in my server code which does not need to know anything about INotifyPropertyChanged.</p>
