<p>Can you set a flag (a BOOL ivar) in touchesBegan to indicate that the touch began in the fire area, and if this flag is set, dont move the ship? You would re-set it at touchesEnded. </p>

<p>That sounds too simple, so I'm probably missing something.</p>

<p>I was indeed. To handle multi touch you would need an array as you guess in the question - on touches began, if the touch was in the fire zone, add it to the array, then don't allow that touch to subsequently move the ship. Remove on touches ended. I don't see anything wrong or hacky about this, except for this note in the UITouch docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A UITouch object is persistent throughout a multi-touch sequence. You should never retain an UITouch object when handling an event. If you need to keep information about a touch from one phase to another, you should copy that information from the UITouch object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the persistence seems to support what you want to do. I don't know if a different class is used in cocos2d but the principle remains the same. </p>
