<p>To answer your first question,</p>

<p>You must specify the tile provider before it is added to the map. The tile provider cannot be changed once it has been added; however, you can modify the behavior of the tile provider to return different images for specific coordinates.</p>

<p>It also requires that all images must have the same dimension.</p>

<p>The coordinate of x and y tiles in the parameters must be in the range of  [0, 2zoom - 1] inclusive.
And the zoom level of the tile will be in the range [ GoogleMap.getMinZoomLevel, GoogleMap.getMaxZoomLevel] inclusive.</p>
