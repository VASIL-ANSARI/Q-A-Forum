<p>It's just a block containing a group of statements, nothing really special although it is sometimes useful to limit the scope of a variable<sup>(a)</sup>. You can do exactly the same thing in C such as:</p>

<pre><code>int main (void) {
    int i;
    {
        i = 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><sup>(a)</sup>: Variables declared <em>inside</em> such a block are not visible outside that block, so something like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    int i = 1;
}
System.out.println (i);
</code></pre>

<p>would not be valid since the <code>i</code> "disappears" at the closing brace.</p>
