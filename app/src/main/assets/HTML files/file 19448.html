<p>The color is changed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name="MyTheme" parent="Theme.Sherlock.Light"&gt;
    &lt;item name="android:actionMenuTextColor"&gt;@color/White&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item name="actionMenuTextColor"&gt;@color/White&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the XML layout in the ABS library, you could use     </p>

<pre><code>Activity.findViewById(R.id.abs__textButton) 
</code></pre>

<p>That should return an extended version of the Android Button, which can have a custom typeface. This probably isn't a good idea because I don't think it will work on devices using a native ActionBar. You can try and see.</p>

<p>Also, you should not be using <code>R.string.something</code> as the id. You should create an id in XML and reference it using <code>R.id.something</code> or just define an int in you class.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I did some testing and if you do <code>Activity.findViewById(menuItemId)</code> on an ICS device you get a ViewGroup with an ImageButton and a Button. I can't give you their ids, but you could use getChildAt to get the Button child and apply the typeface to it. </p>
