<p>If you choose not to use the thread containment patternâthat is, if you try to pass managed objects or contexts between threads, and so onâyou must be extremely careful about locking, and as a consequence you are likely to negate any benefit you may otherwise derive from multi-threading. You also need to consider that:</p>

<p>Any time you manipulate or access managed objects, you use the associated managed object context.
Core Data does not present a situation where reads are âsafeâ but changes are âdangerousââevery operation is âdangerousâ because every operation has cache coherency effects and can trigger faulting.</p>

<p>Managed objects themselves are not thread safe.
If you want to work with a managed object across different threads, you must lock its context.</p>
