<p>Your conclusion is right.</p>

<p>Vector drawables are completely path based. This is the underlying reason for their animation because only a path is being changed. Hence they don't take text or image as input.</p>

<p>An option might be getting .svg through text(Some tool maybe?) and then convert it to xml for each language.
If you are targeting larger localization, vector drawable may not be the right approach. </p>
