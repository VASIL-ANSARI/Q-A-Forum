<p>You should just be able to set the user manually before persisting the Resources entity.</p>

<pre><code>  if ($newResourceForm-&gt;isValid()) {
    ...
    $resource-&gt;setCreatedBy($this-&gt;getUser());
    $em-&gt;persist($resource);
    $em-&gt;flush();
    ...
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Symfony makes use of the <em>$this->getUser()</em> shortcut in controllers (see <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html#retrieving-the-user-object" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html#retrieving-the-user-object</a>).  I'm assuming you only allow this form when the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Also if you are using Doctrine I would recommend using it to generate your entities and getters/setters for you, as it will generate sensible names that coincide with Symfony conventions.  For instance, your entity would end up being named 'Resource' vs. 'Resources', and your variables would be camelCased ($createdBy vs. $created_by).</p>
