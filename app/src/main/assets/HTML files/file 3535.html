<p>DDX_Control() does SubclassWindow() under the hood. SubclassDlgItem is a shortcut for SubclassWindow(GetDlgITem()). Usually (broad generalisation here) the people using SubclassWindow are the ones who picked up that habit before DDX_Control existed (pre-1995 or so?) and never really got into MFC-mode, or people who copy and paste their programs together from blog snippets left and right.</p>

<p>So, use DDX_Control() for clarity, although it will technically not make a difference if you use SubclassDlgItem().</p>
