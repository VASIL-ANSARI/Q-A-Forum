<p>Since you're refactoring, you should think about getting rid of <code>null</code> and use Java 8's <code>Optional</code>. Guava's <code>Optional</code> wouldn't be any good here because its <code>transform</code> method doesn't allow a <code>Function</code> to return <code>null</code> (and tbh, I don't know why they chose that instead of doing like Java 8 chose to do).</p>

<p>Then with Java 8, it's rather simple to use:</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;Object&gt; object = ...;
Optional&lt;Something&gt; something = object
    .map(obj -&gt; obj.getNextObject())
    .map(nextObj -&gt; nextObj.getSomething());

// Now use this instead of checking for " != null ":
if (something.isPresent()) {
  doSomething(something.get());
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not using Java 8, you can still try to implement something similar yourself, this pattern isn't really hard to implement by yourself once you have a clear API.</p>
