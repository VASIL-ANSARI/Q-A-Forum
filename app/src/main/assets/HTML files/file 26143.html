<blockquote>
  <p><em>I'm afraid, the ASPxListBox (which is the part of the ASPxComboBox) doesn't allow to set specific color for each item. 
  I suggest you to use the ASPxDropDownEdit. This control allows to put anything in its DropDownWindowTemplateContainer. 
  For example, you can put the ASPxGridView and set color for each row using the HtmlRowPrepared event handler.</em></p>
