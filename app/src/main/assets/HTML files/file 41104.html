<p>You're on the right track. You can store the values in a <code>set</code> as you're looping through the inputs, and use the <code>in</code> operator to check for membership in that <code>set</code>. See my comments alongside the following code.</p>

<pre><code>def hasNoDuplicates(values):
    currentValues = set()              # initialize an empty set
    for value in values:               # iterate over your inputs
        if value in currentValues:     # if the current value is in your set, there is a duplicate
            return False
        else:
            currentValues.add(value)   # no duplicate exists, add it to the set
    return True                        # If it made it through all the values, there were no duplicates
</code></pre>

<p>For fun, there is an easier way to do this. If the items in the <code>values</code> sequence are hashable, you can make a <code>set</code> from the whole sequence. Since by definition a <code>set</code> may not have any duplicates, if the length of the original sequence is the same length as the <code>set</code>, then all items are unique. If the <code>set</code> is shorter, there was at least one duplicate.</p>

<pre><code>def hasNoDuplicates(values):
    return len(values) == len(set(values))
</code></pre>
