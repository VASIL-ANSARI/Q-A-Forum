<p>One approach is to build a stack of tags/styles/id down to the element which you want to select.</p>

<p>From the element you want, traverse up to the nearest id element. This way you will get rid of most of the top header etc. Then build a sequence to look for.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- lots of html --&gt;
    &lt;div id="main"&gt;
       &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;
             &lt;div class="pricearea"&gt;
                &lt;table&gt; &lt;!-- with price data --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For the exmaple you would store in your db a sequence of: <strong>[id=main],div,span,div,table</strong> or perhaps <strong>div[class=pricearea],table</strong>.</p>

<p>Using styles/classes might also be used to create your path. It's your choice to look for either a tag, an attribute of a tag or a combination. You want it as accurate as possible with as few elements as possible to make it robust.</p>

<p>If the layout seldom changes, this would let you navigate to the same location each time.</p>

<p>I would also suggest you perhaps use <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack" rel="nofollow">HTML Agility Pack</a> or something similar for the DOM parsing, as the IE control is slow.</p>

<p>Screen scraping is fun, but it's difficult to get it 100% for all pages. Good luck!</p>
