<p>I would use a Canvas on top of a View. Check out this article: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#draw-with-canvas" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#draw-with-canvas</a></p>

<p>If you use that, you will put your own extended View in the place of your comment. You'll create your own version of the onDraw() method and call invalidate() when you want to redraw (ie, when the button is pressed). Add it to your XML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;com.mypackage.MyView
   id="@+id/myView"
   ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
