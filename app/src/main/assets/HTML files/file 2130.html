<p>The best way to go, I think, is </p>

<ul>
<li><p>giving the text div a <code>padding-top: xyz</code> to make space for the logo, where <code>xyz</code> is the height of the logo</p></li>
<li><p>and to <code>position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px</code> the logo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>however, I can't really think of any SEO scenario where this would give any noticeable advantage. </p>
