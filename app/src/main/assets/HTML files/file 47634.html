<p><code>addLast</code> is declared in the <code>LinkedList</code> class, but not in the <code>List</code> interface. Therefore you can only call it using variables of <code>LinkedList</code> type. However, for a variable of <code>List</code> type you can call <code>add</code> instead, since it adds the element to the end of the <code>List</code>.</p>

<p>When the compiler sees a <code>List</code> variable, it doesn't know the runtime type of the object that would be assigned to that variable. Therefore it can only let you call methods of the <code>List</code> interface. For example, you might assign to your variable an <code>ArrayList</code> instance which doesn't have an <code>addLast</code> method, so it can't let you call methods of <code>LinkedList</code> that are not declared in <code>List</code> (or a super-interface of <code>List</code>).</p>
