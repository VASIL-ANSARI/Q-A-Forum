<p>My guess is that your file did not actually open, and the <code>eof</code> bit was therefore not set.  You never test whether the file was opened successfully.  It could be that your working directory is not what you think it is, or the file is locked by another process (perhaps open in a text editor).</p>

<p>Officially, you can test <code>readFile.fail()</code> after you try opening.</p>

<p>I've found that checking <code>readFile.good()</code> is fine too - in fact you can use that as your loop condition.</p>

<p>I prefer the positive message of 'good' in my code, rather than the potentially upsetting 'fail'.</p>

<p>You should also test your stream as WhozCraig suggested in comments, when you are reading data.  You cannot assume that the operation was successful.  If it fails for reasons other than EOF, you need to know.</p>

<p>For these reasons, don't use <code>readFile.eof()</code> as your loop condition.</p>
