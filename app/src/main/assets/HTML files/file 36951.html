<p>Hardcoded strings, missing content description and so on are no errors, but <code>Lint</code> <em>warnings</em> related to usability of your application. Consult the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/improving-w-lint.html" rel="nofollow">lint docs</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>Example: you can place the same String into <code>/res/values</code> and (for example) <code>/res/values-de</code> folders. If the device language is German, the system will take the string from the folder qualified with <code>-de</code>. Hardcoding a string means it will remain the same no matter of device settings. </p>

<p>It's not an error, but <em>a matter of usability</em>. Same applies to all <code>Lint</code> warnings.</p>
