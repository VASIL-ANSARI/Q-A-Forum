<p>There are lots of cocoacontrols to perform this function in your app:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cocoacontrols.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=down%20menu">DropDown Menu Controls For iOS</a></p>

<p>But I think <a href="https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/lmdropdownview">lmdropdownview</a> is the most accurate.</p>

<p>My mistake, <a href="https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/btnavigationdropdownmenu">btnavigationdropdownmenu</a> ITS the most accurate for what you are asking (according to your screens).</p>

<p>Implementation (Swift)[See the readme for more speceific instructions, and customization]:</p>

<pre><code>let items = ["Most Popular", "Latest", "Trending", "Nearest", "Top Picks"]

let menuView = BTNavigationDropdownMenu(frame:  CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 300, 44), title: items.first!, items: items, containerView: self.view)

self.navigationItem.titleView = menuView

menuView.didSelectItemAtIndexHandler = {(indexPath: Int) -&gt; () in
            println("Did select item at index: \(indexPath)")
            self.selectedCellLabel.text = items[indexPath]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
