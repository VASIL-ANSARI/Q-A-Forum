<p>Very close indeed. You are just overwriting <code>numLeaves</code> instead of summing them:</p>

<pre><code>numLeaves = 0
for t,w in self.children:  
    print('not leaf so sent through loop')
    numLeaves += len(t)
</code></pre>

<p>It can also be implemented differently:</p>

<pre><code>sum(len(t) for (t,w) in self.children)
</code></pre>
