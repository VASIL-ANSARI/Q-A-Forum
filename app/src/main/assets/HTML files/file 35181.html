<p>You can open a hyperlink in the default browser using:</p>

<pre><code>Process.Start(myHyperlink);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>

<p>Based on your comments, it seems you are having trouble accessing <code>result_1</code> (etc.).</p>

<p>You define <code>result_1</code> as a variable local to the method <code>search_google()</code></p>

<pre><code>public void search_google(string query) //Google Searching
{
    #region link strings
    string result_1 = "";
</code></pre>

<p>That means <code>result_1</code> is only visible within that method.</p>

<p>Your <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> statements do not appear to be part of <code>search_google()</code>, so they can never see <code>result_1</code>.  If those statements are in a different method, you can work around that issue by moving <code>result_1</code> to the class level (outside of <code>search_google()</code>).</p>

<p>ON a site note, rather than defining ten individual result strings, you probably want to use  an array of strings or a list of strings.</p>
