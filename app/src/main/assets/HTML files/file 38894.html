<p>Branching statements(return ,goto ) should no be used inside finally because execution of such statement nullifies other instructions which are executed before finally.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.20.2" rel="nofollow">Java Language Specification</a> says : If execution of the try block completes abruptly for any other reason R, then the finally block is executed, and then there is a choice:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the finally block completes normally, then the try statement completes  abruptly for reason R.</li>
<li>If the finally block completes abruptly for reason S, then the try statement  completes abruptly for reason S (and reason R is discarded).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - A return statement inside a finally block will cause any exception that might be thrown in the try or catch block to be discarded.</p>
