<p>In any case this helps any beginner iOS coder, I'll share the solution to my question. I'm not sure sure this is the most elegant solution or the one with the best performance but it seems to work for now... Basically inside the drawrect of my subclass of UIView I changed all of the components values (the values who define the color with RGB and alpha) to values that exist in a property. This property is a NSMutableArray which I use in my view controller to change its values and then call [self.subview setNeedsDisplay].</p>
