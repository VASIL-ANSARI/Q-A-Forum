<p>Depending on the authentication mechanism used, the charset used to encode the string may be wrong for the particular server you are authenticating against.</p>

<p>Some servers use a non UTF-8 charset for PLAIN and LOGIN SASL mechanisms (i.e. they are setup to use the region's locale charset). Unfortunately, there's no way for a client to know what charset that is.</p>

<p>Other SASL mechanisms like DIGEST-MD5 allow the client &amp; server to negotiate which charset is used (and usually ends up being UTF-8).</p>
