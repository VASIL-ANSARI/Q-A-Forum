<p>Even if you solve you compilation problems, embedding a sqlite database in the qrc file will not work. See e.g. the discussion in the <a href="http://www.qtcentre.org/archive/index.php/t-3174.html">Qt Centre Forum</a> or on the <a href="http://www.qtcentre.org/archive/index.php/t-3174.html">Qt-interest mailing list</a>. The best solution would be IMHO to include a dump of a database in the qrc file, create a memory sqlite db and rebuild the database from the SQL statements in the resource.</p>
