<p>Why not create an matrix (n, m) where each element is a possible cave. This way every cave will have 4 neighbors except the caves on the "borders".</p>

<p>Considering you are on the cave (i, j), your neighbors are (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1) and (i, j+1).</p>

<p>And for encapsulation, a CaveContainer object would be good to have. This way your implementation of the way caves are generated is not linked to the rest of the code.</p>
