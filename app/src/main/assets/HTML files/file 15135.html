<p>You could put the form inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the style attribute <code>display:none</code> then change that <code>display:block</code> when you need to show the form.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Now that the code has been formatted correctly I can expand on this further. You need to simply have a style on your option ul as display:none. This will mean the options are not visible by default.</p>

<p>If the user made an error AND they had picked an option, I imagine you would want to show the options by default? If so create a variable called $show_options which is false by default but true if any of the options had been picked on submit. Then in your html for the options box use this code:</p>

<p><code>&lt;ul id="options" style="&lt;?php echo (($show_options)?(''):('display:none')); ?&gt;"&gt;</code></p>
