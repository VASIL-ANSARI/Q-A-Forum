<p>I always choose uuid as a primary key. In comparison to int/long key, there is a slight overhead, but there are a lot of benefits: you cannot run into type overflow, you can shard database later on without changing primary keys, you can integrate with other systems and be sure that your primary keys are always unique, uuid cannot be guessed etc.</p>
