<p>That is quite a bit of files, but not to be unexpected if using a framework (Zend by any chance?).  The impact of including that many files is mainly dependent on your server's hard drives' speed.  Regardless, file access is extremely slow so if you can, reduce the number of includes.</p>

<p>APC does/can cache the opcodes for all those files in memory though, meaning no more disk seeks until the cache is invalidated/destroyed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try turning APC off and see how much of a difference it makes. There should be a noticeable spike in execution time.</p></li>
<li><p>Try profiling the script with xdebug.  You'll most likely find that there are other issues (code issues) that affect performance more than the file access.</p></li>
</ul>
