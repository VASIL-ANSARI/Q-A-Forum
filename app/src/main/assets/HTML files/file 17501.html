<p>If I'm reading this right, when you have "overall" selected you want to return all the age groups (so as not to limit by any age group)?</p>

<p>If so you need to remove the AgeGroup clause in your SQL statment.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?PHP

$sql = "SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE Gender = {$_REQUEST['gender']}";

if(isset($_REQUEST['age']))
{      
  $sql.= " AND AgeGroup = {$_REQUEST['age']}"
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will default to overall, so you may want to change the logic appropriately, hope I got what you were after, if not ignore it!</p>

<p>Also as a side note $_REQUEST isn't the best to use, if your using a form as your action collector set it to post and use $_POST instead, if you cant use $_GET to pull your data out of the url instead of request.</p>

<p>Edit: Added in brackets to make it easier to read.</p>
