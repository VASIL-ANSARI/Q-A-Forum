<p><code>MAXITR</code> is a named constant (aka <code>parameter</code>, in C "parameter" means what in Fortran is called "argument") in the subroutine. You have to go to the source code and change it there, if you need that.</p>

<pre><code>INTEGER maxitr
parameter( maxitr = 6 )
</code></pre>

<p>(lines 255--256)</p>

<p>Change the number 6 to whatever you need.</p>
