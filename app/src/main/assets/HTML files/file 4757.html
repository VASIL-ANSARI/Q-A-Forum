<p>Are you sure that bit of the code was included in the compilation on AIX 5.3?  I just went Google-whacking with 'site:ibm.com shl_descriptor' and there is precisely one item found:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21212239" rel="nofollow">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21212239</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is pointing to a problem on HP-UX with WAS (WebSphere Application Server).  There is sample code which uses <code>&lt;dl.h&gt;</code> (dynamic loader), and shows <code>shl_descriptor</code> and <code>shl_gethandle()</code> and <code>shl_load()</code>.</p>

<p>Given the complete absence of hits for anything in AIX and the presence of the HP-UX platform, then you have a slightly different problem to resolve.  The question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the conditional compilation on AIX 5.3 excluding the section that uses <code>shl_descriptor</code> and not excluding it on AIX 7.1.  You should look at the conditions wrapped around that code in the <code>#ifdef</code> line, and see what is used to trigger the HP-only compilation on AIX 5.3.</li>
</ul>
