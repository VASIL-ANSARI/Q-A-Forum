<p>To install app if we are using adb install command , it's not possible to restict app installation only to tablets or phones.
Also if we give  tag in  menifest it's only applicable for the Google Play store filter, to check this you can try following code, put it into your menifest and try to install it in 7 inch tablet, it will allow,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;supports-screens
        android:largeScreens="false"
        android:largestWidthLimitDp="600"
        android:normalScreens="true"
        android:smallScreens="true"
        android:xlargeScreens="false" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By using this code Google play store filters and restrict while installing only, but not in other cases as sharing apk, or installing in emulator.</p>

<p>So, to restrict the app installation to certain device when you upload APK at market , you need to do this
<strong>Applications->select your application->APK-> Supported devices | Excluded devices</strong></p>
