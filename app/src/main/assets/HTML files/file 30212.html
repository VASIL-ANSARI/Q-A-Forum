<p>I'm assuming that you're using GenerationType.AUTO to let Hibernate determine how to handle id generation. Here's a similar question to yours: 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15390856/who-is-responsible-of-the-auto-incrementation-of-a-primary-key-between-mysql-and">Who is responsible of the auto-incrementation of a primary key between MySQL and Hibernate?</a></p>

<p>So for MYSQL, hibernate defaults to MYSQL's AUTO_INCREMENT. Explanation of AUTO_INCREMENT can be found here: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/example-auto-increment.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/example-auto-increment.html</a></p>

<p>As for how Hibernate / MYSQL knows the last generated id, MYSQL has an AUTO_INCREMENT column for each table which the AUTO_INCREMENT id generation strategy is specified, in which the most recently generated Id is stored.</p>
