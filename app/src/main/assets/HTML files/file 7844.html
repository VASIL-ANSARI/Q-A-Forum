<p>From your other posts, I'm going on the assumption that your database on this too is MySQL.  You mention a unique column which typically means an auto-increment column.  If you "delete" the entries after you've built them (say starting 1-10), and then try to re-add your next cycle the same 1-10 items, it can choke on you giving you this message.  If you add numbers to your table starting with the last one used... see if that helps.</p>
