<p>OK. Solved it from suggestion from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1221336/jasti">User that helped</a></p>

<p>I was missing the binding mode. (Text="{Binding Path=Name, Mode=TwoWay}")</p>

<p>the second issue is because the control did not save the data into the object because it still had focus. The saving was not commited into the object</p>
