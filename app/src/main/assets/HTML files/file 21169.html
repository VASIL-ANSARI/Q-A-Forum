<p>Exception message tells you everything. You need to add FK relation to Image model:</p>

<pre><code>manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(Manufacturer)
</code></pre>

<p>If you need only one image for one manufacturer consider putting it in Manufacturer model. This would be more efficient (less DB queries or "select_related" functions) and easier to manage.</p>

<p>As for Many to many relation between Product and Image - just use ManyToManyField (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/</a>) in Product model and leave Image model as is.</p>
