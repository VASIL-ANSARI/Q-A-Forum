<p>An easy way to accomplish this is to use a sub-query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  Year(FROM_UNIXTIME(tTime1)) as YEAR, 
  Month(FROM_UNIXTIME(tTime1)) as MONTH, 
  Count(*) As BUY_RESULT, 
  (
    SELECT 
      COUNT(sub.*) 
    FROM 
      zupsbackup AS sub 
    WHERE 
      sub.Result = 'SELL' and 
      sub.tPeriod = '60' AND 
      Year(FROM_UNIXTIME(sub.tTime1)) = YEAR AND 
      Month(FROM_UNIXTIME(tTime1)) = MONTH
  ) AS SELL_RESULT
FROM 
  zupsbackup 
WHERE 
  Result='BUY' AND 
  tPeriod='60' 
GROUP BY 
  Year(FROM_UNIXTIME(tTime1)), 
  Month(FROM_UNIXTIME(tTime1))
</code></pre>
