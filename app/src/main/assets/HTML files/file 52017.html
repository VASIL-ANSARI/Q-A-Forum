<p>While Maljam is correct about it being an infinite loop, by making the assumption that both start at 1 and are &lt;= n:</p>

<p>The <strong>outer for-loop</strong> will make the inner for-loop occur: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>n-1 times</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>inner for-loop</strong> will make the Sysout statement run approximately (by flooring the function):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>log_2(n) times</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the result of the big-O is the product of those two: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O((n-1)(log_2(n))) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or more simply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O(nlogn)</p>
</blockquote>
