<p>onListItemClick was firing after all.  Problem is that the listview remains visible.  I can get it to disappear with the following in onListItemClick():</p>

<pre><code>l.setVisibility(android.view.View.GONE);
</code></pre>

<p>However, I am not sure how to to make it reappear in onViewStateRestored().  For now, I'll set a solid background for the fragment.  Ideally, though, I want to toggle the visibility on the ListView so I can inherit the View background.</p>
