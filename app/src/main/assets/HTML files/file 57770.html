<p>After thinking over a couple ways to try this, I think your best bet is whenever you create a rides request for a specific user, but before you send the surge confirmation url to the client, you need to store the surge confirmation url as a key with the value being the user's ID. That way whenever you get the surge confirmation id from the redirect, you can just look it up in your dictionary to see who the user associated with it is. </p>

<p>Let me know if this isn't entirely feasible and I'll keep contemplating some other ways to try this.</p>
