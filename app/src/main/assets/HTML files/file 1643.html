<p>You are relying on the browser filling the in correct form fields automatically when re-entering a form using the back button. AFAIK, only FF and Safari do this by default. Whether it can be activated in IE and other browsers, I don't know. Anyway, you can't rely on it in the wild.</p>

<p>You may have to work around this using Cookies. You would have to set cookie values <code>onchange</code> or <code>onunload</code>, and read out the cookie values when your page loads.</p>
