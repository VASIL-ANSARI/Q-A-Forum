<p>The purpose of those methods is to notify your controller when the view it controls has finished loading, and finished unloading, in case there are things that the controller needs to accomplish in those "interesting moments".</p>

But that's exactly what would happen if that code was omitted entirely: the message would be delivered to the lowest class in the inheritance chain that defined an implementation for the method.</p>
