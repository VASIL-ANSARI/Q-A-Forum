<p><code>paint()</code> method is automatically called when a Component is rendered.</p>

<p>Your oval is not getting displayed because it's hiding behind the tool bar of the Frame or Title bar. (The top one what ever you call it).</p>

<p>Change your fillOval to <code>g.fillOval(50, 50, 20, 20);</code> and you will see it.</p>

<p>Also, you should always call <code>super.paint(g)</code> if your overriding it.</p>

<p>Also, don't call <code>repaint()</code> from your <code>paint()</code> method.</p>
