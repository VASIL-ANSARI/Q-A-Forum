<p>The example looks pretty confused there is a lot of code there that looks to be a distraction.</p>

<p>From what I can see the problem is in this code:</p>

<pre><code>a11y = function(f) {
    a11y.change(f);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Here you are defining a new function called a11y and inside the definition of that function you are calling a method 'change' on the function a11y being defined. I'm surprised that works in any browser.</p>
