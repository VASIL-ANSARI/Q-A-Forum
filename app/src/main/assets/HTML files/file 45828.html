<p>You could split your text into chunks (e.g. words are mabye letters) and distribute the creation of word meshes across frames. Something like</p>

<pre><code>function TextBuilder( text, opts, parent ) {
    this.words = text.split( /\s/g );
    this.index = 0;
    this.step = function () {
        if ( this.index &gt;= this.words.length ) return;

        var word = this.words[ this.index ];
        ++this.index;
        var geo = new THREE.TextGeometry( word, opts );
        var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geo, opts.material );
        // need to position mesh according to word length here
        parent.add( mesh );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>then create a textbuilder and call <code>textbuilder.step()</code> in animate. The positioning might be an issue though, unless your font is monospace. Otherwise you'll probably have to dig further into <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/extras/FontUtils.js" rel="nofollow">FontUtils</a> to see how spacing is done there, and somehow apply that to the textbuilder.</p>
