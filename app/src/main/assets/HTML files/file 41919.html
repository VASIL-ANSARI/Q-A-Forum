<p>That's probably because by the time you are trying to skip it, it's already read the node. According to the <a href="http://xml4r.github.io/libxml-ruby/rdoc/classes/LibXML/XML/Reader.html#method-i-read" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for the <code>#read</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>reader.read -&gt; nil|true|false
Causes the reader to move to the next node in the stream, exposing its properties.

Returns true if a node was successfully read or false if there are no more nodes to read. On errors, an exception is raised.
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to skip the node prior to calling the <code>#read</code> method on it. I'm sure there are many ways you could do that but it doesn't look like this library supports XPath expressions, or I would suggest something like that.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The question was clarified so that the SAX parser is a required part of the solution. I have removed links that would not be helpful given this constraint.</p>
