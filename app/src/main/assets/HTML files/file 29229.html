<p>pow is usually evaluated by this formula:</p>

<pre><code>x^y = exp2(y*log2(x))
</code></pre>

<p>Functions <code>exp2(x),log2(x)</code> are directly implemented in <strong>FPU</strong>. If you want to implement <strong>bignums</strong> then they can also be evaluated by basic operators with use of precomputed table of sqrt-powers like:</p>

<pre><code>2^1/2, 2^1/4, 2^1/8, 2^1/16, 2^1/32 ...
</code></pre>

<p>to speed up the process</p>
