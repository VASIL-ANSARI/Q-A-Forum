<p><code>Out of memory on a 42701840-byte allocation.</code> 
This looks like a Out of Memory issue when you try loading the <code>android:src="@drawable/getdressedimg"</code> for your imageview. How big is the Image? If its too big, you need to scale down to match the ImageView height and width.  Check <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on how to do that. </p>
