<p>A static variable is class-level and thus shared among all instances of the same class and thus behaves like as a global application-wide variable. Every single visitor of your webapp would share the very same variable. Every single uploaded file of every single visitor would end up in the same list which is in turn visible to every single visitor.</p>

<p>Is this what you really want? </p>

<p>I don't think so. Just don't make it a static variable at all. Remove the <code>static</code> modifier and you should be all set with a view scoped bean. A view scoped bean lives as long as you're interacting with the same view by ajax.</p>
