<p>Every time you click on the button you create a new JInternalFrame object, but you only ever add the first internal frame that you create to the desktop pane.</p>

<p>Don't keep creating new internal frame objects. I would guess you should only create the internal frame if your "frame1" variable is null. </p>

<p>If you need more help then post a proper <a href="http://www.sscce.org/" rel="nofollow">SSCCE</a> that demonstrates the problem. </p>
