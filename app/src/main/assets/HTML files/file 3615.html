<p>It's good to know that whatever you're allocating is initialized to zero.  Many bugs have come about from code that uses uninitialized memory.  Plus, some default values in structs / classes might be fine as zero so you don't need to change all values after the malloc.
<p>
For instance, allocate a struct that has some pointers in it w/ malloc.  NULL checks aren't always going to work unless they are set to NULL.  If you calloc, you don't have to do the extra initialization steps for pointer values.</p>
