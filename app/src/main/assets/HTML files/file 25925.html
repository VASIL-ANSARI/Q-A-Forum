<p>On the Mac you might have created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store" rel="nofollow">".DS_Store"</a> file when placing the file in the folder. Files starting with a "." are hidden on a Mac, and therefore you can't see it in the Finder. </p>

<p>Depending on what you want to achieve, you might either want to ignore all ".DS_Store" files or all files starting with a ".".</p>

<p>Here is how you ignore these files:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>    updateDirectory.list(new FilenameFilter() {
        @Override
        public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
            return name.startsWith(".");
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>To find out, you can print out the array you get from  the <code>list()</code> method.</p>

<p>Please note, that on Windows, files starting with "." are <em>not</em> hidden, so you might confuse your users. I recommend to implement the filter with care - maybe even with a operating system specific variant.</p>
