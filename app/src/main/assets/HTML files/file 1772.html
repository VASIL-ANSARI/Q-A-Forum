<p>In this instance, the PHP runs on the webserver and sends some output to the browser.</p>

<p>The browser then processes that output as JavaScript.</p>

<p>There is no way to directly access the PHP. You have to send an HTTP request back to the server.</p>

<p>This could be a simple link (but don't do that for a delete file operation, GET operations should be safe (or else a bot will walk over your site and delete everything), a form, or if you really want to involve JavaScript - <a href="http://www.jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html" rel="nofollow">XHR</a> (or some other object that can be used to perform Ajax). Libraries such as <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" rel="nofollow">YUI</a> or <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> can help you with the heavy lifting here.</p>

<p>Either way (form or Ajax), you'll probably end up putting the data about what file you want to delete in the POST data. Your PHP script will read this (from <code>$_POST</code> and call the function you want).</p>

<p>â¦ and if you do go down the Ajax route, don't forget to <a href="http://icant.co.uk/articles/pragmatic-progressive-enhancement/#build" rel="nofollow">build on things that work</a>.</p>
