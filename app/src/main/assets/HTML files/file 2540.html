  <p>Is the fastcall calling convention really faster than other calling conventions, such as cdecl?</p>

<p>I believe that Microsofts implementation of <code>fastcall</code> on x86 and x64 involves passing the first two parameters in registers instead of on the stack.</p>

<p>Since it typically saves at least four memory accesses, yes it is generally faster. However, if the function involved is register-starved and is thus likely to write them to locals on the stack anyway, there's not likely to be a significant increase.</p>
