<p>I would say it's probably a bad idea to parse HTML on the device if you're experiencing performance issues. Have you considered creating a web app that your device app fetches data from?</p>

<p>If the data is from one source (i.e.; one webpage and not many) I would build a web app to prefetch the site, parse for relevant data, and cache it for later use on the device(s).</p>
