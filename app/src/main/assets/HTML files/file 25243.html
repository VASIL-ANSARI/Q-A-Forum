<p>I just clicked the link you provided and the PayPal MECL for the Android was downloaded. Are you still having issues with it? </p>

<p>Code samples from X.com are going to all be deleted soon. They're moving to Developer.PayPal.com and github - <a href="http://paypal.github.io/" rel="nofollow">http://paypal.github.io/</a></p>

<p>I don't believe the MECL stuff is going to be added - sorry. </p>
