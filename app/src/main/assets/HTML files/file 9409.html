<p>Some assumptions:</p>

<p>When you say "It makes a reflection of a class" I'm guessing that means you're using reflection to create a new object.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the methods you're calling are instance methods (not static).</p>

<p>So if those guesses are right, making the method you call through reflection synchronized didn't prevent the calls from overlapping because you were calling the method on a different object each time. If you add the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to a method definition, it uses the object the method is called on as its lock.</p>
