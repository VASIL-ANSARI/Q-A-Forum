<p>While looking into <a href="https://github.com/slimphp/PHP-View/blob/master/src/PhpRenderer.php" rel="nofollow">the Code</a> of the PhpRenderer you will see currently there is no way to specify <code>data</code> outside of the <code>render()</code> function.</p>

<p>You could create an issue and/or make a pull request to support that functionality.</p>
