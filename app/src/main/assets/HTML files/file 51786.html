<p>A possible, basilar approach could be something like the following one (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>var elapsed = current - previous;
if(elapsed &gt; clampOverElapsed) {
    elapsed = clampOverElapsed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>clampOverElapsed</code> is set somewhere to a reasonable value, as an example 25 ms.<br/>
This way, by having that control within the loop, you should nicely handle pauses as well as unseasonably longer iterations, without caring about what's the source of your big <code>elapsed</code> value, so that you have not to explicit</p>
