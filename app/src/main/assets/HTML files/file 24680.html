<p>There is no need for Domain Model since it will be redundancy. EF classes directly can act as Domain Model and they are converted to View Models while sending it to View. EF can be separated into different class library. Most of them use repository pattern along with any ORM incase it would be easy if they go for replacement. But I've seen criticism over using repository pattern, check <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/4784/architecting-in-the-pit-of-doom-the-evils-of-the-repository-abstraction-layer" rel="nofollow">this</a> out.</p>
