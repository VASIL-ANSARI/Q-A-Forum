<p>I found out that I had to copy classes/Group.php to override/classes/Group.php and modify it: </p>

<pre><code>class Group extends GroupCore
{
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to be the model for this.</p>

<p>and to add fiel(d) to the model I wanted to update, and it seems it will fetch that also when I try to edit the group.</p>

<p>Also, I still don't know why overriding AdminGroupController DOES NOT work, but overriding this class (model) works...</p>
