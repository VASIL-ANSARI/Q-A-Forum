<p>The <code>Fragment</code> will be retained (and thus won't be garbage collected). The <code>Fragment</code> will hold a reference to the adapter, and the adapter holds a reference to the activity <code>Context</code>, so yes, I believe this will cause a memory leak.</p>

<p>A very simple solution would be to pass <code>getActivity().getApplicationContext()</code> to the adapter constructor instead.</p>
