<p>Conversely, why do you think there <em>should</em> be a runtime error? There's no rule to mandate that.</p>

<p>It's <em>undefined</em> to divide by zero. In this case it seems like, because it could be caught at compile-time, your compiler simply ignored the operation &hellip; most likely because you never used its "result".</p>

<p>So, this program runs and possibly outputs nothing:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    int x = 0;
    1/x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas I could expect <em>this</em> program to result in a system-level arithmetic exception:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 1/x;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</code></pre>

<p>In general, when you have undefined behaviour, don't expect anything. Don't expect your program to "work", don't expect it to produce meaningful output, don't expect it not to phone your ex-wife and rescind legal custody of your pet chickens, and don't expect it to cause the error you wanted.</p>
