<p>You could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/warnings.html#testing-warnings" rel="nofollow">the <code>warnings</code> module</a>.</p>

<p>However, in this case I think it would be easier to check the return value of <code>connect_signals</code>. From <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/pygtk/2.22/class-gtkbuilder.html#method-gtkbuilder--connect-signals" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, if there is at least one such missing handler, <code>connect_signals</code> will return a list of their names, else return value is None.</p>
