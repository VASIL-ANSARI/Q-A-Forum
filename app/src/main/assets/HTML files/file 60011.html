<p>Based on the "If ...def" statement in that header file, the </p>

<p>"if" block : "if you use the particular header file in C++" </p>

<p>"else" block : "if you use the particular header file not in C++, could be C"</p>

<p>if you do not wrap the headers in "extern C" in the "if" block(which is meant for C++), the "C" linkage wont be maintained for the function names.</p>

<p>"C" do not have function over loading concept, but where as C++. So C++ compiler does some function name mangling for "extern C" functions.</p>

<p>Here is a very nice article.
In C++ source, what is the effect of extern âCâ? - in stack over flow.</p>

<p>For regular standard C libraries, the extern wrapper not required. Mostly it is taken care by standard C.</p>

<p>ex: something like below (yvals.h on windows).</p>

<pre><code>  #define _C_LIB_DECL       extern "C" {    /* C has extern "C" linkage */
  #define _END_C_LIB_DECL   }
  #define _EXTERN_C         extern "C" {
  #define _END_EXTERN_C     }
</code></pre>
