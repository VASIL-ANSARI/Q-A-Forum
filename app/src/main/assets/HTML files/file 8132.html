<p>Yes, just call the normal paint method on the object and pass the Graphics you want it to paint on.  However, this is just going to paint it and it sounds like you want it to possibly scroll which means you will need to add it to your custom JPanel. In that case just add the panel and you a layout manager that will place the component where you need it.</p>
