<p>Using a subquery, you can first count the number in each category. From that, the outer query selects the maximum count along with the corresponding <code>categoryID</code> and <code>interest_desc</code>.</p>

<p>This query should result in the most popular <code>interest_desc</code> for each <code>categoryID</code>, plus how many occurrences it had. Of course, it's untested.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT interest_desc, categoryID, MAX(num_in_cat) AS num_in_cat FROM
(
SELECT 
  interest_desc,
  categoryID,
  COUNT(categoryID) AS num_in_cat
FROM tbl
GROUP BY interest_desc, categoryID
) subsel 
GROUP BY interest_desc, categoryID
</code></pre>

<p>In PHP, following a successful query and looping call to <code>mysql_fetch_assoc()</code> into an array <code>$results</code>:</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>You need to fetch your results in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>// Load $arrayResults in a loop...
$arrayResults = array();
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($mostPopularInterest)) {
  $arrayResults[] = $row;
}

foreach ($arrayResults as $result) {
  echo "{$result['interest_desc']} was the most popular in category   {$result['categoryID']} with {$result['num_in_cat']} occurrences\n";
}
</code></pre>
