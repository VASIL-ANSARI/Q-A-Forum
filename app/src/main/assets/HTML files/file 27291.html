  <p>There's no explicit limit on string length, but Parse Objects are
  limited to 128k. Otherwise, you should use a Parse File.</p>

<p>If you are planning to have many articles and there will be a lot of data to download you probably want to store the full text separate from the PFObject that represents the article. For example, you may have a PFObject with title, date, etc, but store the full text in another PFObject or PFFile. You can then fetch the object containing the full text when a user selects an item in your tableview.</p>
