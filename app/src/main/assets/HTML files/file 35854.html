<p>There is a bug in Facebook and its APIs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is currently a bug which will prevent Facebook Login for Windows
  Phone from working if you have any entries in the "Valid OAuth
  redirect URIs" field in the Advanced section of your app settings.
  This can be worked around by adding
  "<a href="https://m.facebook.com/dialog/return/ms">https://m.facebook.com/dialog/return/ms</a>" in this field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That suggestion is wrong, and you actually need to add <code>https://www.facebook.com/</code> to the "Valid OAuth redirect URIs" field in the Advanced section of your app settings. </p>
