<p>If you know the calls are single threaded or thread safe, a simple boolean would be enough, though your could drop it.</p>

<pre><code>private EventHandler&lt;T&gt; delegate;

public void handle(T event) {
    if (delegate != null)
        delegate.handle(event);
    delegate = null; // don't retain a delegate we don't need
}
</code></pre>
