<p>In no particular order, here's my ideas</p>

<p>Create a sort function that allows you to sort by any criteria</p>

<p>A linear layout with the header, then a listview containing a linear layout with your actual data</p>

<p>The header would be a horizontally-partitioned linear layout with appropriate weight values</p>

<p>Create a separate layout file for the rows, have it have the same weight values as above</p>

<p>In the onclicklistener for each of the headers, have it call the sort function and then re-make the list.</p>

<p>Granted this is based off of some not-very-similar stuff that I did, so I don't really have any code to help out with it.</p>
