<p>In your second example, you haven't <em>simplified</em> the constructor at all. You've added an <em>extra</em> dependency. This isn't a good idea. You want your component depending on the interfaces it depends on, not on <code>IKernel</code>.</p>

<p>If your class has 8-10 dependencies, that might be a <a href="http://www.oodesign.com/single-responsibility-principle.html" rel="nofollow">sign that the class is trying to do too much</a>.</p>
