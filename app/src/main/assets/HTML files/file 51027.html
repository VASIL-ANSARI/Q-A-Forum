<p>There are several methods to do the same. I'm describing how you should do it in the standard way. Upload the particles.js to your active theme folder ( I uploaded it to 'js' folder inside theme director. Open up functions.php in your active theme and insert following code.</p>

<pre><code>function load_my_scripts(){
    wp_enqueue_script('muaw-ajax', get_template_directory_uri().'/js/particles.js');    
}

add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_my_scripts');
</code></pre>

<p>Save the changes you made to functions.php, then it should be included to your theme.</p>
