<ul>
<li>In the first version you promise you're not going to write to the
object that <code>num</code> points to</li>
<li>In the second version you promise that and you also prevent yourself
(i.e. IsThisNumber..) from making <code>num</code> point to something else.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, in the second version <strong>the pointer itself is also <code>const</code></strong>, in addition to the pointee.</p>
