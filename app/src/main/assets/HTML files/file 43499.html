<p>First, what I would do is also iterate each <code>td</code>'s thru foreach. So that you'll be able to get which index number key it falls into. (Note that of course its indexing is zero based so it actually starts at <code>0</code>).</p>

<p>Then inside the inner loop, just check if the class is <code>null</code>, then map it in the corresponding word <code>1 = one, 2 = two, etc..</code>.</p>

<p>Rough example:</p>

<pre><code>$map = array(1 =&gt; 'one', 2 =&gt; 'two', 3 =&gt; 'three');
foreach ($demo-&gt;find('tr') as $tr) { // loop each table row
    // then loop each td
    foreach($tr-&gt;find('td') as $i =&gt; $td) { // indexing starts at zero
        if($td-&gt;class == 'null') { // if its class is null
            echo $map[$i+1]; // map it to its corresponding word equivalent
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So in this case, this would output <code>three</code> and then <code>two</code>. Inside the second table row, the <code>null</code> lands on the third, inside the third row it lands into the second.</p>
