<p>A typical way to do this in Oracle:</p>

<pre><code>select department_id
from (select count(employee_id), department_id
      from employees
      group by department_id
      order by count(employee_id) desc
     ) t
where rownum = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have potential duplicates and want all the department ids, then a join to the max or analytic function is a better approach.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>select department_id
from (select count(employee_id), department_id,
             rank() over (order by count(employee_id) desc) as seqnum
      from employees
      group by department_id
     ) t
where seqnum = 1;
</code></pre>
