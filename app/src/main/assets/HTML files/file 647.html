<p>I often like to add a "SortOrder" column to results that I want to sort in a way other than is provided by the data.  I usually use an integer and just add it when I am getting the data.</p>

<p>I don't show this column and only use it for the purposes of establishing the order.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, but it is quick and easy and gives you a great deal of control.</p>
