<p>From the <em>Class NatTable</em>  i could find that <strong>SWT.DOUBLE_BUFFERED</strong> being used as one of the default style options.</p>

<p>On adding <strong>SWT.DOUBLE_BUFFERED</strong> as a style option in my constructor,</p>

<pre><code>NatTable natTable = new NatTable(parentComposite, SWT.DOUBLE_BUFFERED); 
</code></pre>

<p>i could find that the flickering is reduced.</p>
