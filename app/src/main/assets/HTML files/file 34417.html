<p>You don't want to call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.run" rel="nofollow"><code>run</code></a> method on a thread directly. Call <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.start" rel="nofollow"><code>start</code></a> instead, which will kick off the child thread, which will in turn run the <code>run</code> method.</p>

<p>Your current code is essentially single threaded, since the <code>run</code> call does the work of the child thread in the parent instead. The child thread is never actually started! (You're also calling your <code>main.call</code> method twice, which I'd expect to block or raise an exception, but that's a separate issue.)</p>
