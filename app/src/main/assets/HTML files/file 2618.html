<p>No, both of the returned dates from those methods are autoreleased. You don't need to worry about their memory management, though to be a good citizen, setting the pointer to nil when you're done with them would be a good idea.</p>

<p>As a general rule, you can follow what I call the "CARN" rule. in Cocoa/Cocoa Touch any method that has the words <em>Copy, Alloc, Retain,</em> or <em>New</em> in them will return objects that need to be released by you at some point. These are naming conventions applied to methods that return objects with a retain count of +1. The class that calls these methods "owns" the object and is responsible for releasing it when it's finished with it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
