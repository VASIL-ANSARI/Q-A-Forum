<p>You'll need Ajax to do that.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/django-and-ajax-form-submissions/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial to help you.</p>

<p>you need to download a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realpython/django-form-fun/master/part1/main.js" rel="nofollow">script</a> (it is in the tutorial) to help you with the <em>csrf_token</em>, otherwise, when you submit the form you'll get a django error related with this token.</p>

<p>when calling to the Ajax url like this </p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
        url: "some path/", // endpoint
</code></pre>

<p>you'll hvae to create that url in your <em>urls.py</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^path/$', views.your_view_name),
]
</code></pre>

<p>this way you can call the view (or just a function in this case) send the info you need to your template.</p>

<p>Later, with jquery you can change the html of the element with its id something like this</p>

<pre><code>$('#your_element_id').html("&lt;p&gt;your updated code goes here&lt;/p&gt;");
</code></pre>

<p>you can also append elementets, just change the <em>.html</em> with <em>.append</em>.
The difference is that .html replace what you have with the code you give, and .apend only adds that code with what you have there.</p>
