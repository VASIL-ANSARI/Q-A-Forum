<p>I got the app working again and I believe the issue was a jar that the project uses, which was built using a (now outdated) version of Bar.  Suppose that my app depends on jars X (which includes Bar) and Y (which uses Bar.)  I knew that the signature of Bar had changed recently and I could see that the change was making its way into the APK.  But what I didn't realize was that jar Y uses Bar and had not been rebuilt lately.  Since the exception being thrown only mentioned the method name - <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> (the constructor) - and not the parameters, I didn't realize Bar was trying to be constructed using the (now non-existent) default constructor.</p>
