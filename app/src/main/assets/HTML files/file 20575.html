<p>For answer to your question, please have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29" rel="nofollow">RSA algorithm</a> for the actual formulae . For the complexity part, its better to leave the transformation to the JS</p>

<p>In case it helps, I used <a href="http://ashwinrayaprolu.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/javascript-rsa-encryption-and-java-decryption/" rel="nofollow">this code</a> for my application and it worked wonders :)</p>
