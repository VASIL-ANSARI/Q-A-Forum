<p>You must turn hardware acceleration off for <code>clipPath()</code> to work. More specifically, call</p>

<p><code>this.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null)</code> (as specified by the page mentioned <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Basically you want to leave hardware acceleration on for the rest of your application but turn it off specifically in this situation where <code>clipPath()</code> is not supported with it on.</p>

<p>Also look at the table on the page.</p>
