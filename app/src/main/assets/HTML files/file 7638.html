<p>adb in your /platform-tools directory doesn't have an x bit set (chmod +x adb to fix) or is otherwise not executable, in which case running something like 'bash adb ' should get you going.</p>

<p>This is assuming you're in your platform-tools directory.  If not, switch to platform-tools and try again.</p>
