<p>Nothing wrong with it, definitely you cannot using the same coordinates when you change your orientation. In you code, you should deal with them separately, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if(orientationIsLandScape()){
     background-&gt;setPosition();
else{
     background-&gt;setPosition();
}
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>orientationIsLandScape()</code>should be some function written by yourself to detect the current orientation</p>
