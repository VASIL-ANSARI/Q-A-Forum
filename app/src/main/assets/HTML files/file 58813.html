<p>The behaviour of your program is <em>undefined</em>. You cannot use <code>%d</code> as the format specifier for an array type or the address of an array type. You could have passed <code>arr[0]</code> to get the value of the first element in that array.</p>

<p>Occasionally <code>arr</code> does <em>decay</em> to a pointer of type <code>int*</code>, such as when it is passed to a function. The fact that <code>arr</code> is equal to <code>&amp;arr</code> in the context of their being a parameter to <code>printf</code> with the format specifier corrected to <code>%p</code> is also due to pointer decay.</p>
