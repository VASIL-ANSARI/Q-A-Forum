<p>Not sure what you are asking?</p>

<p>Spring comes with a <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/CustomEditorConfigurer.html" rel="nofollow">CustomEditorConfigurer</a> to supply custom String &lt;-> Object converters.</p>

<p>To use this, just add the CustomEditorConfigurer as bean to your config, and add the custom converters. However, these converters are typically used when converting string attributes in the config file into real objects.</p>

<p>If you are using Spring MVC, then take a look at the section on <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/reference/mvc.html#mvc-annotation" rel="nofollow">annotated MVC</a></p>

<p>Specifically, have a look at the <strong>@RequestParam</strong> and the <strong>@ModelAttribute</strong> annotations?</p>

<p>Hope this helps? </p>
