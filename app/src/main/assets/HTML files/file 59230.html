<p>taking an example of a 32 bit computer reading a 4 byte word of data: </p>

<p>In the hardware, a 32 bit computer reads 4 bytes at a time but only on every 4th byte. This is because the memory bus is 4 bytes wide.</p>

<p>If your 4 byte data does not start on one of those 4 byte boundaries, the computer must read the memory twice, and then assemble the 4 bytes to a single register internally.</p>

<p>Based on the architecture chosen, the compiler knows this and places/pads data structures so that two byte data occur on two byte boundaries, 4 byte data starts on 4 byte boundaries, etc.  This is specifically to avoid mis-aligned reads.</p>

<p>You can get misaligned reads if you read data in as bytes (like from a serial protocol) and then access them as 32 bit words. Avoid this in speed critical code.  Usually it is taken care of for you and is not a problem.</p>
