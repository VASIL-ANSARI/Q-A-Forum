<p>Since <code>getTitle</code> returns a string by value, when you call it twice, you get two different strings. You need to make sure you are calling <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> on the same string though. So you can store the result in another string variable.</p>

<pre><code>std::string str = getTitle(i);
std::copy(str.begin(), str.end(), otitle + sizeof(int) + i*80);
</code></pre>

<p>If your original version with memcpy handles copying over a null-terminator (can't tell from your snippet), you'll need to handle that manually. There are other details that might be wrong here, because I don't know the exact details of what your code is supposed to be doing, but this at least gives a correct usage of <code>std::copy</code>.</p>
