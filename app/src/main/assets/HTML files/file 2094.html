<p>You can't create a vector of an abstract class type because you cannot create instances of an abstract class, and C++ Standard Library containers like std::vector store values (i.e. instances). If you want to do this, you will have to create a vector of pointers to the abstract class type.</p>

<p>Your workround would not work because virtual functions (which is  why you want the abstract class in the first place) only work when called through pointers or references. You cannot create vectors of references either, so this is a second reason why you must use a vector of pointers.</p>

<p>You should realise that C++ and C# have very little in common. If you are intending to learn C++, you should think of it as starting from scratch, and read a good dedicated C++ tutorial such as <a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/">Accelerated C++</a> by Koenig and Moo.</p>
