<p>The value entered in the markup for the <code>IsSpecial</code> property won't have been assigned to the property until after the constructor is run. Think about it,.. you're expecting code equivalent to the following:</p>

<pre><code>WebControlExample webControlExample = null;
webControlExample.IsSpecial = true;
webControlExample = new WebControlExample();
</code></pre>

<p>What's actually happening (simplified!) is:</p>

<pre><code>WebControlExample webControlExample = null;
webControlExample = new WebControlExample();
webControlExample.IsSpecial = true;
</code></pre>

<p>There is no way to affect this for the constructor, and you probably shouldn't be doing much of anything in the constructor for a WebControl anyway.</p>
