<p>The correct way of doing this is using a RecyclerView. To the RecyclerView you set a layout manager and then treat it as any other RecyclerView/Listview (set adapter). Basically like this: </p>

<pre><code>mStaggeredLayoutManager = new StaggeredGridLayoutManager(2, StaggeredGridLayoutManager.VERTICAL);
mRecycler.setLayoutManager(mStaggeredLayoutManager);
</code></pre>

<p>The contents in each row will have to be different heights to give the staggered look, otherwise it will look just like a GridView.</p>
