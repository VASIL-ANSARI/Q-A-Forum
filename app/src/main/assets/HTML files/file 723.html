<p>If it's not worth testing, it's not worth writing.</p>

<p>That doesn't always mean you should write tests.  Sometimes it means you should delete code.  Do you need these beans?  Do they actually do anything important?  If you need them, you should write tests.  If not, delete the code and live a happier life knowing you have less to maintain.</p>
