<p>Figured it out and thought I'd share for anyone else running into this.  It created a config file within the current path under <code>.bundle/config</code>, which contained a line reading: <code>BUNDLE_PATH: foobar</code>.</p>

<p>To fix it, I just did:</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf .bundle
</code></pre>
