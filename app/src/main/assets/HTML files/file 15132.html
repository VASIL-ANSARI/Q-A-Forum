<p>What you would do for that is a listview whose itemÂ´s provide different layoutÂ´s. </p>

<p>For example extra layouts for messageÂ´s that: </p>

<ol>
<li>are written by you, </li>
<li>written by the other,</li>
<li>entryÂ´s with information about the conversation</li>
</ol>

<p>ItÂ´s really not to hard to build if you know how to handle listview and listadapter. </p>

<p>Good practice also! </p>
