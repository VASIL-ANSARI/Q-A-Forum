<p>The method dispatch technique that you want (<code>&lt;req method='methodName'&gt;</code>) is a non-standard technique, so there is no built-in support for it. You have a couple of options:</p>

<p>1) Just do the dispatch yourself. E.g. if using WCF, have a single OperationContract method that looks at the attribute and then calls one of the 6 methods you need.</p>

<p>2) Create a custom dispatcher.
For WCF, take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734665%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734665%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a> . For ASP.NET Web API, you can probably start here - <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/advanced/http-message-handlers" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/advanced/http-message-handlers</a> - but I have less experience with it so can't tell you for sure.</p>

<p>Approach #1 is certainly much easier, but if you're going to create a lot of such APIs, #2 may be the way to go. Or just switch to something more standard - either SOAP, or a "true" RESTful API where all the routing/dispatch information is in the URL itself and not in the message body.</p>
