<p>Please try to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all" rel="nofollow"><strong>Promise.all()</strong></a> inside saving function. As discussed in the documentation, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Promise.all(iterable) method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This same method was used in this SO post - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35381423/how-to-save-multiple-mongodb-collections-using-promise?rq=1">How to save multiple mongodb collections using Promise</a>. Sample code on how to implement <code>promise.all()</code> can found in the given SO post and in the documentation. I hope that addresses your concern.</p>
