<p>You could also just add a handler to your Store that gets called when a certain event is emited in your store</p>

<p>So lets say in your store you have a method:</p>

<pre><code>Store = { ...

   addUnreadDoneListener:function(callback){
      this.on(SOME_EVENT_CONSTANT, callback);
   },

...}
</code></pre>

<p>In your componentWillMount you can register to this "addUnreadDoneListener" with a function of your component, which then gets called everytime your store emits this certain event.</p>

<p>I personally do this aswell in my project. And I think its pretty easy to manage this way</p>

<p>Hope this helped.</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to mension... I use Eventemitter to do this.</p>
