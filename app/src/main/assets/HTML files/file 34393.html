<p>The comments in the code described it quite clearly:</p>

<pre><code># we're going to name the file by the date it was downloaded (e.g. 2012-3-18.csv)
fname = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")+".csv";
</code></pre>

<p>So just change the line to</p>

<pre><code>fname = "finviz.csv";
</code></pre>

<p>And fix the file existence check logic:</p>

<pre><code># check if the file does not already exist
if not os.path.isfile(savepath+"/"+fname):
    # open a file to save the data to ("wb" means write binary mode)
    outfile = open(savepath+"/"+fname, "wb");
    # download the data from the url specified above
    infile = urllib2.urlopen(url);
    # read the downloaded data and write it to our output file
    outfile.write(infile.read());
    # close the output file once we're done
    outfile.close();
else:
    print "'"+fname+"' ALREADY EXISTS in the save directory '"+savepath+"'.";
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code># open a file to save the data to ("wb" means write binary mode)
outfile = open(savepath+"/"+fname, "wb");
# download the data from the url specified above
infile = urllib2.urlopen(url);
# read the downloaded data and write it to our output file
outfile.write(infile.read());
# close the output file once we're done
outfile.close();
</code></pre>
