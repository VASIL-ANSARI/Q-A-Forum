<p>If you really need the images to be 100% visible after the overlay disappear, try to remove it when <code>$(window)</code> is loaded.</p>

<pre><code>if(index == (count - 1)) {
    $(window).on('load',function(){
        $('#temp_overlay').fadeOut('slow');
    }
}    
</code></pre>

<p>But be careful, because the users will have to wait for every content (internal and external) to be loaded before the overlay disappears. Maybe you can add a "skip loading" link.</p>
