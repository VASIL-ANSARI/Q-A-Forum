<p>It seems, that you don't have a database server running and you try to connect to a .sqlite-File.
If you have setup a database server, you can establish a database connection like this:</p>

<pre><code>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/");
</code></pre>

<p>And this line <br> <code>String query = "insert into EmployeeInfo(EID,name,surname,age) values(?,?,?,?)";</code><br> could look like <br> <code>String query = "insert into EmployeeInfo(EID,name,surname,age) values(textField.getText(),textField_1.getText(),textField_2.getText(),textField_3.getText())";</code></p>
