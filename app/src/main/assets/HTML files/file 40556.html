<p>Grouping by <code>dog.pet_pet_number, cat.pet_pet_number</code> doesn't work because your CASE in the select transforms the result in such a way that it doesn't fit GROUP BY.</p>

<p>I suppose you don't need DISTINCT as this keyword is applied to the all expressions in the select list and it doesn't make sense to have it in your case (there is already no dublicates as you're grouping)</p>
