<p>I found this to be related to recent IE slowdown. Timeout and promises were not being handled properly. However, IE within the last week (of this post) updated IE to work properly.

<p>I am also now experiencing minor readystatechange slow downs too, now that the timeout/promise issue has been resolved with the recent IE update.</p>
