<p>EDIT: You cannot overload operators in current, common browser-based implementations of JavaScript interpreters.</p>

<p>To answer the original question, one way you could do this, and mind you, this is a bit of a hack, simply <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js">serialize the two arrays to JSON</a> and then compare the two JSON strings. That would simply tell you if the arrays are different, obviously you could do this to <em>each</em> of the objects within the arrays as well to see which ones were different.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - I use and recommend <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/"><strong>MochiKit</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27030/comparing-arrays-of-objects-in-javascript#27932">The answer kamens gave</a> deserves consideration as well, since a single function to compare two given objects would be much smaller than any library to do what I suggest (although my suggestion would certainly work well enough).</p>

<p>Here is a naÃ¯ve implemenation that may do just enough for you - be aware that there are potential problems with this implementation:</p>

<pre><code>function objectsAreSame(x, y) {
   var objectsAreSame = true;
   for(var propertyName in x) {
      if(x[propertyName] !== y[propertyName]) {
         objectsAreSame = false;
         break;
      }
   }
   return objectsAreSame;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The assumption is that both objects have the same exact list of properties.</p>

<p>Oh, and it is probably obvious that, for better or worse, I belong to the only-one-return-point camp. :)</p>
