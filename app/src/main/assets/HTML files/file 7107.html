<p>Nothing is stopping you from compiling and running your MSVC code from the command line. The actual compiler is a command-line tool, so if the IDE is getting in your way, just bypass it. You could even find a Windows port of Vi, and you'd have pretty much exactly the same workflow as on Linux.</p>

<p>But <em>if</em> you choose to use a heavy-duty IDE which is designed for working with large code bases, then yes, there'll be quite a bit of overhead.</p>

<p>Unless you write a MSVC addin to make it faster and easier to do these things. (And if you do, please make it public, because a lot of us would find it useful. ;))</p>
