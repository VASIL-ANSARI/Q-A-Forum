<p>one solution would be to use the <code>window.name</code> property.
i know this solution can lead to conflicts if another library also tries to use this.
but i prefere this more then using a cookie. (you could also think over using local storage)</p>

<pre><code>function displayPopUp() {
    if( window.name != "popup-displayed" ) {
        window.name = "popup-displayed";
        ... popup code ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
