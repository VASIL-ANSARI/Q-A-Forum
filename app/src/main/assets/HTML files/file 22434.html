<p>You can clip your current URL to the number of slashes you want:</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>var relpath = window.location.pathname.match(/^(\/[^\/]*){3}/)[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Will return the first three portions of your your URL (/domain/product/version). Replace the <code>{3}</code> with any other number you want to get a different number of levels into your current path. Use this to form your AJAX URL as an absolute path (that is still sensitive to your current relative position).</p>
