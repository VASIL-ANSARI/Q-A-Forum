<p>Your data access layer needs to yield results before completing the query. It should implement IEnumerable or IDataReader. Then when you bind to it the first page of results should appear quickly.</p>

<p>Write a unit test that fetches only the first row, and a second unit test that fetches all rows. If both unit test take the same amount of time then you have problem in your DAL. Change your DAL so it yields rows early.</p>
