<p>So, some edits after the question was clarified :)</p>

<p>I suggest you create the bitmap independently of the view, then scale it to the same size as the view once the view is created. Create an arbitrary size bitmap that allows you to render what you want to it ..</p>

<pre>
// This in some class that renders your bitmap independently, and can be
// queried to get the bitmap ...
Bitmap b = Bitmap.createBitmap(100, 100, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444); 
// render something to your bitmap here
</pre>

<p>Then after your view is created, take the precreated bitmap and rescale it to the right size (I've not actually checked this by compiling it -- might be errors):</p>

<pre>
Rect original = new Rect(0, 0, 100, 100);
RectF destination = new RectF(0.0, 0.0, (float)myView.getWidth(), (float)myView.getHeight());
Canvas canvas = new Canvas(); 
canvas.drawBitmap(myRenderingClass.b, original, destination, null); 
myView.draw(canvas);
</pre>
