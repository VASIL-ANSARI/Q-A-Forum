<p>you could change all the dictonaries to string,object  ....</p>

<p>but maybe, since you are from Ruby, there's another problem going on.....</p>

<p>putting everything into dictionaries then having to work out what types they are again when extracting is perhaps not the best approach.   In typed languages, its often best to make types for everything</p>

<p>perhaps it would be better to have a typed object with the dictionaries of the type they are...</p>

<pre><code>class GameResources
{
    public Dictionary&lt;string, Map&gt; Maps { get; set;}
    public Dictoinary&lt;string, Tileset&gt; Tileset { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>etc...  or quite possibly with a bit of thought, another class structure might be more appropriate in your situation</p>
