<p>You could tie something like the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin">versions-maven-plugin</a> to your primary build such that you get a report on each build that shows whether your plugins are up to date.</p>

<p>See this link for detail on how: <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/examples/display-plugin-updates.html">Display Plugin Updates</a></p>

<p>If you want to get fancy, have your CI server run the output of your maven build through a script to check for <code>[WARNING]</code> log entries that signal new versions and then have it notify relevant members of your team via email or some other notification.</p>
