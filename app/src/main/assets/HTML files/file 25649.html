<p>I would be extremely surprised if you cannot handle the messages serially (unless you client performs particularly badly)</p>

<p>I would use a simple IO socket and a STaX event parser to decode the messages.  The Javolution XML parser is pretty quick.  I don't like Spring because it tends to make complex solutions of simple problem IMHO.  You should be able to do all this with just one class file and a few small nested classes.  Don't be afraid to write the code yourself, this is how you become a more experienced developer.</p>

<p>I would expect you should be able to handle 1000+ large XML messages per second and as much as 200,000 small XML messages per second with one reader thread.</p>
