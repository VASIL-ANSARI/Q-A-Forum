<p>I you convert your if statements to combined if else if statements than what is left in your else case will be the tie. </p>

<pre><code>if(winRow1('O' , ttt))
        System.out.println("Your game " + gameNum + ": O won the game by row 1");
else if(winRow2('O' , ttt))
        System.out.println("Your game " + gameNum + ": O won the game by row 2");
.
.
.
else
        System.out.println("Your game " + gameNum + ": It is a tie");
</code></pre>

<p>By the way,this way you could avoid multiple messages like when there are one row and one column fulticked at the same time ;). </p>
