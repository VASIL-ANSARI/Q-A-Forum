<p>For <code>int contestants[] = {1, 2, 3};</code></p>

<p><code>contestants</code> is array of 3 items of type <code>int</code> initialized by 3 literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>So literals are particular values written in the code and you should not mix terms literal (value of some type) and array (that also has a type, but is data structure).</p>

<p>Concerning your example with strings</p>

<pre><code>char s[] = "How big is it?";  //array variable
char *t = s;  //pointer variable to a string literal
</code></pre>

<p>I understand <code>t</code> as a pointer to the first element of array, that was initialized with string literal.</p>
