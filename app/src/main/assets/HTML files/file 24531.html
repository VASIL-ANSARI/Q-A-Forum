<p>Need to check the code first.
I think there is some other <code>views</code> on the <code>UIDatePicker</code>. So first check it in <code>XIB</code>. that it should be last on last <code>object</code>. And if you are using to set it by code than at the time the UIDatePicker is showing set it:</p>

<pre><code>[self.view bringSubviewToFront:datePicker];
</code></pre>

<p>You can check it by:
goto <code>setting(iphone home screen)&gt;&gt;Accessibility&gt;&gt;Accessibility Inspector&gt;&gt;select YES.</code></p>

<p>and click on you <code>UIDatePicker</code> area it will show you the information on which you are touching on.</p>
