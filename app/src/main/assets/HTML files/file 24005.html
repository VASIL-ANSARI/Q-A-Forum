<p>Short answer: Quartz.NET does not need special administrative permissions, but your jobs and other logic might.</p>

<p>You probably should start with getting logging working, <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/TarunArora/archive/2012/11/17/quartz.net-windows-service-configure-logging.aspx" rel="nofollow">here's a good tutorial</a>. After getting some logging information you probably are closer to the root cause which could be something not related directly to Quartz at all.</p>

<p>Also have try-catches around starting your service and add proper logging.</p>
