<p>You don't need two subqueries to do what you want.  Just use conditional aggregation:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT (SUM(s.month IN (october)) / SUM(s.month IN (october, november))
       ) as percent_return
FROM sales s
WHERE s.event IN ('event1', 'event2', 'event3') AND
      s.gross &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there is no need for single quotes around numeric constants.</p>
