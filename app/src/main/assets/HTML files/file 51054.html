<p>Your best option is to read the file lazily. Fetch each line one at a time and process. </p>

<p>Example:-</p>

<pre><code>Stream&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.lines(Paths.get("C:/files", "yourfile.txt"));
</code></pre>

<p>Then process the lines afterwords.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html" rel="nofollow">official</a> documentation:-</p>

<pre><code>public static Stream&lt;String&gt; lines(Path path, Charset cs) throws IOException
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read all lines from a file as a Stream. Unlike readAllLines, this
  method does not read all lines into a List, but instead populates
  lazily as the stream is consumed.</p>
</blockquote>
