<p>It's a bit late but nevertheless: there is no standard way to do that. A hacky way would be to save the report you need to a file, edit it and load back into CMS Supervisor. This way you can use almost any kind of query supported by Informix server in CMS.</p>

<p>A slightly easier and still-within-warranty way would be to dump the data you need directly from Informix, load it in Excel or whatever and process there. See my article on how to access Informix data: <a href="http://avaya.dwalin.ru/call-management-system/tutorial-using-informix-tools-to-access-cms-historical-database/" rel="nofollow">http://avaya.dwalin.ru/call-management-system/tutorial-using-informix-tools-to-access-cms-historical-database/</a></p>
