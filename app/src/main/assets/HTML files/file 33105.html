<p>What you describe is what you should do. </p>

<p>Posix Time models a posix timestamp, and it is pretty  minimalist with respect to the API:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
  <p>The class <code>boost::posix_time::ptime</code> is the primary interface for time point manipulation. In general, the <code>ptime</code> class is <strong>immutable</strong> once constructed <strong>although it does allow assignment</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it: you're <em>supposed</em> to assign a new ptime if you want to change it.</p>

<p>I can only imagine a single scenario for this, and that's when you want users to input a time value with full fidelity. In that case I'd likely bind the UI elements to separate fields for each time-part and piece together a string representation from them.</p>

<p>Then, parse your string into a <code>ptime</code> so you will have </p>

<ul>
<li>no clumsy hacking to beat <code>ptime</code> into submission to support operations it wasn't designed for</li>
<li>free input validation</li>
</ul>
