<p>It sounds like you are using the default option <code>verticalCentered:true</code> and therefore your elements inside your sections will be wrapped by the plugin. You will need to use delegation or use your javascript inside the callback <code>afterRender</code> as suggested in <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js" rel="nofollow">fullPage.js docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>afterRender()</strong></p>
  
  <p>This callback is fired just after the structure of the page is generated. This is the callback you want to use to initialise other plugins or fire any code which requires the document to be ready (as this plugin modifies the DOM to create the resulting structure).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>My other plugins don't work when using fullPage.js</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> initialize them in the 'afterRender' callback of fullPage.js.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> if you are using options such as 'verticalCentered:true' or 'overflowScroll:true' of fullPage.js, your content will be wrapped inside other elements changing its position in the DOM structure of the site. This way, your content would be consider as "dynamically added content" and most plugins needs the content to be originally on the site to perform their tasks. If you use the afterRender callback to initialise your plugins, then those elements are not going to suffer from any modification in the DOM structure anymore and will be consider to be originally in its place for the plugins you want to use from now on.</p>
