<p>You will have to store the result somewhere else. Then you can look up the results when you need them. It doesn't really make sense to "return" a result from a scheduled job because you never really have a reference to them. The API could return a promise for the first scheduled job, but that would leave all the other scheduled jobs in the dark.</p>

<p>One thing you could do is have the scheduled job push results into a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html" rel="nofollow">BlockingQueue</a>. Then elsewhere in your code you can call the <code>take()</code> method which blocks until it can pull something out of the queue. This would kind of act like a promise that is continually replenished. It would also allow the queue to fill up with out needing to worry about handling each result immediately.</p>
