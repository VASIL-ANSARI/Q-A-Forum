<p>The simple, direct answer is to make your unit-test class a friend of the class under test. This way, the unit test class can access <code>calculateChecksum()</code> even though it's private.</p>

<p>Another possibility to look at is that Foo appears to have a number of unrelated responsibilities, and might be due for re-factoring. Quite possibly, computing a check sum shouldn't really be part of <code>Foo</code> at all. Instead, calculating a checksum might be better off as a general purpose algorithm that anybody can apply as needed (or possibly, kind of the reverse -- a functor to use with another algorithm like <code>std::accumulate</code>).</p>
