<p>As the previous posters remarked, I can only guess. But from your table and view definition, I get the suspicion that you didn't model the relation between Vehicle and Order properly. A Vehicle can be used for many Orders, right? In this case, the Vehicle id must be a foreign key in the Order table. Your design is just the other way round.</p>

<p>Not related to your question, I am suspicious of your History table. The history of orders fulfilled comprises just those orders which are in the past, right? So the history would be just a view that selects orders by past values of some of the dates contained therein.</p>
