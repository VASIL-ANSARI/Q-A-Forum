<p>Qt's own OpenGL based surfaces (using QPainter) are known to be much faster than Cairo. Might you explain why you want specifically Cairo in Qt?</p>

<p>For the basics of using QPainter see <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1174421" rel="nofollow">this excerpt</a> from the book "C++ GUI Programming with Qt4", and while it's C++ code, the PyQt implementation will be parallel.</p>
