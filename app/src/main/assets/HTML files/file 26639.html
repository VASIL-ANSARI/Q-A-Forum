<li>Delete from the source column.</li>
<li>There now should be error shown on lookup element.</li>
<li>Just go in lookup element and push OK, error should be gone.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you saying that there still column is, you need to delete the line which is connecting OLE DB source and Lookup element. After that just connect again OLE DB source and Lookup elements. Again there should be error on lookup element just go in lookup element and push OK... </p>
