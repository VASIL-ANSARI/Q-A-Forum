<p>You can pass a reference of <code>window1</code> to <code>window2</code> when you construct it.</p>

<p>Then from your <code>window2</code>, you can invoke the <code>Activate</code> method on <code>window1</code> to bring it to foreground again:</p>

<pre><code>window1.Activate();
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window.activate.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN documentation</a> of this method.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since you're using <code>ShowDialog</code> instead of <code>Show</code> (you didn't mention this information at first in your question), things are a bit different: ShowDialog is supposed to display the window as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window" rel="nofollow">modal dialog</a>, and thus you <strong>cannot</strong> give the focus back to <code>window1</code> once <code>window2</code> is open, you have to close <code>window2</code> first.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what behavior you'd like to achieve, but you should try to use <code>Show</code> instead of <code>ShowDialog</code>, and then use the <code>Activate</code> method as described above.</p>
