<p>Solved this way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In practice, Instruments never worked (for me) to test an app running in a device that has a SDK newer than that Xcode's default one. Therefore, I installed the newest Xcode and now I am able to run instruments on the newest iPhone SDK.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why was I using an older version of Xcode?</strong> Because I was willing to compile to an old SDK version (older than the iOS SDK 7.0), once the Xcode5 comes with only the iOS SDK 7.0. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>So what did I do to compile with the iOS 6.1 SDK in Xcode5?</strong> I Installed a previews version of the iOS SDK in the Xcode 5. So I selected the SDK version as 6.1 instead of the iOS 7.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to install older SDK to the newest Xcode?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>4.a. U can get the iOS 6.1 SDK from
<a href="http://www.4shared.com/zip/NlPgsxz6/iPhoneOS61sdk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.4shared.com/zip/NlPgsxz6/iPhoneOS61sdk.html</a> or downloading
an older Xcode and geting the SDK from its contents</p></li>
<li><p>4.b. Unzip and paste this folder to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs</p></li>
<li>4.c. Restart the xcode.</li>
<li>4.d. U can now select an older SDK on your project's build settings</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
