<p>Okay, I finally got it to work, After some agonizing hours of half-hearted thinking...
It also uses a timer, but this time, it uses 2 timers.
Timer1 is initialized at the start of the function and every time I press a key DOWN then timer2 would equal timer1 then I check in an if statement that if</p>

<pre><code>timer1 &gt;= timer2;
</code></pre>

<p>then the texture would be removed from the screen, I also added an int which I named dialogueClick, this corresponds to the two other ints in the parameter which is currentscene and after scene.
dialogueClick should equal currentScene so that the texture would render, in the if statement that is associated with the timer, if we were to trigger an input then dialogueClick would equal to afterScene, this way I could branch multiple dialogues depending on choices. The first problem is that you can't just add 1 to dialogueClick because doing so would add numerous 1 as long as the requirements are fulfilled. I'm not on my laptop that's why I can't post the code.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's the code</p>

<pre><code>  void CChat::run(CTexture* speech, int currentDialogue, int afterDialogue, CTexture* 

character)
{
    if(scene == currentDialogue &amp;&amp; notClicked)
    {
        speech-&gt;draw();
        if(character != NULL)
        {
            nBox-&gt;draw();
            character-&gt;draw();
        }
        if(mainEvent-&gt;type == SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN)
        {
            clicked = true;
            ticking3 = ticking;
        }
        if(clicked == true &amp;&amp; mainEvent-&gt;type == SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP)
        {
            notClicked = false;
        }

        if(mainEvent-&gt;type == SDL_KEYDOWN)
        {
            if(mainEvent-&gt;key.keysym.sym == SDLK_SPACE)
            {
                clicked = true;
                ticking3 = ticking;
            }
        }
        if(clicked == true &amp;&amp; mainEvent-&gt;type == SDL_KEYUP)
        {
            if(mainEvent-&gt;key.keysym.sym == SDLK_SPACE)
            {
                notClicked = false;
            }
        }

    }
    else if(!notClicked &amp;&amp; ticking &gt;= ticking3 &amp;&amp; scene == currentDialogue)
    {
        clicked = false;
        notClicked = true;
        speech-&gt;goodBye();
        scene = afterDialogue;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's a sample of what you're supposed to use in the gameloop</p>

<pre><code>run(S1, 1, 2, Mom);
run(S2, 2, 3, Mom);
run(S3, 3, 4, Mom);
run(S4, 4, 5, Dad);
</code></pre>

<p>(Texture, current scene number, the scene number that scene moves to after it's done, and the character who is talking which I added to make the loop appear thinner)</p>

<p>I really hope this helps another person.</p>
