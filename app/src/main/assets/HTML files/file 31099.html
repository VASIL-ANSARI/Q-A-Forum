<p>Assuming that you do not want any operation on subsidiary table, you can write a trigger as follows.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_borrowing 
  AFTER INSERT ON borrowing
 FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE book
     SET subsidiary = NULL
   WHERE id_book = :NEW.book;
END;
/
</code></pre>
