<p>Just to make thing clarified, from the question you have provided, they don't actually do anything fancy with the jQuery code. What they have done is: When you click on the "li" tag, it will pass the data to the hidden input and then force the form to start submitting process.</p>

<p>If you are planning to do the same things but with multiple dropdown, the most simplest way is to use .parent().</p>

<pre><code>$("li").parent() // this will return you the &lt;ul&gt; object containing the li
</code></pre>

<p>Look at my jsfiddle for more info:</p>

<p>In my jsFiddle, I have 2 different dropdown and input (I didn't hide the input just for clarification. And didn't put it in the form or force it to submit). As you can see, I distinguish the drop down menu by id and input by class. When you click on a "li" tag, </p>

<pre><code>var parentId = $(this).parent().attr("id");
</code></pre>

<p>this will get the id of the "ul" tag contains it and use it to find the "input" tag</p>
