<p>So I found the answer after searching a bit more:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4004150/retrieve-all-posts-where-the-given-user-has-commented-ruby-on-rails?rq=1">Retrieve all posts where the given user has commented, Ruby on Rails</a></p>

<p>All I have to do is add this to the User model:</p>

<pre><code>has_many :team_enrollments, :through =&gt; :rosters, :source =&gt; :team

def teams_on
  self.team_enrollments
end
</code></pre>
