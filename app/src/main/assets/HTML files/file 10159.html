<p>Sticking to Jersey, what I've resolved to do is:</p>

<p>For a given root resource class, ensure that it has an obtainX() function which can use a service to get an instance of the referred entity via PathParams. This returns the actual domain entity, and also throws a 404 exception if not null.</p>

<p>Then another class would take the URI, use ResourceContext to get an instance of the resource, then use obtainX to get the entity. With this, any interrelationship between entities (which is only ever expressed via root entities) works. It's not the best and is definitely the least comfortable part of everything I'm doing in Jersey, but it works.</p>
