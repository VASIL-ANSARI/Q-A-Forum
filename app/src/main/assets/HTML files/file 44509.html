<p>If that is private internal in the Java library, I would guess you should not need access to it from projects consuming the library. If so, have you tried just removing the interface in the Metadata.xml file with something like:</p>

<p>&lt;remove-node path="/api/package[@name='com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication']/class[@name='AuthenticationClient.AuthenticationCompleteListener']" /&gt;</p>

<p>or (as I am not certain of the actual fully qualified path in the java library):</p>

<p>&lt;remove-node path="/api/package[@name='com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication']/class[@name='AuthenticationClient']/interface[@name='AuthenticationCompleteListener']" /&gt;</p>

<p>Also it is sometimes helpful to decompile the Java library and look at what is really going on, path wise. On a Mac I use JD-GUI and it works well. You can just open the .jar file in JD-GUI and see the whole layout of the library.
