<p>I would suggest you update the whole Google.Apis.Calendar.v3 library.
In your NuGet console, execute <code>Install-Package Google.Apis.Calendar.v3</code> to get the latest version of the package and it's dependents.</p>

<p>I was getting the same error when making calendar calls to a service account. I was using version 1.8.1.820 of the library. Updating solved the problem for me.</p>
