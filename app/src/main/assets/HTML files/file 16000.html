<p>You can use the parameter as a wildcard by assigning special meaning to NULL:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @q INT = 1
SELECT * FROM table WHERE IntegerColumn = @q OR @q IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>This way, when you pass in NULL; you get all rows.</p>

<p>If NULL is a valid value to query for, then you need to use two parameters.</p>
