<p>Your current for loop isn't actually looping through anything. If you want to iterate through the array to print out each value, here's what you do:</p>

<pre><code>for(BNRStockHolding *stockHolding in stocks) {

    NSLog(@"This stock costs: %.2f", [stockHolding costInDollars]);
    NSLog(@"The current value of this stock is %.2f", [stockHolding valueInDollars]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This really is a basic concept. I would read through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/276519/1422200">this</a> answer regarding for loop fundamentals (and maybe review some other fundamentals) before attempting to write full blown apps.</p>
