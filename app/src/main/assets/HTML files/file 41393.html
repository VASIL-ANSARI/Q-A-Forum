<p>The original code was probably copied from a library function <code>def product(*args, **kwds):</code> and kept this way to look similar to the <code>product()</code> function. Plus <code>def random_product(*args, repeat=1)</code> isn't valid in Python 2.x (kudos go to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe">jonrsharpe</a> for pointing this out).</p>

<p>Other than that, I don't see a reason to use <code>**kwds</code> here. If this was a library function that changed over time, it might be there so old arguments would be still supported but even then, I'd prefer <code>, repeat=1, **kwds)</code> to document which arguments are still supported and which are ignored.</p>

<p>To support my point, the next example reads <code>def random_permutation(iterable, r=None):</code>.</p>
