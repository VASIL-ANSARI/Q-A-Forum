<p>This answer will be about algorithms and data structures, instead of python programming.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you want to test lot of pattern against a string then you should choose a better structure for representation. Instead of char array we use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree" rel="nofollow">suffix-trees.</a> 
(For python implementations see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9347078/python-library-for-generalized-suffix-trees">this question.</a> </p></li>
<li><p>If some of your filters has common parts (especially if they have the same prefix) you should represent them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" rel="nofollow">trie(s)</a>. So this way you can test simultaneously with more than one pattern. This solution creates an overhead of building the tree(s) but if you use the same filters multiple times then it's worth.</p></li>
