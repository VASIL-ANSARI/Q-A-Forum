<p>Creating the relationship is definitely NOT a waste of time. </p>

<p>Whenever evaluating two potential solutions to a problem, you should always compare the cost/time of each option. From there you can usually make a call as to which choice is better. One thing to keep in mind is that the DataRelation exists to optimize these types of lookups.</p>

<p>If the DataRelation is being added to an existing table, approximately 125ms are required to add the relation (create the required hash to map parent/child rows via Datakeys).</p>

<p>To lookup EVERY parent row for each of the 10,000 child rows using the DataRelation required only 70ms, where using only the Linq approach documented above required over 4 minutes.</p>

<p>When you think about it, this makes sense as the first will iterate over the 10,000 child rows and use the DataRelation's mapped Datakeys to lookup the parent row (Doesn't need to iterate over all 100,000 parents). However, the second solution must traverse each child row (10,000) and search through 100,000 parent rows to find the suitable match (10,000 x 100,000 = 1,000,000,000).</p>
