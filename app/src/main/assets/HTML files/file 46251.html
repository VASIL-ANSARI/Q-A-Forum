<p>EPPLus does not generate CSV files - only xlsx format.  If you give it a .csv extension in the path it will save the file with the extension but it is still an .xlsx.  It opens because Excel is able to determine that - hence the warning.</p>

<p>If you need to generate a CSV then there are plenty of examples on how to do that without EPPlus.</p>
