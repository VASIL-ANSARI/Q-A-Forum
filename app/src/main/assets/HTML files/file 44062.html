<p>I don't know your code, but I assume that you use a ActionbarActivity. The Actionbar used there does not belong to yout layout and therefore the FrameLayout does not draw on top of it. </p>

<p>Follow this Article to create a layout in which you have controll over the ActionBar (using Toolbar): <a href="http://javatechig.com/android/android-lollipop-toolbar-example" rel="nofollow">http://javatechig.com/android/android-lollipop-toolbar-example</a></p>

<p>If that's not the Problem you could try to call View.bringToFront() on your Layout. </p>
