<pre><code>scanf("%d %d %d", &amp;one, &amp;two, &amp;three);
</code></pre>

<p>You were close, but <code>scanf</code> doesn't care about the value of those variables (which is great, because they're most likely not initialized), it cares about their addresses so it can dereference them and write inside.</p>
