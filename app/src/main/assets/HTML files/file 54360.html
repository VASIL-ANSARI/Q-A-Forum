<p>The top-level directory of a Java EE web module is considered the document root of the application. The document root is where JSP pages, client-side classes and archives, and static web resources, such as HTML/CSS/JS files, are stored.</p>

<p>Hence put such files into your war directory or any subdirectory (e.g. static).</p>

<p>However, <strong>do not put them into WEB-INF directory</strong>. It is a private area of the web application and all files under WEB-INF directory are not accessible from outside (e.g. browser).</p>
