<p>Have you statically linked your wrapper against the SQLite libraries?  Doing that should mean that everything lives within your library, rather than it just being a gateway, so the linker errors should go away.  That's assuming you're not wanting to keep the SQLite library separate from your wrapper of course.</p>
