<p>I'm doing the <strong><em>EXACT</em></strong> same thing, and trust me: if you have no previous C++ experience, this might be a bit too costly for little benefit.</p>

<p>In my case, after some profiling, I reordered things around and had an initial jump in performance only by dropping DOM and using SAX.  All the rest is only making things marginally better, like processing the response while packets are still being transmitted (i.e. not wait for the full response to start processing), and multiplexing requests on the same thread instead of starting a new thread for each.</p>

<p>What you should be looking for in Google is POSIX sockets, HTTP and REST codes, if you wish to do it all by hand.  A better option might be using CURL or something similar for the Socket/HTTP part.  I did it all myself, but only because I have already done this a few times.</p>
