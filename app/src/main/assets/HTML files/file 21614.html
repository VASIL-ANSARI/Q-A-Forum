<p>Suggest you use the <strong>removeLayer()</strong> API.  Here's the <a href="http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/docs/layers/#removing-layers" rel="nofollow">API doc</a><strike>, make sure you heed the part about calling drawLayers() after calling removeLayer()</strike>.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2013-02-16:  Since jCanvas version <a href="https://github.com/caleb531/jcanvas/commit/39fec4bf3ea68e602f2141b2ba511183e29d4412" rel="nofollow">13.02.11</a>, <strong>drawLayers()</strong> happens automatically after the user calls <strong>removeLayer()</strong>, so the explicit drawLayers() call by the user is no longer necessary.  Also since the 2013-02-13 commits, there is unit test code in the "<a href="https://github.com/caleb531/jcanvas/tree/master/tests" rel="nofollow">tests</a>" subdirectory that demonstrates the new functionality.</p>
