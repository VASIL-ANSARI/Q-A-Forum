<p>The problem is that your SSH key being used is NOT yet uploaded to Heroku. I'm not familiar with your Git client, but what you need to do is find your SSH key file, then run:</p>

<p><code>heroku keys:add /path/to/my/key.pub</code></p>

<p>This will upload your public SSH key to Heroku, allowing you to push your repository.</p>
