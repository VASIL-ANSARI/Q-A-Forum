<p>I was waaay off.  There was no problem with my code at all.  The problem was that my project had a dependency that was not compatible with a JEE module installed on the server.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.validation&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;validation-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;!--
      scope=compile prevents
      Warning:java: Cannot find annotation method 'max()' in type 'javax.validation.constraints.Size':
          class file for javax.validation.constraints.Size not found
    --&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;

&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem started when Intellij (but not Maven) began to issue warnings, such as the one above, when compiling.  The following change eliminated the MalformedParameterizedTypeException problem but reintroduced the annoying Intellij warning.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JetBrains support created a new issue in its bug tracker:  <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-127569" rel="nofollow">http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-127569</a></p>
