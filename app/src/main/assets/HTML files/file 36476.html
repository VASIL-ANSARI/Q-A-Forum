<p>Yes, a class can contain a static member of the same type as the class. Example:</p>

<pre><code>struct S {
    static S s; // declaration
};
S S::s {};      // definition
int main() {}
</code></pre>

<p>A member shall not be defined to have an incomplete type, and within the definition of a class, that class itself is incomplete. This is why you can't have a non-static member of the same type as the class itself. However, <em>declaring</em> a static member of a class does not <em>define</em> that static member. Declare it within the class definition, then define it further down.</p>

<p>If you use the static member without defining it, you will get a link error. This has nothing to do with the fact that the static member has the same type as the class. Whenever you try to use an object that hasn't been defined, you will get a link error.</p>
