<p>Won't work.  First of all, <code>WrapProtectedFunc</code> is private so you can't call it anyway.  The <code>static_cast</code> will compile, but you will get undefined behavior.  This <code>catch (std::bad_cast) {}</code> is pointless, because <code>static_cast</code> never throws.  Easy solution:  Add <code>WrapProtectedFunc</code> as a public member to A, because if your free functions need access to internals of A, well, they need access to internals of A.  And if A has any internals at all the term "abstract polymorphic interface" is not appropriate.  BTW, Your class A as specified is neither abstract nor polymorphic.</p>
