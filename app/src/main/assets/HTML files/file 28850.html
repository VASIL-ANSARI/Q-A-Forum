<p>Seems like you store the wrong string in the first place because you didn't decode it correctly. If you take a look at the <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&amp;lat=13.69362&amp;lon=100.753&amp;zoom=27&amp;addressdetails=1" rel="nofollow">query result in your browser</a> you can see that the result contains unicode escape sequences like <em>\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2d</em>. These sequences have to be decoded first. If you enter them into a web converter like <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/" rel="nofollow">http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/</a> you will start seeing the correct characters. You will have to perform a similar conversion <em>before</em> storing the string in your database.</p>
