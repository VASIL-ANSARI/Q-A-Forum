<p>There are various solutions to this request.</p>

<p>The easiest one is to use an external service such as </p>

<p><a href="http://www.webcron.org/online-cron" rel="nofollow">http://www.webcron.org/online-cron</a></p>

<p>It can run every minute. So you could get as much data as you can and caching the data while it is inserting in the DB.
But if you do not want to spend money you should go for something else.</p>

<p>Another way could be to create a PHP recursive function, a loop that once started never ends.
So until the loop finds the data on your target website it will keep running. It means you will have to start the loop only one time.
Just be sure not to echoing anything or the loop will stop once you leave the page.</p>

<p>Also you may need to trick a bit with your PHP.</p>
