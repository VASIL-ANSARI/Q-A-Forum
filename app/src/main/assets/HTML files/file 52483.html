<p>You can create an empty activity that only looks at the DB and launches the appropriate activity.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have 2 activities right now (Login and Main), the idea is that you'd have 3 activities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Root</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Main</li>
</ol>

<p>In <code>Root</code>'s <code>onCreate()</code> you'd check if the user is already logged in. If <em>yes</em>, then launch <code>Main</code>. Otherwise launch <code>Login</code>. You can keep the current logic <code>Login</code> -> <code>Main</code>.</p>

<p>Nguyen's answer keeps you to your 2 activities, but then the logic in the <code>Main</code> activity is a bit more complicated.</p>
