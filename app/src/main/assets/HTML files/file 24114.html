<p>How about replacing all <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> with spaces before you start trimming?</p>

<pre><code>$text= str_replace('&amp;nbsp;', ' ', $text)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you want to remain unicode safe, you can use <code>mb_eregi_replace</code>

<p><strong>EDIT - Second approach:</strong></p>

<p>According to this answer (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13992998/486780">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13992998/486780</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>194 160 is the UTF-8 encoding of a NO-BREAK SPACE codepoint (the same codepoint that HTML calls &nbsp;).</p>
  
  <p>So it's really not a space, even though it looks like one. (You'll see it won't word-wrap, for instance.) A regular expression match for \s would match it, but a plain comparison with a space won't.</p>

<p>Try using regexp to match for it as suggested above?</p>
