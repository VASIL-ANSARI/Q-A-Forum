<p>If you're importing, you can just make a stage which de-duplicates the data by inserting into a temporary table which has the same schema as your target table, and then executing a <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> query on it, inserting the results of this query into your final destination table. Unless you are talking about tens of millions of rows, this should work fine, since it just needs to run once.</p>
