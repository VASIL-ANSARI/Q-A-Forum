<p>Here's the regular expression that really works.
I've spent an hour surfing on the web and testing different approaches,
and most of them didn't work although Google top-ranked those pages.</p>

<p>I want to share with you a working regular expression:</p>

<pre>
[_A-Za-z0-9-]+(\\.[_A-Za-z0-9-]+)*@[A-Za-z0-9]+(\\.[A-Za-z0-9]+)*(\\.[A-Za-z]{2,})
</pre>
