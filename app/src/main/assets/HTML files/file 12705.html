<p>I just now tried out that array declaration with MinGW, and it does compile.  To make it link, though, it needs the array to be defined elsewhere.  The result is that it appears to be the same as the extern storage class:</p>

<pre><code>extern enumeratorConverterEntry enumeratorConverterEntries[];
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if there are other subtleties associated with the original declaration using a static storage class for the global.</p>
