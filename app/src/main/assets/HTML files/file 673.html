<p>I agree with your sentiments.  Coming from Microsoft development tools (and eclipse) to XCode is kind of harsh.  XCode just feels... unfinished in some respects.  It certainly doesn't have the polish that I come to expect from VS and Eclipse.</p>

<p>The SDK is similar, much of it is poorly documented, and there are a lot of holes where you know something should be, but it just isn't.  Trying to carefully control audio/video file playback is one example.</p>

<p>Objective-C, however, is great.  I really like the language, despite its quirks and idiosyncrasies (messages to null isn't a run-time exception?  really?)  Once your C++ eyes get used to the syntax, loosely-typed anonymous messaging actually ends up being really cool to play with (if somewhat dangerous and prone to RTEs.)</p>
