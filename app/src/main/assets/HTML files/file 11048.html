<p>This is too specific to answer without knowing the underlying behavior of the create_gallery function of whatever existing software you're trying to modify.</p>

<p>The best I can tell you by looking at this, is the value of your parentgallery select on the form, looks like it should be available as $_POST['parentgallery'] in the receiving function. The rest of the implementation, is too dependent on the specifics of that existing application.</p>
