<p>You are using <code>perimeter</code> in <code>calculateArea</code>, but that is only calculated in <code>calculatePerimeter</code>, which isn't called yet, so <code>perimiter</code> is still <code>0</code>.  You can simply call <code>calculatePerimeter</code> first, before calling <code>calculateArea</code>, but it may be best to call <code>calculatePerimeter</code> in <code>calculateArea</code> to make sure it's available to you.</p>

<p>Because the <code>perimeter</code> value depends on the other values, it isn't a good idea to have it as an instance variable.  You may want to return that value in <code>calculatePerimeter</code>, using it as a local variable when necessary.</p>

<p>Also, change <code>s</code> in <code>calculateArea</code> to a <code>double</code>, and divide by the <code>double</code> literal <code>2.0</code> instead of <code>2</code>, to force floating-point calculations.</p>

<p>With these changes I get correct output.</p>
