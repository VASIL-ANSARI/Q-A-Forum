<p>Just drag and drop the tab icons in the tab bar.</p>

<p>i.e. the main tab bar that belongs to the tab bar controller.</p>

<p>HTH</p>

<p>::EDIT:: So this doesn't seem to work... I'm sure it used to.</p>

<p>Anyway, the easiest way I found is to remove the tabs and add them back in the order you want them to show.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
