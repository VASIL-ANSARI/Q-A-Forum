<p>Round Robin Scheduling is the technique which executes a process for the given time slice and then appends that process at the end of the ready queue, before appending it at the end of the ready queue, it checks whether there are any other process which can be inserted in the queue(on the basis of arrival time) if such process exists then it inserts such programs in the queue and then at the end of the queue it adds the current executed process</p>
