<p>not sure if it is related, but I am seeing this message, when running an iOS app from the ToolKit-based UI:
[INFO] Launching - /private/var/mobile/Applications/0F328847-939D-4557-B58A-33ACACB3B295/device-ios.app
[INFO] Couldn't register io.trigger.forge1078daf40ad711e2acce12313d1adcbe with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code.
the app does not launch fully; it looks like the forge back-end is not ready or something?</p>

<p>If I wait a few minutes, the app will work perfectly.
weird....</p>
