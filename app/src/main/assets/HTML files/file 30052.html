<p>Assuming you're talking about writing Objective C, you specify a superclass of your class in it's <code>@interface</code> declaration after a colon. If you're doing OS X or iOS development, every class you're using probably already inherits from something. For example, your app delegate interface probably looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyAppDelegate : UIResponder
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>MyAppDelegate</code> is a subclass of <code>UIResponder</code>. Or, in the case of a view controller:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyViewController : UIViewController
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>MyViewController</code> class is a subclass of <code>UIViewController</code>. Even a "do nothing" class that isn't directly integrated into the framework will still inherit from <code>NSObject</code> by convention.</p>
