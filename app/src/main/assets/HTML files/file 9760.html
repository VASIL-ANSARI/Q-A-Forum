<pre><code>SELECT *, total.Value
FROM Purchases, (SELECT COUNT(*) as Value .... Some Really Taxing Calculation) total
WHERE Total &lt; 55 AND itemName = "Bananas"
OR Total &gt; 90 AND itemName = "Apples"
OR Total = 30 AND itemName = "Peaches"
ORDER BY Total
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, do your calculation in a nested SELECT type query in the FROM clause and give it a name of total than you can then use else where in your query.</p>
