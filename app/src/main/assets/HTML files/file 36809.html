<p>All of the places where you use <code>this.</code> in the example code are <em>unnecessary</em>.  However, it is up to you to decide whether it is "wise" or not.</p>

<p>It is a matter of opinion.</p>

<p>Some people think that using <code>this.</code> improves readability makes it explicit that the field or method you are using / calling is a member of the target class.  I don't think that it helps, except possibly for Java beginners.</p>

<p>However, there are cases where it is <em>necessary</em> to qualify with <code>this</code>; e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class Example {
    private int field;
    public void setField(int field) {
        this.field = field;  // 'this' is required here ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you are asking about ... <code>skills.getRoughSkillDamageModified(this)</code>, there is absolutely nothing "unwise" about passing the current object's reference as a parameter to some other method or constructor.</p>
