<p>You can do dynamic arrays and use <code>realloc()</code> when it needs to grow. If possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since your initial array to be (perhaps) the average length you expect</li>
<li>Use exponential growth, so that when you do reallocate the array, you double the allocated size</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, you could also do something more intricate, but I would recommend testing with plain reallocated arrays first.</p>
