<p>I think I've tried this before.  It's hacky, but for whole-table ORM query results, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd

cols = [c.name for c in SQLA_Table.__table__.columns]
pk = [c.name for c in SQLA_Table.__table__.primary_key]
tuplefied_list = [(getattr(item, col) for col in cols) for item in result_list]

df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(tuplefied_list, index=pk, columns=cols)
</code></pre>

<p>Partial query results (NamedTuples) will also work, but you have to construct the DataFrame <code>columns</code> and <code>index</code> to match your query.</p>
